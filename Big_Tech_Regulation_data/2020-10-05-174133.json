Amazon.com Inc.has fallen a total of 4.5 per cent over the same period. Netflix Inc.is down 8.7 per cent and Google Inc.(whose parent company is Alphabet Inc.) is down 4.2 per cent.</p><p>Beyond FANG, Apple Inc.has fallen 6.3 per cent over the past two days and Microsoft Corp. has declined 2.9 per cent - adding up to a big headache for big tech.</p><p>Monday's action coincided with a high-profile downgrade: Mizuho Securities lowered its recommendation on Apple to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" and cut its price target to $150 (U.S.) from $160 - essentially arguing that the high share price already reflects the benefits of new iPhones and other gadgets.</p><p>\"The stock has meaningfully outperformed on a year-to-date basis and we believe enthusiasm around the upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels,\" Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba said, according to Reuters.</p><p>That's just one analyst's opinion - 36 others recommend Apple as a \"buy\" - but it taps into market sensitivity toward valuations at a time when many big tech stocks have diverged from the broader market.</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Netflixand Facebook had risen more than 30 per cent each this year, before the two-day setback, triple the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Googlewas a comparative slouch, but nonetheless had risen 24 per cent.</p><p>Even with the two-day decline, these stocks are still up between 18 per cent and 24 per cent this year - which suggests that if outperformance is a concern, the turbulence could persist.</p><p>The market's nervousness began on Friday after Goldman Sachs released a research note that asked, \"Is 'FANG' mispriced?\" Over the next 10 pages of text and charts, the note identified risks associated with recent strong returns.</p><p>\"This outperformance, driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative, has created positioning extremes, factor crowding and difficult-to-decipher risk narratives,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in their note.</p><p>That is, hedge funds and mutual funds have stuffed their portfolios with the same technology stocks, as managers chase companies that can deliver profit and revenue growth regardless of the political or economic backdrop. As any contrarian investor will tell you, popularity can hurt when it ends.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts noted that the recent low volatility of tech stocks has been another draw for investors, but could be hiding the risks associated with these stocks.</p><p>\"We believe low realized volatility can potentially lead people to underestimate the risks inherent in these businesses including cyclical exposure, potential regulations regarding online activity or antitrust concerns or disruption risk as they encroach into each other's businesses,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said.</p><p>For that matter, perhaps investors have become accustomed to a smooth ride in the broader market as well. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied 32 per cent since February, 2016, and the worst setback over this period was a mere 6-per-cent decline over a three-week period last June.</p><p>It's hardly cheap, either. The index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.5, according to Bloomberg - a 16-year high and the highest valuation over the course of the nine-year-old bull market. When stock prices are rising faster than profits, investors have a good reason to be cautious.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: Dropping stocks prove a big headache for big tech investors The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20170612escenic_35287310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NSD-1GB1-F072-J121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><timeReceived>6:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

In a Feb. 24 op-ed 'Why Republicans Can't Win in 2020,'[2] he observed that Big Tech companies 'can shift opinions and votes in numerous ways that people can't detect' and shared intercepted emails and studies to prove it. His solution: 'monitor them aggressively.'One sinister development he noted was that Big Tech companies 'can use these techniques without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.' </p><p>He pointed to leaked Google emails , citing a piece from The Wall Street Journal in 2018, and noted how 'one Googler asks his colleagues how the company can use 'ephemeral experience[s]' to change people's views about Trump's travel ban.'Dr. Epstein defined 'Ephemeral experience[s]' as those which are 'generated on-the-fly and isn't stored anywhere,' such as: 'newsfeeds, search suggestions, search results, and so on.' Linking to some of his own research, a piece headlined 'Manipulating Minds: The Power of Search Engines to Influence Votes and Opinions[3],' Epstein suggested 'dozens of randomized, controlled, double-blind experiments,' demonstrate 'such content can dramatically shift opinions and voting preferences.'While he acknowledged that Russia has interfered in past elections, he says the nation's influence was severely overblown. 'Generally speaking,' he wrote, 'all they can do is throw some biased content onto the internet. But content isn't the problem anymore.'Google and Facebook, however, are the actual kingmakers in America today, Epstein proposed. He recalled his testimony before congress, in which he said Big Tech can 'easily shift 15 million votes to that candidate without people knowing and without leaving a paper trail.' He also made another critical point:'Google and Facebook have millions of pieces of information about every American voter, and they will be targeting their manipulations at the individual level for every single voter in every swing state. No one in the world except Google and Facebook can do that.'He lamented that 'it's too late for any law or regulation to make a difference\u2014at least in the upcoming election.'But for now, Epstein suggested, 'We need to look over the shoulders of a diverse group of thousands of American voters\u2014with their permission, of course\u2014to aggregate and measure the ephemeral content that Google-and-the-Gang are showing them every day.'Then, 'when bias is detected that has the potential to shift votes, it needs to be reported immediately' to the authorities and the media so that the Big Tech executives will back off. And 'if they don't, they'll be risking humiliation, fines, and, quite possibly, criminal prosecution.'Dr. Epstein said he is building a monitoring system now, an expanded version of the systems he used in 2016[4] and 2018[5], and invited those who agree with him to lend their support[6].Dr. Epstein has been warning America[7] about this Big Tech technocracy for a while, and was cited in a documentary the 'Creepy Line'[8] explaining how Google manipulates search results in order to sway elections. He testified in front of Congress and estimated that Google could have robbed Trump of at least 2.6 million votes in 2016.

The most recent edition, \u201cThe Spirit of Truth in a Digital Age,\u201d reflects on how our perceptions of reality are becoming dependent on the way communication and information ecosystems are organized and regulated as technology has developed.</p><p>When we talk about \u201ctoday\u2019s technology,\u201d we aren\u2019t always referring to something brand new, are we?</p><p>Dr Brown: Sometimes, in terms of ecumenical communication, we talk today of global technology as if we\u2019re dealing with a new issue. It has been almost 60 years since people first starting talking about living in a global village. Suddenly, through satellite broadcasting, you could see what was going on in other parts of the world almost instantaneously: events were happening throughout the world, which had become a village. Even then, we raised questions about the people, the institutions, the technologies that were controlling those images. We asked: \u201cWhy did they select what they did?\u201d So in one sense we\u2019re facing many of the same questions we\u2019ve always been facing. But digital transformation has brought some new aspects, including immediacy, accessibility and particularly the idea of \u201cmany-to-many\u201d communication, as opposed to radio or TV broadcasting, which was \u201cone-to-many.\u201d Radio or TV involved broadcasting from a centre to reach many people. Now, digital communication has brought people together across continents, and for a global institution like the WCC, that\u2019s a positive aspect.</p><p>As we bring together people globally, what are some of the gifts and some of the challenges?</p><p>Dr Brown: With the digital era, we can involve more people, and we can expand those taking part to include not just church leaders or church representatives but many other people with important things to say. That\u2019s really one of the major things the digital era offers us, particularly with COVID-19 when people can\u2019t travel: we are suddenly discovering some of these possibilities to stay in touch. At the local level, digital technology in this time of lockdown really offers something for people to stay together\u2014locally and not just globally. During a time of physical distancing, it\u2019s difficult to gather together but we can do so using technology. It may not be the same, but it can still be a real gift. I recently attended an online communion service, and it was a real worship experience, not a broadcast, not a performance. I got so much out of it!</p><p>In terms of challenges, time itself becomes an issue in a global meeting. In fact, simply planning a start and finish time for a meeting can become very tricky! In previous eras, global meetings involved people arriving via ships, back in the early days, when that\u2019s the only way people physically gathered across continents. The meeting time was easier to set then!</p><p>How can we navigate around or through \u201cfake news?\u201d</p><p>Dr Brown: Fake news has always been with us. In the Bible, Exodus 23 says: \u201cThou shalt not raise a false report.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t spread fake news!</p><p>There is a huge flood of information on all fronts: online newspapers, social media \u2013whether it\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed because there is so much out there. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know how to deal with all the information. Then there\u2019s the fact that, with a lack of person-to-person communication, people sometimes react immediately without thinking.</p><p>Fake news can be purposeful disinformation when people consciously put it out there. But sometimes it\u2019s more of what I would call \u201cmisinformation.\u201d It may not always be that people are consciously trying to decide to share or propose fake news. People share things unconsciously \u2013 sometimes even with the best of intentions.</p><p>We also have to be aware that there are algorithms behind us in social media, algorithms that are trying to pull us in by giving us more of what we want. Dealing with fake news isn\u2019t only about technological or social media literacy, though it does include that, but also about the ecumenical community challenging some of the global tech giants. When algorithms are so sensitive that they can know our personality better than we can know ourselves \u2013 it must surely be possible for Big Tech to develop algorithms that deal with hate speech and fake news.</p><p>Can you talk more about our challenges as an ecumenical fellowship?</p><p>Dr Brown: One of the challenges or tasks for our ecumenical fellowship is to try to find ways to make sure we are sharing reliable information. Of course we try to distinguish between good and bad information but it\u2019s always not as simple as that! There are so many levels of accuracy when we have the immediacy of our digital age. And, with physical distancing, you don\u2019t always have people close by to discuss and share with face-to-face. Regarding COVID-19, there is so much we don\u2019t know, then our knowledge increases and our options change. Ultimately it\u2019s important to realize that uncertainty is not always a bad thing. Particularly in times of uncertainty, people can be looking for certainty and for a reassuring answer, then the answer leads to fake news being propagated. People may distribute fake news because they want it to be true. Sometimes it\u2019s important to admit: \u201cwe are not sure.\u201d But that\u2019s different than saying, \u201cwe\u2019re just hopeless.\u201d</p><p>The other great challenges of digital communication are related to the issues of justice and peace. How does digital communication promote structures of injustice? Who does it include and who does it exclude? I remember that I used to write articles and give addresses about how social media was a positive thing that enabled communities and groups to organize, and lifted up voices that had previously been silenced. Now, eight or nine years later, we\u2019re talking about social media as a realm for populist dissemination and misinformation. So we need to try to look at our communities in a wider social and political context, and ask how communication technology relates to the bigger picture.</p><p>Ultimately the challenge of digital communication is not about technology, it\u2019s about what it means to be human, and what it means to be made in the image of God; the God whose \u201cspirit of truth,\u201d as J\u00fcrgen Moltmann puts it in the opening article of this issue of The Ecumenical Review, \u201cdrives us onward to search for truth and chase after peace.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3286187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW6-N341-JDG9-Y3VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1073\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 9, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000309</classCode><className>CLERGY &amp; RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N515210MM</classCode><className>SATELLITE TELEVISION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N515000CC</classCode><className>BROADCASTING INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009G61</classCode><className>SATELLITE BROADCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The 55-year-old, who flew packages for FedEx after a 28-year career with the US Air Force, appeared a picture of middle-aged vigour. But, immediately suspecting the worst, his doctor ordered tests. Days later he was diagnosed with breast cancer, a disease that has spread to his bones. </p><p>With women accounting for 99 of every 100 cases of the condition, Holmes became an unfortunate member of the 1 per cent club. Yet eight years since his diagnosis, he also stands as a symbol of an idea fast gaining traction in the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 that data itself can be the drug that unlocks faster cures, bigger markets and higher profits. </p><p>It is an approach that is gaining momentum in the pharmaceutical industry, with potential benefits for patients not only in richer countries but also poorer ones, including recent applications in research on malaria treatments. As non-communicable diseases such as those linked to diabetes become more prevalent alongside infectious conditions, it will have increasing global relevance. But that will also depend on new funding models and access to data</p><p>Holmes\u2019s disease is kept in check by Ibrance, a medicine developed by Pfizer in the US and approved by regulators only for \u201cpost-menopausal\u201d women. Customarily, securing permission to prescribe an existing drug to a wider group of patients would have required full-blown clinical trials that might have delayed the change for several years. </p><p>Yet in a world where Big Pharma and Big Tech collide, investors are pouring billions of dollars into companies that offer access to the clinical insights contained in vast troves of anonymised patient records. Combined with artificial intelligence, the data offer hope of expanding the number of patients who can benefit from existing medicines, or even unearthing entirely new drugs. </p><p>Chris Boshoff, chief development officer for Pfizer\u2019s oncology division, says: \u201cTo conduct a study in men, because we didn\u2019t include them in [the initial studies], would have taken us another three to five years and here we could do all the work within 12 months and get the expansion.\u201d</p><p>For Niven Narain, co-founder of biotech group Berg, \u201cthe concentration and the sexiness started in discovery but the digital health world has grown exponentially in the past year. Eighteen months ago if I sat here I couldn\u2019t even tell you what a chief digital officer was,\u201d he adds, reeling off the names of Big Pharma companies such as Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi that now have digital experts on their leadership teams.</p><p>For executives preoccupied with improving pharma\u2019s poor record on productivity, the power of data to accelerate drug discovery and reduce research costs represents fresh hope for corporate profits as well as patients. Getting a drug from bench to bedside can cost $2.6bn, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, and take up to 14 years. </p><p>Zach Weinberg, co-founder of Flatiron Health, which aggregated and analysed part of the data underpinning Ibrance\u2019s label expansion to men, believes two major shifts in the landscape are driving pharma\u2019s fascination with data. The first is a demand from insurers and other payers for more detailed evidence about the performance of a drug once it is in regular use. The other is the increasing complexity of drug discovery, as scientists\u2019 greater understanding of individual biology drives the search for more personalised treatments. </p><p>Weinberg says: \u201cIf you wanted to launch a drug in breast cancer 20 years ago, we would have thought of it as breast cancer. But now we think of it as multiple subtypes of disease, so the need to generate evidence in each individual subtype means there are more questions [to be answered].\u201d These developments have placed a premium on high quality data, shorn of mistakes and inconsistencies, that will be trusted by regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Securing access to data from electronic health records \u201cis really not that complicated. Making that data fit for research, that\u2019s the hard part. It\u2019s in the data curation,\u201d he adds.</p><p>Medical applications for data and AI have rapidly become attractive to investors. Calculations for the Financial Times by Rock Health, a US venture fund focusing on digital health, suggest that in the five years to the third quarter of 2019 a total of $1.5bn across 69 deals was invested in companies that use AI or machine learning, and that \u201ceither sell to biopharma or have biopharma as an end user\u201d. </p><p>Even five or six years ago, only about half the 20 biggest companies working on cancer drugs were deploying real world data, says Weinberg. \u201cNow, when we walk into any of the 20 [businesses] there\u2019s a group that has been identified which at least owns the area for that. It\u2019s about augmenting and complementing clinical trials where we don\u2019t have enough trial data. That\u2019s really the big idea.\u201d </p><p>Basel-based Roche has embraced that approach. In 2015 it took a 12.6 per cent stake in Flatiron, going on to buy the company outright in 2018. The relationship has delivered clear dividends, suggests Bill Anderson, Roche\u2019s head of pharma. He cites Rozlytrek, a treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer approved by the FDA in August, which targets genetic mutations seen in only about 1 per cent of all patients with the condition. </p><p>Roche used Foundation Medicine, a US company that genetically sequences tumours, to identify a group of patients with the right genetic make-up on whom to test the medicine. It then created the equivalent of another trial using the Flatiron database to find a group of patients with the same mutations who were taking what had been regarded, up to that point, as the best treatment. Anderson says: \u201cWe needed a 2m-patient Flatiron data set to find approximately 50 patients that had [the relevant] mutation, and it fit the trial criteria.\u201d </p><p>At Novartis, Switzerland\u2019s other global drugmaker, Vas Narasimhan describes his business as \u201ca data science company\u201d. While identifying molecules that could turn into money-spinning drugs is the traditional business of Big Pharma, the key insight, on which he has sought to reposition the company since becoming chief executive in 2018, is that the data generated around those molecules are also core assets. </p><p>Novartis is increasingly looking to integrate anonymised data from clinical trials with other information about patients, such as their genetic make-up, to find the \u201csuper-responders\u201d most likely to benefit from new treatments. Narasimhan says: \u201cIf you look at the tech companies that\u2019s the pivot they made; they realised that actually the core asset for them is the data-mining [of] all of that experience.\u201d</p><p>Take canakinumab, a medicine for heart disease that had disappointed in initial trials. Rather than writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, Novartis took the data of the 10,000 patients involved in these initial studies and \u201cdiscovered that this drug has a significant impact on lung cancer\u201d, he says. </p><p>The company has now embarked on several late-stage trials of the drug among people with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the condition. Recent moves attest to Narasimhan\u2019s belief that Big Pharma must increasingly leverage the skills and approach of tech specialists. </p><p>The most profitable outcome for many pharma companies would be to find a brand new drug by applying AI to big data sets \u2014 but Narasimhan strikes a note of caution. \u201cCan we use this technology to find the drug, to actually unlock the underlying science? I still think we\u2019re a long way away [from that] because we don\u2019t understand so much about human biology. And to define how a machine would solve that for us would require significant advancement still.\u201d</p><p>Berg\u2019s Narain believes this year will deliver a reckoning that could explode some of the hype that has been generated around AI and medicine. Founded just over a decade ago, the biotech group has carved out a distinct path by testing hypotheses developed through computer modelling in an experimental laboratory setting. The aim is to produce a biologically validated finding that can then be further tested in animal and human clinical trials \u2014 a process that takes time, he emphasises. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you pool public data and you\u2019re going to cure cancer in three months,\u201d he says. It has teamed up with several large pharma companies, including AstraZeneca and Sanofi, in work that Narain believes can eventually lead to new drugs by yielding fresh insights into how they produce their effects. </p><p>However, he warns against the notion that AI is a short-cut that can circumvent all the hard work of understanding patient biology. \u201cAI is not just like a magic wand that dismisses all the iterations of the science that are so necessary to get to a really verifiable answer. Because at the end of the day we\u2019re dealing with patients.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article is adapted from a version published in the FT in January 2020</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-8f5de4e2684711eaa6ac9122541af204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX8-WWT1-JB77-K3JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1537\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 16, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000214H</classCode><className>PFIZER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS325411 MEDICINAL &amp;

We have to do something about that.\" (See Djingo Unchained: Orange, DT Take AI Fight to US Tech Giants.)</p><p>This may seem like an auspicious time for European indignation. Edward Snowden and revelations about the Facebook Cambridge Analytica affair have shown that US authorities and tech giants cannot be trusted on European soil. The introduction this year of the US CLOUD Act (CLOUD standing for Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data) has heightened concern that US authorities can barge into any US company's data center, anywhere on the planet, in the interests of national security (although the reality is far more nuanced). (See Facebook: The Sick Man of Silicon Valley.)</p><p>In the meantime, China's Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. risks becoming 5G vendor non grata in Europe after the most turbulent few months in its history. Unlike the US National Security Agency and Facebook, it has never been shown to have spied on European citizens or abused customer data. But the mere possibility is enough for US authorities -- with their own nervousness about Chinese tech dominance -- to complain about it to Europeans. A desperate Vincent Peng, the president of Huawei's business in Western Europe, told the Financial Times (subscription required) that Huawei would do \"anything\" to restore confidence. Unfortunately, it cannot stop being Chinese. (See Orange Rules Out Huawei for 5G in France and How the West Can Hurt Huawei.)</p><p>Caught in the crossfire of this tech battle between the US and China, Europe sometimes appears like fodder for either. Its heavily regulated telecom markets are too crowded, say critics, and they already lag international rivals in the race to build economically vital 5G networks. Ericsson AB (Nasdaq: ERIC) and Nokia Corp. (NYSE: NOK), its most successful tech companies, are more than a century old and under threat from baby-faced software developers. European indifference is no help, either: Just 51% of companies in Germany believe in the potential of artificial intelligence, according to Hottges, compared with 91% in China and 97% in the US.</p><p>To Hottges and Richard, Europe is a colossal underachiever, weighed down by apathy and regulation like Superman with kryptonite in his boots. It produces many of the world's best engineers and features some of its most prestigious universities, said Richard. Technology startups from the region have produced some of the world's most groundbreaking innovations. Think of Luxembourg's Skype, now a part of the Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) empire, or the UK's DeepMind, a pioneer in artificial intelligence that Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) bought in 2014.</p><p>But the takeover of these two companies by US Big Tech points to the most uncomfortable truth about Europe: Its sheer dependence on the US and China. That laid bare a few absurdities at Orange's event in Paris this month. Even as they were castigating the \"global tech guys,\" and championing their own digital assistant as a European alternative, Hottges and Richard were announcing a partnership with Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN). Customers who buy one of the forthcoming smart speakers from Orange or Deutsche Telekom AG (NYSE: DT) will be able to choose between the telcos' digital assistant and Amazon's Alexa. Amazon's interest in featuring an Alexa rival on its own hardware remains unclear.</p><p>When it comes to the telcos' strategy, blocking access to the Internet giants would be counterproductive, and smack of the \"walled garden\" approach that proved such a disastrous failure after the dotcom boom. Yet analysts are skeptical that European nationalism or privacy fears will prompt consumers to pick Djingo, Orange's name for its digital assistant, over Alexa. Despite widespread coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and reports that Russia used Facebook to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election, there has been no European exodus from the US social network.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Light Reading India.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being embraced by greater numbers of individuals, businesses, and governments as rising efficiency and productivity are permitting exponential growth in certain sectors of the global economy. The first tech ambassador in the world Casper Klynge, thinks that now is the future of technology innovation, digital economies, and e-government.

Well, today everything zips along at light speed, wars on laptops, diplomacy through technology. And that is why we are here live the World Government Summit in Dubai to take you to the movers and shakers figuring out how to build a better future, our future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Becky Anderson and this is of course \"CONNECT THE WORLD.\" Well, a high-tech higher stakes and big questions. That's what it's all about here in Dubai where 4,000 politicians experts and thought leaders from 150 countries have gathered to accomplish one thing, to \"set the agenda for the next generation of government.\" And if the conversation is anything to go by that, next generation is very high-tech, expect artificial intelligence, pipe loops and robots. The stakes are even higher, climate change, global inequality, and the mental health of us, the citizens.</p><p>And there is one very big question, can government keep up? Well, CNN's Richard Quest and John Defterios joining me with the big themes. And that is a really good question. When you come to an event like this, Richard, and you've been speaking to example -- for example to Christine Lagarde today from the IMF. This is all about what governments can do for us next. How can they keep up?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: And the interesting thing about this particular summit is I would say this year it's come of age. This year that I've had a real feeling that the right people are here for the right reasons discussing the right issues. I passed an A.I. forum and it was just fascinating. Seven or eight different little booths going on at the same time packed with people.</p><p>And he message is simple -- and it was a similar one from Davos, by the way, as you would remember from there. A.I. and the fourth Industrial Revolution is now here. Government has to deal with it. And then -- what I'm hearing here is it's the methods and the ways in which they do it.</p><p>ANDERSON: Technology innovation, those are the sort of buzzwords here. The politicians are here. They are talking about these new digital economies and how we will be shaped by governments as it were going forward. There are those some traditional conversations going on not least those about Brexit, about trade wars. What have you heard?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, that's the dichotomy here. They're looking to the future. That's what it's supposed to be doing this world government summit, to hear from the brain trust the Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan right now is on the stage looking at the geopolitical mapping. One of the key geopolitical issues clearly is Brexit today, not by accident. The international trade secretary for the U.K. Liam Fox was here. This is a trading nation.</p><p>It was -- in fact you're talking about the Silk Road, and the spice route, and the spices that were traded from here, he wants to come and say we're not insulated because of Brexit. We're going to be more global afterwards. That's not an easy sale but he has to basically make that pitch at the crossroads of east and west here in the UAE.</p><p>Now, his arguments there was just interesting after a lot of heat. He's suggesting back to you that Europe is going to need to be more flexible. The U.K. is a $2.5 trillion economy. Germany is slowing down, China is slowing down and it's not about politics but about the economic future of Europe and that flexibility. Let's take a listen to Liam first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM FOX, INTERNATIONAL TRADE SECRETARY, UNITED KINGDOM: I think the whole question of Brexit is always really been about is this a political separation? Are the priorities to the -- for the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and the purity of the European project or is it about prosperity, jobs, and trade? And I think that the pendulum has tilted towards the latter in the last few months as the effect of the Chinese slowdown has brought a recognition that Europe, the European economy on both sides of the channel I can't take unwarranted disruption.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: So unwarranted obstruction here to trade. That's Liam Fox's position. By the way, this is the government summit where they hone in on their future trading partners. But eight years ago before the WGS was founded, it was China, last year you know was India bringing a trading partners of $70 billion $100 billion for the UAE. And now their focus is on the Horn of Africa, focusing on the very fast growth of Ethiopian.</p><p>And I think Liam Fox wanted to come and say we want to be part of it. we're going to form new trade agreements but a horrible week in last two weeks in fact at the U.K. You had Dyson moving its headquarters to Singapore with that announcement. UBS moving funds from London as the Swiss Bank to Germany. Nissan is saying it wasn't going to proceed with a diesel project here.</p><p>He was trying to shrug all those things off and I think almost trying to bury his head in the sand and saying we will be open. We will be open, but the hard deadlines coming.</p><p>[10:05:33] ANDERSON: Yes. We had this at Davos as well didn't we? The signs were up. Britain is open for business.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: That was extraordinary. He put an advertising on the hotel.</p><p>QUEST: Great Britain on the Belvidere of all places. Yes. Free trade, Christine Lagarde, I was -- I was talking to about A.I., what it's going to mean fourth industrial and all that. And I said you know, jobs that will be lost. And she immediately slapped me down and she says, no, Richard you mean jobs that will be adjusted. And what she's worried about interesting, fascinating, is she says that women will be most affected or at least stand to be more effective because those jobs that women do currently in the workforce because of the discrimination and precious. They are the ones that will go.</p><p>ANDERSON: So what's the upside?</p><p>QUEST: The upside is that if we get it right. It's an increase of wealth for the whole world. The upside is you know, people having more and more interesting exciting, more and lives, meaningful lives is the relevant for. The downside doesn't bear thinking about you know, none of us so for, obviously, we're around for the first industrial revolution. Well, maybe. But you know, if you look at -- think of Spinning Jennies and thereafter, and this is -- this will be bigger.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: What's extraordinary here, I think and you know this because we live here, they're embracing their futures so they're using the summit every year in advancing. We've gone into the -- to the museum here of the future. They're advancing the thought process and the technology 75 years out. It's extraordinary.</p><p>ANDERSON: A.I. --</p><p>DEFTERIOS: And people do embrace it because it's --</p><p>ANDERSON: And A.I. embedded across every --</p><p>QUEST: They've got -- they've got the right people here. Never mind the top liners or the headliners that you might see somewhere else, they've got a few of them. But they've got the experts from MIT, they've got the science labs, they've got Silicon Valley. They've actually got the people that understand.</p><p>ANDERSON: And what I thought was really interesting, I'm about to show of our viewers an interview that I conducted earlier with the Estonian class. So this is a small country of 1.6 million but a country that is something like third or fourth rated when it comes to encouraging a new tech in word generation, looking for research and development money in the world of innovation.</p><p>And one expert suggesting recently is countries like Estonia that are stealing and march on nonetheless than the U.S. when it comes to tech advances.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, Estonia and Latvia, you know, these -- they were the ones that embraced E-government. And in fact the bottle that we see today, we go through the airports for example, you can use your identity card that we live here with without the password and sliders through the E-gate or E- government services online, the inspiration came from Estonia. That's why you see the prime minister of Estonia --</p><p>QUEST: (INAUDIBLE) cabinet meetings. They all turn up to cabinet -- they all turn up to cabinet where --</p><p>ANDERSON: We hope so.</p><p>QUEST: Just like you, Becky --</p><p>ANDERSON: We got (INAUDIBLE) working on the old paper. It makes me feel confident and comfortable in my job. Thank you guys.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: The two mega minds on CNN. They break the news and break it all down for you. Let's zip to the border then between Russia and the European Union. That is where of course what we've just been talking about, Estonia lies, Europe's digital leader or should that be Estonia. It's a small place but it's a big presence here at the summit in Dubai.</p><p>It's been building its tech creds in a big way. It is as we have suggested an E-state where 99, it this 99 percent of public services are now available online and around the clock but can it take, provide stability in a continent shaken by Brexit? Estonia's Prime Minister Juri Ratas join me earlier and I began by asking about the future of the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. This is fascinating. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JURI RATAS, PRIME MINISTER, ESTONIA: I think the Brexit for the broad sides are very negative. What is today is important. I think of course we must understand that 52 percent is the people from Britain -- from United Kingdom they said that they would like to see that U.K. is out of E.U.</p><p>ANDERSON: Truth.</p><p>RATAS: OK. But actually we need after the 29th of March, we need very strategic and I would like to say very close relations between 27 and U.K. That's true that we booked our proposal on the day of 25th of November last year and I couldn't see today any this kind of movement that we are opening this agreement project.</p><p>[10:10:13] ANDERSON: So you see a no deal Brexit at this point do and you are concerned about that?</p><p>RATAS: I see that 27 countries and I also see the Prime Minister May were both are working to have a deal.</p><p>ANDERSON: Is she being a stubborn woman?</p><p>RATAS: I think that the no deal isn't the best for both sides. I really hope and I really believe today that we could find the deal. And it is important to both sides and I see every council meeting that all these 27 countries but also Prime Minister May, we are we are working to achieve this goal, to find this opportunity.</p><p>ANDERSON: Tell me, behind the scenes, are European leaders still hoping for a second referendum?</p><p>RATAS: I think some leaders or maybe majority of our my colleagues, we are hoping that this tour is little bit still open that we could see that European Union is going forward with 28 countries. Maybe it's today more fairytale than this kind of true life but let's see. How to say -- it isn't today our question, I mean, 27 country's question.</p><p>ANDERSON: There are many Estonians in the U.K. what are your biggest concerns about a no deal post March the 29th for your own citizens?</p><p>RATAS: In United Kingdom, we have about 10,000 or 15,000 Estonians. The most important things are the citizen's rights and also the rights of the business. I think that is the most important. Also for this very important for Estonia is to keep these very strategic relations between U.K. and Estonia if we are talking to security and defense. and what is actually very good at under the NATO umbrella we are -- we are still together this 29 countries.</p><p>ANDERSON: Let's talk about NATO very briefly. You've said that you want better relations with Russia. Do you still now even after election meddling in the U.S. and in the Ukraine -- I know that there are U.K. troops for example as part of the NATO mission in your country. How concerned are you?</p><p>RATAS: The first thing where we all need the answers is Minsk agreements. Is what -- is the situation what the Russian Federation is doing today in Ukraine, the eastern part, in Crimea. We must just see some positive steps. Of course I think all E.U. countries, we understand that we need the dialogue, but dialogue is I think possible. After that we could see the positive solutions or good solution under the Minsk agreement.</p><p>ANDERSON: So you want to see better relations with Russia is what you're telling me.</p><p>RATAS: Like I said, the first that must be -- it's about -- fort the Baltic States and for Estonia, it is so important. If we are talking to independence, if we are talking to freedom, if we are talking to territorial integrity and sovereignty, and of course we are supporting Ukraine 101 percent about that, and after that we could talk and other issues as well, but the first is Minsk agreement.</p><p>ANDERSON: You have this E-residency idea for example. You had to though suspend that program I know after a major security flaw one that you kept under wraps for a while. Does it concern you that we live in a world of big data that can be so easily manipulated?</p><p>RATAS: Like I said -- actually we need this kind of free movement of data. If we -- if we need a better medicine, better than airfield, better education, better security, but at the same time maybe a little bit in front we need all different things what are under the security, these are the data security and all the cyber security. We had very strong cyber- attacks during springtime 2007. Of course, now we are much preparations. We are much better know how and also --</p><p>ANDERSON: And many people are involved in hacking around the world.</p><p>RATAS: -- not hacking, also more people are doing to cooperation in the world and also entirely know how the need to cyber-security center as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: The Prime Minister of Estonia there. A very human guess you probably notice, and that is actually kind of important because soon up next, we will meet Anymals and take a look at this. I promise you, it won't bite. He's beside you. Look how he looks at the world literally like this. Thermal vision guys, thermal vision. Super cool. He is dancing for us at the moment which he reminds me of somebody else. Look at that.</p><p>[10:15:13] QUEST: I don't know what you're suggesting.</p><p>ANDERSON: What's really important is that this is a government summer as we've been discussing but it's -- but it's Anymals like this that companies will be showing off an event like this because this is about the future, John.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes. What he doing? What's his capabilities is what I want to find out.</p><p>ANDERSON: We're going to find next.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes. It's good to see.</p><p>QUEST: This is extraordinary.</p><p>ANDERSON: You're frightened.</p><p>QUEST: No. It's just I've seen robots but they're all sort of talking about -- but this is actually starting to get the dexterity and the maneuverability and I'm -- hello!</p><p>ANDERSON: It waved for you.</p><p>QUEST: It did. Not the first one.</p><p>ANDERSON: We're going to take a very short break viewers. Up next that and some other world news. As Iran gears up to celebrate the anniversary of its Islamic Revolution, we are live in Tehran to take the temperature.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, we are connecting your world from here at the World Government Summit in Dubai and why these -- while sometimes these get- togethers like Davos where I was recently, you can feel like they're in a bubble of isolation. That is far from the case of course. That's why we are connecting the world so much in flux around the world. Case in point of such changes is a time for celebration.</p><p>In Iran it seems as the country marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. That is when the government of the U.S.-backed Shah was overthrown and the Ayatollah Khomeini was -- had just returned from exile became head of the new Islamic Republic. But the anniversary comes amid skyrocketing tensions with the U.S. now. Some fear war between the two adversaries could be on the horizon.</p><p>Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen joining us from the Iranian capital. And is this an anniversary being celebrated across Iran, Fred?</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly is among the folks in the government, Becky, and there certainly are going to be big celebrations on this date tomorrow. And if you look at Iran today you can really see how important this date is for so many Iranians, not just the ones here because it changed the trajectory of so many lives here in Iran, but then of course also to the many Iranians who are forced to flee abroad after the Islamic Revolution.</p><p>And if we look at Iran today, Becky, you can see that Iran is politically and militarily probably more powerful than it ever has been since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in this region, but at the same time economically it certainly is struggling especially under sanctions coming from the United States. Let's have a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[10:20:41] PLEITGEN: The return from exile of Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1979 and the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah marked the culmination of the Islamic Revolution. Businessman Abdullah Hassan Chafee says he organized opposition groups in those days. 40 years later, he believes the revolution produced mixed results.</p><p>Religiously and ideologically the revolution achieved its goals, he says, but economically due to sanctions and domestic mismanagement, we've not yet reached those goals.</p><p>The Islamic Revolution also an uprising against America's support for the Shah. In late 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran capturing and holding hostage more than 50 Americans from within 400 days. U.S.-Iranian relations have never recovered. Hardliners still chanting death to America at Friday prayers even though Iran's supreme leader recently tried to tone down the rhetoric.</p><p>Let me make something clear for U.S. leaders, he said. Death to America means death to Trump, John Bolton and Pompeo. It means death to American rulers. We have no problems with the American people. The Trump White House is cracking down on Iran pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration and hitting the country with sanctions that are crippling its economy and causing its currency to plummet.</p><p>The U.S. says Iran is a threat to Israel and America's allies in the Middle East, and lashed out at Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran's answer, a defense Expo praising the rockets.</p><p>Iran shows no signs of bowing to American and international pressure. The country says it will continue to develop its ballistic missile program which it says is solely for defense purposes. For the first time Iran recently released video of one of its underground missile assembly facilities. 40 years after the beginning of the Islamic Revolution the confrontation between the U.S. and Iran continues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN: And those I would say, Becky, are the two main questions on the minds of many Iranians, not just the ones who are living in this country but also of course many around the world as well. On the one hand is what is going to happen with this conflict that they have with the United States. Could things get even worse especially right now with a Trump White House clamping down on Tehran.</p><p>And then the biggest question probably right now for folks here in this country is how are they going to deal with this dire economic situation. Of course we'll recall, the ones who've been here so many times since the nuclear agreement was signed in the nuclear agreement was discarded by the United States, there was a lot of hope. All that hope now at this point is gone and many Iranians are asking how this country can get out of that dire economic situation especially of course with the U.S. again applying that pressure. Becky?</p><p>ANDERSON: Sure. And Fred, when you speak to people on the streets of Tehran who may or may not have read the headlines that go in The Washington Post today Trump is moving as closer to war with Iran. Whether they've read those headlines or not on this the anniversary of the revolution, what is their sense about what the U.S. might do next?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, I think there's a lot of people who do fear that the confrontation especially between this Trump White House and then of course also, for instance, with national security adviser John Bolton also very much clamping down on Iran as well, is that there could be a bigger confrontation that might be looming especially if you look at right now towards the Iranian role in places like Syria.</p><p>Of course, where you have for instance, the Israelis bombarding Iranian positions. I think there are some who fear that something like this could spiral if cooler heads don't prevail. I think at this point in time that's not something that Tehran necessarily wants but of course there is always the potential for miscalculation.</p><p>But I think that if you speak to many people here in Iran, the big thing on their minds right now is this economic isolation, the economic problems, and how this country is going to get out of that. And right now, very difficult for people to find any sort of hope that things could change. There was of course that hope after the nuclear agreement went into place that foreign investment could come to this country, that there could be a jobs free in this country as well.</p><p>Right now there are a lot of Iranians who are very, very concerned about their own economic situation, how this government could possibly get them out of it and generally how the country could get out of it as well, Becky.</p><p>[10:25:13] ANDERSON: Sure, if 6:54 p.m. in Tehran in Iran. It is cracking on towards half-past seven here in the UAE. And let's stick in the region, head to somewhere Iran is closely linked to nearby Syria. ISIS militants fighting to hold the last area under their control. U.S.-backed forces launched a major operation on Saturday at a small town near the border with Iraq.</p><p>Now, at its peak, ISIS controlled large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Now the militant group has been pushed back. It only controls a few square kilometers near the Euphrates River. Ben Wedeman joining us now near the frontlines in eastern Syria, an extremely dangerous place. The talk is that the ISIS Caliphate is no more despite there being cells still active. You've been in region now on the ground for some days if not weeks, what do you understand to be the real story?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the real story is, Becky, that the ISIS holds a very tiny area in this town behind me, perhaps three square kilometers but it is putting up a fight. The final offensive to retake this town called Baghouz (INAUDIBLE) began at 6:00 p.m. local time yesterday. Overnight, there was almost constant coalition airstrikes. And into the day in fact, we woke up this morning at this location at 5:00 a.m. to hear some massive explosions as the day began with increased intensified air strikes.</p><p>But we understand from the Syrian democratic forces, the U.N. backed forces that are leading the push into this town, that they have managed to take some ground. They -- initially overnight there was very little resistance from ISIS, but as the day wore on, the going got much tougher. There have been casualties on the side of the SDF today. And despite the fact that the fighting is ranging -- raging, what we saw it on the bluff just to my right to the east is that there are still civilians trying to get out of the town.</p><p>We saw about eight making their way up the hillside but we understand that there are still many civilians left inside. Of course many of them it's believed are being simply held as human shields. Those who have the money we were told, if you pay $1,000 you can somehow manage to get out. But most people in there probably don't have that much money. But as far as the fighting goes, it's getting more intense and we understand that there's a network of trenches and tunnels inside as well which makes it all the more difficult to make any progress inside. Becky?</p><p>ANDERSON: And Ben, you're clearly keeping the lights down. You know, not in any way trying to advertise your presence where you are because this is -- this is a live situation. For those that you are talking about, for the residents who are stuck inside that town, what's their future looking like tonight?</p><p>WEDEMAN: Bleak to say the least, but certainly it really will all depend on the investigations into those who are coming out what they find. Now we were at one of the locations where the people leaving the town are processed and all adult males are questions. Questioned not by SDF intelligence personnel but also by Americans, British, and French personnel who are there as well.</p><p>All the -- we saw many men actually being held. Probably they will go to a special camp which we might call Guantanamo East as far as their faith is concerned. And others for instance we see -- I think you saw that report we did included Canadian women, they may also face some legal problems when they return home.</p><p>As far as is the local residents go -- and we understand that at the end of the day there weren't that many local residents left, that many of the inhabitants of this town behind me are actually families, relatives of ISIS members, they're going to have to deal with the fact that they have the stench of ISIS upon them whether they were supporters or sympathizers or not, so their future as I said, Becky, is bleak.</p><p>[10:30:05] ANDERSON: Ben Wedeman is in Eastern Syria for you this evening. Ben, thank you. We appreciate it. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, coming to you live from Dubai tonight. Coming out, from building our furniture to building our future. Artificial technologies, now very real indeed. We get more on the rise of the robots, up next.</p><p>ANDRESON: Right now, the future of technology could be summed up by two little letters. A.I. Standing, of course, for Artificial Intelligence. And whether it's this Jenga-playing robot recently unveiled at MIT or the technology that's powering our computers and smartphones, there is nothing artificial about the impact that A.I. is having. Something the UAE is particularly keen to harness.</p><p>Joining us is Casper Klynge, who is the Danish tech ambassador. In fact, the first tech ambassador anywhere in the world. And I've been listening to your podcast TechPlomacy Talk, which is actually fascinating. So, thank you for joining us.</p><p>CASPER KLYNGE, TECH AMBASSADOR OF DENMARK: Thank you for having me.</p><p>ANDERSON: We also joined by a very special guest tonight. Everybody meet the animal. He is really good at mapping. I am told he never gets bored and unlike the rest of us, doesn't need to take breaks or retire. Casper, is this a future of tech right here?</p><p>[10:34:59] KLYNGE: I don't know. I hope it's a little bit more pretty- looking has rolled out. But they're as fast and the simplest can do quite a lot of things that robots couldn't do a few years ago. So, perhaps it is.</p><p>ANDERSON: How important is technology? We're told that technology innovation, digital economies, e-government, that's the future. We keep hearing that's the future. Is it the now?</p><p>KLYNGE: Well, I think it is. I think it's also a bit of dancer than I am, by the way. I think it is, and of course, you're speaking to tech ambassador and I'm one of the reasons why Denmark decided to appoint a tech Ambassador was, you know, realizing that technology is going to transcend everything we do.</p><p>Also as governments, but also that the tech industry is getting a bigger role with huge influence in the 21st century. And we need to begin to relate to that also as governments. So, I think it is -- it's going to be central in the next decades.</p><p>ANDERSON: I just did a quick search for -- I'm sorry. I just did a quick search for artificial intelligence on Google. It's been a long day. And the amount of information I got was absolutely staggering. From military applications to banking, a study at the human genome to uses of personal assistant, it seems as though A.I. could impact almost every area of our lives.</p><p>We have asked this question before, I will ask it again. There are dangers, we know. How do we ensure A.I. is used responsibly?</p><p>KLYNGE: Well, I think one of the ways of doing that is by having discussions like we're having these days in Dubai. It's about making sure that everybody's takes responsibility and this is called the World Government Summit. And of course, governments have a key role to play also on the regulatory front.</p><p>But, of course, what I'm advocating and what Demark is proposing is that the industry also takes responsibility. This is not only about making sure that official intelligence will do good for humanity, better health care, better education, but also to make sure that the values we -- value that they are uphold, democracies human rights attachment.</p><p>ANDERSON: This point, you tweeted a response to the UAE's Cabinet Minister Mohammad Al Gergawi. He had said the most, and I quote him here. \"The most valuable commodity in the future will be imagination and ideas,\" good quote. You added, \"I hope he is right but let those ideas be based on democratic values, ethical standards, and a commitment to defend a rules- based international order. #TechPlomacy.\" Casper, can you elaborate on that literature?</p><p>KLYNGE: Well, you know, I've been in this job for 1 1/2 years. And never let a good crisis go to waste. Somebody said and I think what we've seen with massive scandals Cambridge Analytica, as several scandals in the last 10 months. I think that shows that technology and we firmly believe that is something which is going to transform the world in a very good way.</p><p>You know, empower people -- bring people to better opportunities. But there is a flip side of the corner, and that is we have to make sure that some of the technologies and the platforms that will develop in liberal democracies that, that technology is not turns -- turned against us.</p><p>So, it undermines democracies that undermines the rules-based international system. That those are important things especially for a small country like Denmark, for the European Union. But I would argue those are critical questions no matter where you live in 2019.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, you've been doing this job 18 months. Tell me best and worst case examples of where you have seen technology beginning to be embedded within our lives.</p><p>KLYNGE: You know, best example I think is on healthcare. You know, I live in Palo Alto and spend most of my time there. So, in Silicon Valley, I haven't met a big technology company yet who is not investing massively and artificial intelligence in healthcare. And I think that will bring better treatment for cancer, it will solve some of the big issues in healthcare.</p><p>I think a fantastic example of how artificial intelligence is going to go first on the other side, what I've been shocked up about and what I -- what I remain concerned about is what I would call sort of a lack of societal responsibility in the C-suite among some of the big technology companies.</p><p>And I think that's a democratic problem, and something we really need to address. This is an invitation for dialogue with the tech companies but it takes two to tango.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, Casper, if you were to sit down tonight with Mark Zuckerberg, what is it that you would tell him that he needs to do next?</p><p>KLYNGE: Well, I would tell him that governments rarely get it right. I mean, especially on technology that are moving at a fast pace. We're trailing behind, and I think in the digital age, that gap is going to expand. What I would tell? You know, Zuckerberg or some of his CEO fellows is that the take into suite cannot do it alone either.</p><p>They need governments, they need to have a conversation with us to make sure that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANDERSON: They don't think they do need governments, either it takes some possibly that --</p><p>KLYNGE: Well, some of them do. Other's less so. But I think, some of these scandals and some of the big challenges in the last couple of years have shown, you know, we do need a party where we work closer together and that's exactly what this tech do must initiative is about. And frankly speaking, what my job is about. That is to increase the dialogue, also critical dialogue where we bring to the table issues that we don't necessarily agree with but then we find mutual ways forward. And I think that is important.</p><p>We also have to remind ourselves that the big technology companies, especially the American, ones they sell products of liberal democracy is the values that we've been fighting for, for several centuries. We need to stick together or sometimes the political turmoil.</p><p>[10:40:01] ANDERSON: Does it worry you that some of the conversations that you have in Silicon Valley consider those that you're having conversations with? Consider what you've just talked about, you know, a rules-based or that -- you know, the values of liberal democracy that they're not interested?</p><p>KLYNGE: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON: And this is sort of an age-old -- sort of -- you know, the days of yours.</p><p>KLYNGE: I think, if you look at sort of the narratives on some of the big tech companies, of course, they've been saying, \"You know, we work for the greater cause of humanity, we are both governance, we're trying to connect people in a new different way, we do what governments cannot do any longer.</p><p>I think the honeymoon is over. I think many of them realize that, that is not necessarily the case. And if they indirectly, and I don't think they're evil people sitting in the managerial positions. But if they help undermine democracies, they provide platforms that meddles with elections. Well they are part of the problem, and they also need to take responsibility, and they need to work with government to fix those issues.</p><p>ANDERSON: Casper, pleasure and a delight. Thank you for coming in. And the viewers, if you will listen to podcast, do listen to TechPlomacy Talk. It's absolutely fascinating. (INAUDIBLE) I'm pleased I've met you, sir.</p><p>KLYNGE: Thank you so much, Becky. Thanks.</p><p>ANDERSON: Bye. Animal. Is that -- oh, hello. Just off to a quick break, we go from tech to Trump as the world feels the weight of Trumpenomics. We speak with renowned economists Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman. That is up next, do not go.</p><p>ANDERSON: You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson from the World Government Summit in Dubai this evening, one world leader who isn't here is U.S. President Donald Trump. He is certainly not around today. But his presence is being felt nonetheless, even as his ongoing trade war with China drags down global markets, Mr. Trump maintains that he's unlikely to meet with his Chinese counterpart before March.</p><p>Instead, he's been touting his economic prowess, telling the State of the Union that the U.S. is quote sole considered, at least, \"the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\"</p><p>I'm joined here by economist Paul Krugman, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008. Also an economist at the York Times and a best-selling author. Well, I listened to that State of the Union speech by the U.S. president and hearing that the U.S. was the hottest economy around. Slightly surprised me, sir. Your thoughts.</p><p>PAUL KRUGMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, GRADUATE CENTER OF THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK: Well, I mean, we do have full employment. Fuller than anyone really thought was possible. That's turned out to be a surprise and that's good. Definitely, the job market is looking pretty good.</p><p>Wage growth is really disappointing. So, the thing that we most lack in the U.S. is still not there. Investment is not responding to that tax cut. So, I mean, it certainly you wouldn't give the U.S. economy a B+ or any minus. But it's not -- it's not paradise.</p><p>[10:45:08] ANDERSON: We'll the acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, says we, and I quote, \"Absolutely, cannot rule out another government shutdown this week.\" That will hurt things?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, I mean that it's -- a sustained shutdown is really -- we keep on there's lots of ways we could have a recession. But that's a good way to do it that would pretty much that's -- at has -- it's hugely disruptive, it's not just the lost salaries, the lost incomes, it's the -- it's the business gets harder and harder to do.</p><p>I mean, we actually turns out -- you know, you need a government to function and you can -- you can close for a while, but we were really starting to feel the pain upon the prior shutdown, and if we go back in I think there'll be this huge sort of groan of disappointment that will start to show in the -- in GDP pretty soon.</p><p>ANDERSON: And this at a time when we know that there is such anxiety around the U.S.-China relationship at present. The IMF just some weeks ago at Davos, and predicting relatively gloomy outlook. I has to be said, and the -- and that trade war that potential trade war is one of the primary reasons for that. How long if at all is it going to take for the U.S. president and the Chinese leaders to sort this out?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, the trouble we have on the whole, the U.S. -- I mean, there's two issues on the two as China relationship. One, China has in some important ways been a bad after. Not the ways the Trump is after. It means, bilateral trade deficit is not the problem, intellectual property is. And the Chinese have shown very little willingness to really move on that front.</p><p>But the other problem is that Trump personally has an obsession with the bilateral deficit which you cannot eliminate. So, what this is a problem.</p><p>ANDERSON: Isn't the third issue that the Chinese economy is actually slowing down only significantly?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, yes. No, China --</p><p>ANDERSON: With full affect the world economy.</p><p>KRUGMAN: China is structurally has been -- you know, I've been on -- for years, I keep on saying this, Can I go on?\" And the Chinese major to keep it going, but they don't have enough consumption. They have too much investment, not enough consumption. They fundamentally need to have more domestic demand. They keep on not managing to do that and maybe, maybe that those chickens are coming at some appropriate Chinese metaphor. But something is going to -- is finally we may have finally hit the breaking point there.</p><p>ANDERSON: It's the year of the pig. I'm not quite sure how we would work that one (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, OK. Fine, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ANDERSON: But then, one and they since -- I get where you're going on this. Back to the U.S. president who is on our screens on the left-hand side. This is a recorded footage, of course, we are into the opening of a new government in the U.S. ACongress led by the Democrats. And at the beginning of what is clearly the campaign for 2020, and a presidential run.</p><p>Do you have remarked that you see no problem with more progressive candidates on the left for the Democrats? What you don't seem to be clear about is who you think might run if anybody against the U.S. president on the right?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, I mean -- within the Republican Party? I'll be surprised if someone is willing to -- is able even to do that. I mean, the trouble is that the Republican Party has -- is a parties are very different. The Republican Party is this monolithic thing.</p><p>Very difficult to challenge any president and despite everything the base loves Trump. And so, no I don't think -- I don't think there's going to be a serious internal (INAUDIBLE). What do I know? I know anything -- you know, know more than anyone else on that. But it's going to be interesting to see where the Democrats go.</p><p>ANDERSON: Oxfam recently came out with this remarkable observation. The top 26 billionaire's own $1.4 trillion, which is nearly as much as four billion other people. Those statistics are pretty worrying, aren't they?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON: Is growing inequality not just a political issue now, but also a security one, sir?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, I am not sure. I mean, security is not the way I would have put it. But it is a -- it's a societal issue. At some level to function, we need to have -- certainly, democratic societies need some sense that we're all living in the same universe. That we all have a stake in the society we live in. And this extreme inequality with a -- with a small number of people who are completely not in the same world that we are in.</p><p>The same reality is a problem and I think that it contributes as part of the erosion of democratic norms that is helping to make things so bad.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, we're here at the World Government Summit, much talk about tech and innovation around the sort of idea of e-government going forward. When you talk to delegates here and you hear those speaking panels like yourself, how does what you are hearing here about the future or how will it impact the bottom line, is it where four countries around the world?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, you know, I'm a contrarian here. I mean, clearly, there's all -- this wonderful stuff happening technology is always wonderful stuff happening in technology. Is it transformative in right now? And I always come back to the bottom line which is the productivity growth is actually low.</p><p>We are -- we've had less technological progress over the past 10 years, substantially less than we expected to have. You go back to where people in 2007 thought we would the now, we are not there now. And if we look at how much there's the -- you know, so, yes, machine learning is great. But is it -- is it the kind of A.I. that people were talking about is how the computer ready to talk to us, is kind that they're -- you know, just really -- none of that is happening.</p><p>So, in fact, we had this weird combination of enormous hype about technology and actually quite disappointing delivery.</p><p>[10:50:48] ANDERSON: We'll see, and things do get delivered a lot quicker today than they were being delivered back in 2007. The question is what?</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right. Now --</p><p>ANDERSON: OK, we'll be delivered. Thank you, sir.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Thank you. Take care.</p><p>ANDERSON: Always a pleasure. We'll be back to wrap up everything that we have heard for you and digest it all from this, the world government summit in Dubai. I'm Becky Anderson. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. Do stay with us for news.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, what a busy hour from A.I. and innovation to the world economy, to ideas that will shape our future. We have covered it all this hour here at the World Government Summit. Let's get some more perspective. Samuel Burke is with me to bring much of what he has heard here into focus. And if there is one word or one company name that you have heard on more people's lips here than any other, it is --</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Huawei.</p><p>ANDERSON: Why?</p><p>BURKE: Everybody has been talking about 5G for years. But now 5G is here. This is the year that is starting to be rolled out in cities across the United States, across the Middle East, and Asia. But all of the sudden, they've thrown a wrench into the game because most of these countries were using Huawei, and because of the trade war, and because of the security concerns that the U.S. and other Western countries say they have, all of the sudden, the company that may have been the leader in this, they're starting to have to pull it out of their systems.</p><p>But fascinatingly, every minister I've talked with here, every CEO, every telecoms executive has told me I don't see concerns with Huawei. Now, we know there are theoretical concerns, but they say, \"I've never seen anything. I use this with confidence.\" So, it's incredible what the West, the United States especially is saying. But, where we don't actually see any proof publicly.</p><p>ANDERSON: We've got a minute left in this show. For the benefit of our viewers who aren't as up to scratch on 5G in its infrastructure as you are just reminders. I know, here for example view is just in the UAE, 5G is expected to add something like a $273 billion to the economy in the next 10 years, so.</p><p>[10:55:10] BURKE: Consumers will like it because their phones will run a bit faster. You can watch Netflix on your mobile devices. But what it really means in the economic opportunity you're talking about is that everything will be able to communicate with each other.</p><p>Your self-driving car will speak to the stoplight that will tell you that a bus is coming. So there's an opportunity for these telecoms companies to make a lot of money and build new infrastructure where this is all embedded.</p><p>ANDERSON: And the U.S. argument against how Huawei at the moment is what?</p><p>BURKE: Is that there are security concerns that a Chinese company must be behold into China. And so, if we have it in all of our infrastructures if, at some point, they want to listen in or they want to take secrets, it would be through there.</p><p>Now, those concerns may be legitimate, but there are concerns. We haven't seen the proof publicly.</p><p>ANDERSON: Fascinating. Thank you. We've been talking about the clockwork of our world. And so let's end on a man who once calculated the clockwork of our universe. Isaac Newton, saying, \"To see further than others, you must stand on the shoulders of giants.\"</p><p>And so, we've summited the summit as it were taking a long forward look into our future and our world for you from this, a World Government Summit in Dubai. I'm Becky Anderson. That was CONNECT THE WORLD. Thank you so much for coming along with us for the ride. Same time tomorrow.

Well, today everything zips along at light speed, wars on laptops, diplomacy through technology.  And that is why we are here live the World Government Summit in Dubai to take you to the movers and shakers figuring out how to build a better future, our future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Becky Anderson and this is of course \"CONNECT THE WORLD.\"  Well, a high-tech higher stakes and big questions.  That's what it's all about here in Dubai where 4,000 politicians experts and thought leaders from 150 countries have gathered to accomplish one thing, to \"set the agenda for the next generation of government.\"  And if the conversation is anything to go by that, next generation is very high-tech, expect artificial intelligence, pipe loops and robots.  The stakes are even higher, climate change, global inequality, and the mental health of us, the citizens.</p><p>And there is one very big question, can government keep up?  Well, CNN's Richard Quest and John Defterios joining me with the big themes.  And that is a really good question.  When you come to an event like this, Richard, and you've been speaking to example -- for example to Christine Lagarde today from the IMF.  This is all about what governments can do for us next.  How can they keep up?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  And the interesting thing about this particular summit is I would say this year it's come of age.  This year that I've had a real feeling that the right people are here for the right reasons discussing the right issues.  I passed an A.I. forum and it was just fascinating.  Seven or eight different little booths going on at the same time packed with people.</p><p>And he message is simple -- and it was a similar one from Davos, by the way, as you would remember from there.  A.I. and the fourth Industrial Revolution is now here.  Government has to deal with it.  And then -- what I'm hearing here is it's the methods and the ways in which they do it.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Technology innovation, those are the sort of buzzwords here.  The politicians are here.  They are talking about these new digital economies and how we will be shaped by governments as it were going forward.  There are those some traditional conversations going on not least those about Brexit, about trade wars.  What have you heard?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Well, that's the dichotomy here.  They're looking to the future.  That's what it's supposed to be doing this world government summit, to hear from the brain trust the Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan right now is on the stage looking at the geopolitical mapping.  One of the key geopolitical issues clearly is Brexit today, not by accident.  The international trade secretary for the U.K. Liam Fox was here.  This is a trading nation.</p><p>It was -- in fact you're talking about the Silk Road, and the spice route, and the spices that were traded from here, he wants to come and say we're not insulated because of Brexit.  We're going to be more global afterwards.  That's not an easy sale but he has to basically make that pitch at the crossroads of east and west here in the UAE.</p><p>Now, his arguments there was just interesting after a lot of heat.  He's suggesting back to you that Europe is going to need to be more flexible.  The U.K. is a $2.5 trillion economy.  Germany is slowing down, China is slowing down and it's not about politics but about the economic future of Europe and that flexibility.  Let's take a listen to Liam first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM FOX, INTERNATIONAL TRADE SECRETARY, UNITED KINGDOM:  I think the whole question of Brexit is always really been about is this a political separation?  Are the priorities to the -- for the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and the purity of the European project or is it about prosperity, jobs, and trade?  And I think that the pendulum has tilted towards the latter in the last few months as the effect of the Chinese slowdown has brought a recognition that Europe, the European economy on both sides of the channel I can't take unwarranted disruption.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  So unwarranted obstruction here to trade.  That's Liam Fox's position.  By the way, this is the government summit where they hone in on their future trading partners.  But eight years ago before the WGS was founded, it was China, last year you know was India bringing a trading partners of $70 billion $100 billion for the UAE.  And now their focus is on the Horn of Africa, focusing on the very fast growth of Ethiopian.</p><p>And I think Liam Fox wanted to come and say we want to be part of it.  we're going to form new trade agreements but a horrible week in last two weeks in fact at the U.K.  You had Dyson moving its headquarters to Singapore with that announcement.  UBS moving funds from London as the Swiss Bank to Germany.  Nissan is saying it wasn't going to proceed with a diesel project here.</p><p>He was trying to shrug all those things off and I think almost trying to bury his head in the sand and saying we will be open.  We will be open, but the hard deadlines coming.</p><p>[10:05:33] ANDERSON:  Yes.  We had this at Davos as well didn't we?  The signs were up.  Britain is open for business.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  That was extraordinary.  He put an advertising on the hotel.</p><p>QUEST:  Great Britain on the Belvidere of all places.  Yes.  Free trade, Christine Lagarde, I was -- I was talking to about A.I., what it's going to mean fourth industrial and all that.  And I said you know, jobs that will be lost.  And she immediately slapped me down and she says, no, Richard you mean jobs that will be adjusted.  And what she's worried about interesting, fascinating, is she says that women will be most affected or at least stand to be more effective because those jobs that women do currently in the workforce because of the discrimination and precious.  They are the ones that will go.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So what's the upside?</p><p>QUEST:  The upside is that if we get it right.  It's an increase of wealth for the whole world.  The upside is you know, people having more and more interesting exciting, more and lives, meaningful lives is the relevant for.  The downside doesn't bear thinking about you know, none of us so for, obviously, we're around for the first industrial revolution.  Well, maybe.  But you know, if you look at -- think of Spinning Jennies and thereafter, and this is -- this will be bigger.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  What's extraordinary here, I think and you know this because we live here, they're embracing their futures so they're using the summit every year in advancing.  We've gone into the -- to the museum here of the future.  They're advancing the thought process and the technology 75 years out.  It's extraordinary.</p><p>ANDERSON:  A.I. --</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  And people do embrace it because it's --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And A.I. embedded across every --</p><p>QUEST:  They've got -- they've got the right people here.  Never mind the top liners or the headliners that you might see somewhere else, they've got a few of them.  But they've got the experts from MIT, they've got the science labs, they've got Silicon Valley.  They've actually got the people that understand.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And what I thought was really interesting, I'm about to show of our viewers an interview that I conducted earlier with the Estonian class.  So this is a small country of 1.6 million but a country that is something like third or fourth rated when it comes to encouraging a new tech in word generation, looking for research and development money in the world of innovation.</p><p>And one expert suggesting recently is countries like Estonia that are stealing and march on nonetheless than the U.S. when it comes to tech advances.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, Estonia and Latvia, you know, these -- they were the ones that embraced E-government.  And in fact the bottle that we see today, we go through the airports for example, you can use your identity card that we live here with without the password and sliders through the E-gate or E-government services online, the inspiration came from Estonia.  That's why you see the prime minister of Estonia --</p><p>QUEST:  (INAUDIBLE) cabinet meetings.  They all turn up to cabinet -- they all turn up to cabinet where --</p><p>ANDERSON:  We hope so.</p><p>QUEST:  Just like you, Becky --</p><p>ANDERSON:  We got (INAUDIBLE) working on the old paper.  It makes me feel confident and comfortable in my job.  Thank you guys.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  The two mega minds on CNN.  They break the news and break it all down for you.  Let's zip to the border then between Russia and the European Union.  That is where of course what we've just been talking about, Estonia lies, Europe's digital leader or should that be Estonia.  It's a small place but it's a big presence here at the summit in Dubai.</p><p>It's been building its tech creds in a big way.  It is as we have suggested an E-state where 99, it this 99 percent of public services are now available online and around the clock but can it take, provide stability in a continent shaken by Brexit?  Estonia's Prime Minister Juri Ratas join me earlier and I began by asking about the future of the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.  This is fascinating.  Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JURI RATAS, PRIME MINISTER, ESTONIA:  I think the Brexit for the broad sides are very negative.  What is today is important.  I think of course we must understand that 52 percent is the people from Britain -- from United Kingdom they said that they would like to see that U.K. is out of E.U.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Truth.</p><p>RATAS:  OK.  But actually we need after the 29th of March, we need very strategic and I would like to say very close relations between 27 and U.K.  That's true that we booked our proposal on the day of 25th of November last year and I couldn't see today any this kind of movement that we are opening this agreement project.</p><p>[10:10:13] ANDERSON:  So you see a no deal Brexit at this point do and you are concerned about that?</p><p>RATAS:  I see that 27 countries and I also see the Prime Minister May were both are working to have a deal.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is she being a stubborn woman?</p><p>RATAS:  I think that the no deal isn't the best for both sides.  I really hope and I really believe today that we could find the deal.  And it is important to both sides and I see every council meeting that all these 27 countries but also Prime Minister May, we are we are working to achieve this goal, to find this opportunity.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Tell me, behind the scenes, are European leaders still hoping for a second referendum?</p><p>RATAS:  I think some leaders or maybe majority of our my colleagues, we are hoping that this tour is little bit still open that we could see that European Union is going forward with 28 countries.  Maybe it's today more fairytale than this kind of true life but let's see.  How to say -- it isn't today our question, I mean, 27 country's question.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There are many Estonians in the U.K. what are your biggest concerns about a no deal post March the 29th for your own citizens?</p><p>RATAS:  In United Kingdom, we have about 10,000 or 15,000 Estonians.  The most important things are the citizen's rights and also the rights of the business.  I think that is the most important.  Also for this very important for Estonia is to keep these very strategic relations between U.K. and Estonia if we are talking to security and defense. and what is actually very good at under the NATO umbrella we are -- we are still together this 29 countries.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Let's talk about NATO very briefly.  You've said that you want better relations with Russia.  Do you still now even after election meddling in the U.S. and in the Ukraine -- I know that there are U.K. troops for example as part of the NATO mission in your country.  How concerned are you?</p><p>RATAS:  The first thing where we all need the answers is Minsk agreements.  Is what -- is the situation what the Russian Federation is doing today in Ukraine, the eastern part, in Crimea. We must just see some positive steps.  Of course I think all E.U. countries, we understand that we need the dialogue, but dialogue is I think possible.  After that we could see the positive solutions or good solution under the Minsk agreement.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So you want to see better relations with Russia is what you're telling me.</p><p>RATAS:  Like I said, the first that must be -- it's about -- fort the Baltic States and for Estonia, it is so important.  If we are talking to independence, if we are talking to freedom, if we are talking to territorial integrity and sovereignty, and of course we are supporting Ukraine 101 percent about that, and after that we could talk and other issues as well, but the first is Minsk agreement.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You have this E-residency idea for example.  You had to though suspend that program I know after a major security flaw one that you kept under wraps for a while.  Does it concern you that we live in a world of big data that can be so easily manipulated?</p><p>RATAS:  Like I said -- actually we need this kind of free movement of data.  If we -- if we need a better medicine, better than airfield, better education, better security, but at the same time maybe a little bit in front we need all different things what are under the security, these are the data security and all the cyber security.  We had very strong cyber-attacks during springtime 2007.  Of course, now we are much preparations.  We are much better know how and also --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And many people are involved in hacking around the world.</p><p>RATAS: -- not hacking, also more people are doing to cooperation in the world and also entirely know how the need to cyber-security center as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  The Prime Minister of Estonia there.  A very human guess you probably notice, and that is actually kind of important because soon up next, we will meet Anymals and take a look at this.  I promise you, it won't bite.  He's beside you.  Look how he looks at the world literally like this.  Thermal vision guys, thermal vision.  Super cool.  He is dancing for us at the moment which he reminds me of somebody else.  Look at that.</p><p>[10:15:13] QUEST:  I don't know what you're suggesting.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What's really important is that this is a government summer as we've been discussing but it's -- but it's Anymals like this that companies will be showing off an event like this because this is about the future, John.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  What he doing?  What's his capabilities is what I want to find out.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're going to find next.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  It's good to see.</p><p>QUEST:  This is extraordinary.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You're frightened.</p><p>QUEST:  No.  It's just I've seen robots but they're all sort of talking about -- but this is actually starting to get the dexterity and the maneuverability and I'm -- hello!</p><p>ANDERSON:  It waved for you.</p><p>QUEST:  It did.  Not the first one.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're going to take a very short break viewers.  Up next that and some other world news.  As Iran gears up to celebrate the anniversary of its Islamic Revolution, we are live in Tehran to take the temperature.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, we are connecting your world from here at the World Government Summit in Dubai and why these -- while sometimes these get-togethers like Davos where I was recently, you can feel like they're in a bubble of isolation.  That is far from the case of course.  That's why we are connecting the world so much in flux around the world.  Case in point of such changes is a time for celebration.</p><p>In Iran it seems as the country marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.  That is when the government of the U.S.-backed Shah was overthrown and the Ayatollah Khomeini was -- had just returned from exile became head of the new Islamic Republic.  But the anniversary comes amid skyrocketing tensions with the U.S. now.  Some fear war between the two adversaries could be on the horizon.</p><p>Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen joining us from the Iranian capital.  And is this an anniversary being celebrated across Iran, Fred?</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it certainly is among the folks in the government, Becky, and there certainly are going to be big celebrations on this date tomorrow.  And if you look at Iran today you can really see how important this date is for so many Iranians, not just the ones here because it changed the trajectory of so many lives here in Iran, but then of course also to the many Iranians who are forced to flee abroad after the Islamic Revolution.</p><p>And if we look at Iran today, Becky, you can see that Iran is politically and militarily probably more powerful than it ever has been since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in this region, but at the same time economically it certainly is struggling especially under sanctions coming from the United States.  Let's have a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[10:20:41] PLEITGEN:  The return from exile of Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1979 and the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah marked the culmination of the Islamic Revolution.  Businessman Abdullah Hassan Chafee says he organized opposition groups in those days.  40 years later, he believes the revolution produced mixed results.</p><p>Religiously and ideologically the revolution achieved its goals, he says, but economically due to sanctions and domestic mismanagement, we've not yet reached those goals.</p><p>The Islamic Revolution also an uprising against America's support for the Shah.  In late 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran capturing and holding hostage more than 50 Americans from within 400 days.  U.S.-Iranian relations have never recovered.  Hardliners still chanting death to America at Friday prayers even though Iran's supreme leader recently tried to tone down the rhetoric.</p><p>Let me make something clear for U.S. leaders, he said.  Death to America means death to Trump, John Bolton and Pompeo.  It means death to American rulers.  We have no problems with the American people.  The Trump White House is cracking down on Iran pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration and hitting the country with sanctions that are crippling its economy and causing its currency to plummet.</p><p>The U.S. says Iran is a threat to Israel and America's allies in the Middle East, and lashed out at Iran's ballistic missile program.  Iran's answer, a defense Expo praising the rockets.</p><p>Iran shows no signs of bowing to American and international pressure.  The country says it will continue to develop its ballistic missile program which it says is solely for defense purposes.  For the first time Iran recently released video of one of its underground missile assembly facilities.  40 years after the beginning of the Islamic Revolution the confrontation between the U.S. and Iran continues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN:  And those I would say, Becky, are the two main questions on the minds of many Iranians, not just the ones who are living in this country but also of course many around the world as well.  On the one hand is what is going to happen with this conflict that they have with the United States.  Could things get even worse especially right now with a Trump White House clamping down on Tehran.</p><p>And then the biggest question probably right now for folks here in this country is how are they going to deal with this dire economic situation.  Of course we'll recall, the ones who've been here so many times since the nuclear agreement was signed in the nuclear agreement was discarded by the United States, there was a lot of hope.  All that hope now at this point is gone and many Iranians are asking how this country can get out of that dire economic situation especially of course with the U.S. again applying that pressure.  Becky?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Sure.  And Fred, when you speak to people on the streets of Tehran who may or may not have read the headlines that go in The Washington Post today Trump is moving as closer to war with Iran.  Whether they've read those headlines or not on this the anniversary of the revolution, what is their sense about what the U.S. might do next?</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, I think there's a lot of people who do fear that the confrontation especially between this Trump White House and then of course also, for instance, with national security adviser John Bolton also very much clamping down on Iran as well, is that there could be a bigger confrontation that might be looming especially if you look at right now towards the Iranian role in places like Syria.</p><p>Of course, where you have for instance, the Israelis bombarding Iranian positions.  I think there are some who fear that something like this could spiral if cooler heads don't prevail.  I think at this point in time that's not something that Tehran necessarily wants but of course there is always the potential for miscalculation.</p><p>But I think that if you speak to many people here in Iran, the big thing on their minds right now is this economic isolation, the economic problems, and how this country is going to get out of that.  And right now, very difficult for people to find any sort of hope that things could change.  There was of course that hope after the nuclear agreement went into place that foreign investment could come to this country, that there could be a jobs free in this country as well.</p><p>Right now there are a lot of Iranians who are very, very concerned about their own economic situation, how this government could possibly get them out of it and generally how the country could get out of it as well, Becky.</p><p>[10:25:13] ANDERSON:  Sure, if 6:54 p.m. in Tehran in Iran.  It is cracking on towards half-past seven here in the UAE.  And let's stick in the region, head to somewhere Iran is closely linked to nearby Syria.  ISIS militants fighting to hold the last area under their control.  U.S.-backed forces launched a major operation on Saturday at a small town near the border with Iraq.</p><p>Now, at its peak, ISIS controlled large swaths of Iraq and Syria.  Now the militant group has been pushed back.  It only controls a few square kilometers near the Euphrates River.  Ben Wedeman joining us now near the frontlines in eastern Syria, an extremely dangerous place.  The talk is that the ISIS Caliphate is no more despite there being cells still active.  You've been in region now on the ground for some days if not weeks, what do you understand to be the real story?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the real story is, Becky, that the ISIS holds a very tiny area in this town behind me, perhaps three square kilometers but it is putting up a fight.  The final offensive to retake this town called Baghouz  (INAUDIBLE) began at 6:00 p.m. local time yesterday.  Overnight, there was almost constant coalition airstrikes.  And into the day in fact, we woke up this morning at this location at 5:00 a.m. to hear some massive explosions as the day began with increased intensified air strikes.</p><p>But we understand from the Syrian democratic forces, the U.N. backed forces that are leading the push into this town, that they have managed to take some ground.  They -- initially overnight there was very little resistance from ISIS, but as the day wore on, the going got much tougher.  There have been casualties on the side of the SDF today.  And despite the fact that the fighting is ranging -- raging, what we saw it on the bluff just to my right to the east is that there are still civilians trying to get out of the town.</p><p>We saw about eight making their way up the hillside but we understand that there are still many civilians left inside.  Of course many of them it's believed are being simply held as human shields.  Those who have the money we were told, if you pay $1,000 you can somehow manage to get out.  But most people in there probably don't have that much money.  But as far as the fighting goes, it's getting more intense and we understand that there's a network of trenches and tunnels inside as well which makes it all the more difficult to make any progress inside.  Becky?</p><p>ANDERSON:  And Ben, you're clearly keeping the lights down.  You know, not in any way trying to advertise your presence where you are because this is -- this is a live situation.  For those that you are talking about, for the residents who are stuck inside that town, what's their future looking like tonight?</p><p>WEDEMAN:  Bleak to say the least, but certainly it really will all depend on the investigations into those who are coming out what they find.  Now we were at one of the locations where the people leaving the town are processed and all adult males are questions.  Questioned not by SDF intelligence personnel but also by Americans, British, and French personnel who are there as well.</p><p>All the -- we saw many men actually being held.  Probably they will go to a special camp which we might call Guantanamo East as far as their faith is concerned.  And others for instance we see -- I think you saw that report we did included Canadian women, they may also face some legal problems when they return home.</p><p>As far as is the local residents go -- and we understand that at the end of the day there weren't thatmany local residents left, that many of the inhabitants of this town behind me are actually families, relatives of ISIS members, they're going to have to deal with the fact that they have the stench of ISIS upon them whether they were supporters or sympathizers or not, so their future as I said, Becky, is bleak.</p><p>[10:30:05] ANDERSON:  Ben Wedeman is in Eastern Syria for you this evening.  Ben, thank you.  We appreciate it.  You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, coming to you live from Dubai tonight.  Coming out, from building our furniture to building our future.  Artificial technologies, now very real indeed.  We get more on the rise of the robots, up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDRESON:  Right now, the future of technology could be summed up by two little letters.  A.I.  Standing, of course, for Artificial Intelligence.  And whether it's this Jenga-playing robot recently unveiled at MIT or the technology that's powering our computers and smartphones, there is nothing artificial about the impact that A.I. is having.  Something the UAE is particularly keen to harness.</p><p>Joining us is Casper Klynge, who is the Danish tech ambassador.  In fact, the first tech ambassador anywhere in the world.  And I've been listening to your podcast TechPlomacy Talk, which is actually fascinating.  So, thank you for joining us.</p><p>CASPER KLYNGE, TECH AMBASSADOR OF DENMARK:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We also joined by a very special guest tonight.  Everybody meet the animal.  He is really good at mapping.  I am told he never gets bored and unlike the rest of us, doesn't need to take breaks or retire.  Casper, is this a future of tech right here?</p><p>[10:34:59] KLYNGE:  I don't know.  I hope it's a little bit more pretty-looking has rolled out.  But they're as fast and the simplest can do quite a lot of things that robots couldn't do a few years ago.  So, perhaps it is.</p><p>ANDERSON:  How important is technology?  We're told that technology innovation, digital economies, e-government, that's the future.  We keep hearing that's the future.  Is it the now?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, I think it is.  I think it's also a bit of dancer than I am, by the way.  I think it is, and of course, you're speaking to tech ambassador and I'm one of the reasons why Denmark decided to appoint a tech Ambassador was, you know, realizing that technology is going to transcend everything we do.</p><p>Also as governments, but also that the tech industry is getting a bigger role with huge influence in the 21st century.  And we need to begin to relate to that also as governments.  So, I think it is -- it's going to be central in the next decades.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I just did a quick search for -- I'm sorry.  I just did a quick search for artificial intelligence on Google.  It's been a long day.  And the amount of information I got was absolutely staggering.  From military applications to banking, a study at the human genome to uses of personal assistant, it seems as though A.I. could impact almost every area of our lives.</p><p>We have asked this question before, I will ask it again.  There are dangers, we know.  How do we ensure A.I. is used responsibly?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, I think one of the ways of doing that is by having discussions like we're having these days in Dubai.  It's about making sure that everybody's takes responsibility and this is called the World Government Summit.  And of course, governments have a key role to play also on the regulatory front.</p><p>But, of course, what I'm advocating and what Demark is proposing is that the industry also takes responsibility.  This is not only about making sure that official intelligence will do good for humanity, better health care, better education, but also to make sure that the values we -- value that they are uphold, democracies human rights attachment.</p><p>ANDERSON:  This point, you tweeted a response to the UAE's Cabinet Minister Mohammad Al Gergawi.  He had said the most, and I quote him here.  \"The most valuable commodity in the future will be imagination and ideas,\" good quote.  You added, \"I hope he is right but let those ideas be based on democratic values, ethical standards, and a commitment to defend a rules-based international order.  #TechPlomacy.\"  Casper, can you elaborate on that literature?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, you know, I've been in this job for 1 1/2 years.  And never let a good crisis go to waste.  Somebody said and I think what we've seen with massive scandals Cambridge Analytica, as several scandals in the last 10 months.  I think that shows that technology and we firmly believe that is something which is going to transform the world in a very good way.</p><p>You know, empower people -- bring people to better opportunities.  But there is a flip side of the corner, and that is we have to make sure that some of the technologies and the platforms that will develop in liberal democracies that, that technology is not turns -- turned against us.</p><p>So, it undermines democracies that undermines the rules-based international system.  That those are important things especially for a small country like Denmark, for the European Union.  But I would argue those are critical questions no matter where you live in 2019.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, you've been doing this job 18 months.  Tell me best and worst case examples of where you have seen technology beginning to be embedded within our lives.</p><p>KLYNGE:  You know, best example I think is on healthcare.  You know, I live in Palo Alto and spend most of my time there.  So, in Silicon Valley, I haven't met a big technology company yet who is not investing massively and artificial intelligence in healthcare.  And I think that will bring better treatment for cancer, it will solve some of the big issues in healthcare.</p><p>I think a fantastic example of how artificial intelligence is going to go first on the other side, what I've been shocked up about and what I -- what I remain concerned about is what I would call sort of a lack of societal responsibility in the C-suite among some of the big technology companies.</p><p>And I think that's a democratic problem, and something we really need to address.  This is an invitation for dialogue with the tech companies but it takes two to tango.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, Casper, if you were to sit down tonight with Mark Zuckerberg, what is it that you would tell him that he needs to do next?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, I would tell him that governments rarely get it right.  I mean, especially on technology that are moving at a fast pace.  We're trailing behind, and I think in the digital age, that gap is going to expand.  What I would tell?  You know, Zuckerberg or some of his CEO fellows is that the take into suite cannot do it alone either.</p><p>They need governments, they need to have a conversation with us to make sure that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  They don't think they do need governments, either it takes some possibly that --</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, some of them do.  Other's less so.  But I think, some of these scandals and some of the big challenges in the last couple of years have shown, you know, we do need a party where we work closer together and that's exactly what this tech do must initiative is about.  And frankly speaking, what my job is about.  That is to increase the dialogue, also critical dialogue where we bring to the table issues that we don't necessarily agree with but then we find mutual ways forward.  And I think that is important.</p><p>We also have to remind ourselves that the big technology companies, especially the American, ones they sell products of liberal democracy is the values that we've been fighting for, for several centuries.  We need to stick together or sometimes the political turmoil.</p><p>[10:40:01] ANDERSON:  Does it worry you that some of the conversations that you have in Silicon Valley consider those that you're having conversations with?  Consider what you've just talked about, you know, a rules-based or that -- you know, the values of liberal democracy that they're not interested?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this is sort of an age-old -- sort of -- you know, the days of yours.</p><p>KLYNGE:  I think, if you look at sort of the narratives on some of the big tech companies, of course, they've been saying, \"You know, we work for the greater cause of humanity, we are both governance, we're trying to connect people in a new different way, we do what governments cannot do any longer.</p><p>I think the honeymoon is over.  I think many of them realize that, that is not necessarily the case.  And if they indirectly, and I don't think they're evil people sitting in the managerial positions.  But if they help undermine democracies, they provide platforms that meddles with elections.  Well they are part of the problem, and they also need to take responsibility, and they need to work with government to fix those issues.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Casper, pleasure and a delight.  Thank you for coming in.  And the viewers, if you will listen to podcast, do listen to TechPlomacy Talk.  It's absolutely fascinating.  (INAUDIBLE) I'm pleased I've met you, sir.</p><p>KLYNGE:  Thank you so much, Becky.  Thanks.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Bye.  Animal.  Is that -- oh, hello.  Just off to a quick break, we go from tech to Trump as the world feels the weight of Trumpenomics.  We speak with renowned economists Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman.  That is up next, do not go.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson from the World Government Summit in Dubai this evening, one world leader who isn't here is U.S. President Donald Trump.  He is certainly not around today.  But his presence is being felt nonetheless, even as his ongoing trade war with China drags down global markets, Mr. Trump maintains that he's unlikely to meet with his Chinese counterpart before March.</p><p>Instead, he's been touting his economic prowess, telling the State of the Union that the U.S. is quote sole considered, at least, \"the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\"</p><p>I'm joined here by economist Paul Krugman, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008.  Also an economist at the York Times and a best-selling author.  Well, I listened to that State of the Union speech by the U.S. president and hearing that the U.S. was the hottest economy around.  Slightly surprised me, sir.  Your thoughts.</p><p>PAUL KRUGMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, GRADUATE CENTER OF THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK:  Well, I mean, we do have full employment.  Fuller than anyone really thought was possible.  That's turned out to be a surprise and that's good.  Definitely, the job market is looking pretty good.</p><p>Wage growth is really disappointing.  So, the thing that we most lack in the U.S. is still not there.  Investment is not responding to that tax cut.  So, I mean, it certainly you wouldn't give the U.S. economy a B+ or any minus.  But it's not -- it's not paradise.</p><p>[10:45:08] ANDERSON:  We'll the acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, says we, and I quote, \"Absolutely, cannot rule out another government shutdown this week.\"  That will hurt things?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Yes, I mean that it's -- a sustained shutdown is really -- we keep on there's lots of ways we could have a recession.  But that's a good way to do it that would pretty much that's -- at has -- it's hugely disruptive, it's not just the lost salaries, the lost incomes, it's the -- it's the business gets harder and harder to do.</p><p>I mean, we actually turns out -- you know, you need a government to function and you can -- you can close for a while, but we were really starting to feel the pain upon the prior shutdown, and if we go back in I think there'll be this huge sort of groan of disappointment that will start to show in the -- in GDP pretty soon.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this at a time when we know that there is such anxiety around the U.S.-China relationship at present.  The IMF just some weeks ago at Davos, and predicting relatively gloomy outlook.  I has to be said, and the -- and that trade war that potential trade war is one of the primary reasons for that.  How long if at all is it going to take for the U.S. president and the Chinese leaders to sort this out?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Well, the trouble we have on the whole, the U.S. -- I mean, there's two issues on the two as China relationship.  One, China has in some important ways been a bad after.  Not the ways the Trump is after.  It means, bilateral trade deficit is not the problem, intellectual property is.  And the Chinese have shown very little willingness to really move on that front.</p><p>But the other problem is that Trump personally has an obsession with the bilateral deficit which you cannot eliminate.  So, what this is a problem.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Isn't the third issue that the Chinese economy is actually slowing down only significantly?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, yes.  No, China --</p><p>ANDERSON:  With full affect the world economy.</p><p>KRUGMAN:  China is structurally has been -- you know, I've been on -- for years, I keep on saying this, Can I go on?\"  And the Chinese major to keep it going, but they don't have enough consumption.  They have too much investment, not enough consumption.  They fundamentally need to have more domestic demand.  They keep on not managing to do that and maybe, maybe that those chickens are coming at some appropriate Chinese metaphor.  But something is going to -- is finally we may have finally hit the breaking point there.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's the year of the pig.  I'm not quite sure how we would work that one (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Yes, OK.  Fine, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ANDERSON:  But then, one and they since -- I get where you're going on this.  Back to the U.S. president who is on our screens on the left-hand side.  This is a recorded footage, of course, we are into the opening of a new government in the U.S.  A Congress led by the Democrats.  And at the beginning of what is clearly the campaign for 2020, and a presidential run.</p><p>Do you have remarked that you see no problem with more progressive candidates on the left for the Democrats?  What you don't seem to be clear about is who you think might run if anybody against the U.S. president on the right?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, I mean -- within the Republican Party?  I'll be surprised if someone is willing to -- is able even to do that.  I mean, the trouble is that the Republican Party has -- is a parties are very different.  The Republican Party is this monolithic thing.</p><p>Very difficult to challenge any president and despite everything the base loves Trump.  And so, no I don't think -- I don't think there's going to be a serious internal (INAUDIBLE).  What do I know?  I know anything -- you know, know more than anyone else on that.  But it's going to be interesting to see where the Democrats go.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Oxfam recently came out with this remarkable observation.  The top 26 billionaire's own $1.4 trillion, which is nearly as much as four billion other people.  Those statistics are pretty worrying, aren't they?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is growing inequality not just a political issue now, but also a security one, sir?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, I am not sure.  I mean, security is not the way I would have put it.  But it is a -- it's a societal issue.  At some level to function, we need to have -- certainly, democratic societies need some sense that we're all living in the same universe.  That we all have a stake in the society we live in.  And this extreme inequality with a -- with a small number of people who are completely not in the same world that we are in.</p><p>The same reality is a problem and I think that it contributes as part of the erosion of democratic norms that is helping to make things so bad.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, we're here at the World Government Summit, much talk about tech and innovation around the sort of idea of e-government going forward.  When you talk to delegates here and you hear those speaking panels like yourself, how does what you are hearing here about the future or how will it impact the bottom line, is it where four countries around the world?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, you know, I'm a contrarian here.  I mean, clearly, there's all -- this wonderful stuff happening technology is always wonderful stuff happening in technology.  Is it transformative in right now?  And I always come back to the bottom line which is the productivity growth is actually low.</p><p>We are -- we've had less technological progress over the past 10 years, substantially less than we expected to have.  You go back to where people in 2007 thought we would the now, we are not there now.  And if we look at how much there's the -- you know, so, yes, machine learning is great.  But is it -- is it the kind of A.I. that people were talking about is how the computer ready to talk to us, is kind that they're -- you know, just really -- none of that is happening.</p><p>So, in fact, we had this weird combination of enormous hype about technology and actually quite disappointing delivery.</p><p>[10:50:48] ANDERSON:  We'll see, and things do get delivered a lot quicker today than they were being delivered back in 2007.  The question is what?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  That's right.  Now --</p><p>ANDERSON:  OK, we'll be delivered.  Thank you, sir.</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Thank you.  Take care.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Always a pleasure.  We'll be back to wrap up everything that we have heard for you and digest it all from this, the world government summit in Dubai.  I'm Becky Anderson.  This is CONNECT THE WORLD.  Do stay with us for news.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, what a busy hour from A.I. and innovation to the world economy, to ideas that will shape our future.  We have covered it all this hour here at the World Government Summit.  Let's get some more perspective.  Samuel Burke is with me to bring much of what he has heard here into focus.  And if there is one word or one company name that you have heard on more people's lips here than any other, it is --</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Huawei.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Why?</p><p>BURKE:  Everybody has been talking about 5G for years.  But now 5G is here.  This is the year that is starting to be rolled out in cities across the United States, across the Middle East, and Asia.  But all of the sudden, they've thrown a wrench into the game because most of these countries were using Huawei, and because of the trade war, and because of the security concerns that the U.S. and other Western countries say they have, all of the sudden, the company that may have been the leader in this, they're starting to have to pull it out of their systems.</p><p>But fascinatingly, every minister I've talked with here, every CEO, every telecoms executive has told me I don't see concerns with Huawei.  Now, we know there are theoretical concerns, but they say, \"I've never seen anything.  I use this with confidence.\"  So, it's incredible what the West, the United States especially is saying.  But, where we don't actually see any proof publicly.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We've got a minute left in this show.  For the benefit of our viewers who aren't as up to scratch on 5G in its infrastructure as you are just reminders.  I know, here for example view is just in the UAE, 5G is expected to add something like a $273 billion to the economy in the next 10 years, so.</p><p>[10:55:10] BURKE:  Consumers will like it because their phones will run a bit faster.

Well, today everything zips along at light speed, wars on laptops, diplomacy through technology.  And that is why we are here live the World Government Summit in Dubai to take you to the movers and shakers figuring out how to build a better future, our future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Becky Anderson and this is of course \"CONNECT THE WORLD.\"  Well, a high-tech higher stakes and big questions.  That's what it's all about here in Dubai where 4,000 politicians experts and thought leaders from 150 countries have gathered to accomplish one thing, to \"set the agenda for the next generation of government.\"  And if the conversation is anything to go by that, next generation is very high-tech, expect artificial intelligence, pipe loops and robots.  The stakes are even higher, climate change, global inequality, and the mental health of us, the citizens.</p><p>And there is one very big question, can government keep up?  Well, CNN's Richard Quest and John Defterios joining me with the big themes.  And that is a really good question.  When you come to an event like this, Richard, and you've been speaking to example -- for example to Christine Lagarde today from the IMF.  This is all about what governments can do for us next.  How can they keep up?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  And the interesting thing about this particular summit is I would say this year it's come of age.  This year that I've had a real feeling that the right people are here for the right reasons discussing the right issues.  I passed an A.I. forum and it was just fascinating.  Seven or eight different little booths going on at the same time packed with people.</p><p>And he message is simple -- and it was a similar one from Davos, by the way, as you would remember from there.  A.I. and the fourth Industrial Revolution is now here.  Government has to deal with it.  And then -- what I'm hearing here is it's the methods and the ways in which they do it.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Technology innovation, those are the sort of buzzwords here.  The politicians are here.  They are talking about these new digital economies and how we will be shaped by governments as it were going forward.  There are those some traditional conversations going on not least those about Brexit, about trade wars.  What have you heard?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Well, that's the dichotomy here.  They're looking to the future.  That's what it's supposed to be doing this world government summit, to hear from the brain trust the Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan right now is on the stage looking at the geopolitical mapping.  One of the key geopolitical issues clearly is Brexit today, not by accident.  The international trade secretary for the U.K. Liam Fox was here.  This is a trading nation.</p><p>It was -- in fact you're talking about the Silk Road, and the spice route, and the spices that were traded from here, he wants to come and say we're not insulated because of Brexit.  We're going to be more global afterwards.  That's not an easy sale but he has to basically make that pitch at the crossroads of east and west here in the UAE.</p><p>Now, his arguments there was just interesting after a lot of heat.  He's suggesting back to you that Europe is going to need to be more flexible.  The U.K. is a $2.5 trillion economy.  Germany is slowing down, China is slowing down and it's not about politics but about the economic future of Europe and that flexibility.  Let's take a listen to Liam first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM FOX, INTERNATIONAL TRADE SECRETARY, UNITED KINGDOM:  I think the whole question of Brexit is always really been about is this a political separation?  Are the priorities to the -- for the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and the purity of the European project or is it about prosperity, jobs, and trade?  And I think that the pendulum has tilted towards the latter in the last few months as the effect of the Chinese slowdown has brought a recognition that Europe, the European economy on both sides of the channel I can't take unwarranted disruption.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  So unwarranted obstruction here to trade.  That's Liam Fox's position.  By the way, this is the government summit where they hone in on their future trading partners.  But eight years ago before the WGS was founded, it was China, last year you know was India bringing a trading partners of $70 billion $100 billion for the UAE.  And now their focus is on the Horn of Africa, focusing on the very fast growth of Ethiopian.</p><p>And I think Liam Fox wanted to come and say we want to be part of it.  we're going to form new trade agreements but a horrible week in last two weeks in fact at the U.K.  You had Dyson moving its headquarters to Singapore with that announcement.  UBS moving funds from London as the Swiss Bank to Germany.  Nissan is saying it wasn't going to proceed with a diesel project here.</p><p>He was trying to shrug all those things off and I think almost trying to bury his head in the sand and saying we will be open.  We will be open, but the hard deadlines coming.</p><p>[10:05:33] ANDERSON:  Yes.  We had this at Davos as well didn't we?  The signs were up.  Britain is open for business.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  That was extraordinary.  He put an advertising on the hotel.</p><p>QUEST:  Great Britain on the Belvidere of all places.  Yes.  Free trade, Christine Lagarde, I was -- I was talking to about A.I., what it's going to mean fourth industrial and all that.  And I said you know, jobs that will be lost.  And she immediately slapped me down and she says, no, Richard you mean jobs that will be adjusted.  And what she's worried about interesting, fascinating, is she says that women will be most affected or at least stand to be more effective because those jobs that women do currently in the workforce because of the discrimination and precious.  They are the ones that will go.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So what's the upside?</p><p>QUEST:  The upside is that if we get it right.  It's an increase of wealth for the whole world.  The upside is you know, people having more and more interesting exciting, more and lives, meaningful lives is the relevant for.  The downside doesn't bear thinking about you know, none of us so for, obviously, we're around for the first industrial revolution.  Well, maybe.  But you know, if you look at -- think of Spinning Jennies and thereafter, and this is -- this will be bigger.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  What's extraordinary here, I think and you know this because we live here, they're embracing their futures so they're using the summit every year in advancing.  We've gone into the -- to the museum here of the future.  They're advancing the thought process and the technology 75 years out.  It's extraordinary.</p><p>ANDERSON:  A.I. --</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  And people do embrace it because it's --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And A.I. embedded across every --</p><p>QUEST:  They've got -- they've got the right people here.  Never mind the top liners or the headliners that you might see somewhere else, they've got a few of them.  But they've got the experts from MIT, they've got the science labs, they've got Silicon Valley.  They've actually got the people that understand.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And what I thought was really interesting, I'm about to show of our viewers an interview that I conducted earlier with the Estonian class.  So this is a small country of 1.6 million but a country that is something like third or fourth rated when it comes to encouraging a new tech in word generation, looking for research and development money in the world of innovation.</p><p>And one expert suggesting recently is countries like Estonia that are stealing and march on nonetheless than the U.S. when it comes to tech advances.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, Estonia and Latvia, you know, these -- they were the ones that embraced E-government.  And in fact the bottle that we see today, we go through the airports for example, you can use your identity card that we live here with without the password and sliders through the E-gate or E-government services online, the inspiration came from Estonia.  That's why you see the prime minister of Estonia --</p><p>QUEST:  (INAUDIBLE) cabinet meetings.  They all turn up to cabinet -- they all turn up to cabinet where --</p><p>ANDERSON:  We hope so.</p><p>QUEST:  Just like you, Becky --</p><p>ANDERSON:  We got (INAUDIBLE) working on the old paper.  It makes me feel confident and comfortable in my job.  Thank you guys.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  The two mega minds on CNN.  They break the news and break it all down for you.  Let's zip to the border then between Russia and the European Union.  That is where of course what we've just been talking about, Estonia lies, Europe's digital leader or should that be Estonia.  It's a small place but it's a big presence here at the summit in Dubai.</p><p>It's been building its tech creds in a big way.  It is as we have suggested an E-state where 99, it this 99 percent of public services are now available online and around the clock but can it take, provide stability in a continent shaken by Brexit?  Estonia's Prime Minister Juri Ratas join me earlier and I began by asking about the future of the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.  This is fascinating.  Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JURI RATAS, PRIME MINISTER, ESTONIA:  I think the Brexit for the broad sides are very negative.  What is today is important.  I think of course we must understand that 52 percent is the people from Britain -- from United Kingdom they said that they would like to see that U.K. is out of E.U.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Truth.</p><p>RATAS:  OK.  But actually we need after the 29th of March, we need very strategic and I would like to say very close relations between 27 and U.K.  That's true that we booked our proposal on the day of 25th of November last year and I couldn't see today any this kind of movement that we are opening this agreement project.</p><p>[10:10:13] ANDERSON:  So you see a no deal Brexit at this point do and you are concerned about that?</p><p>RATAS:  I see that 27 countries and I also see the Prime Minister May were both are working to have a deal.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is she being a stubborn woman?</p><p>RATAS:  I think that the no deal isn't the best for both sides.  I really hope and I really believe today that we could find the deal.  And it is important to both sides and I see every council meeting that all these 27 countries but also Prime Minister May, we are we are working to achieve this goal, to find this opportunity.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Tell me, behind the scenes, are European leaders still hoping for a second referendum?</p><p>RATAS:  I think some leaders or maybe majority of our my colleagues, we are hoping that this tour is little bit still open that we could see that European Union is going forward with 28 countries.  Maybe it's today more fairytale than this kind of true life but let's see.  How to say -- it isn't today our question, I mean, 27 country's question.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There are many Estonians in the U.K. what are your biggest concerns about a no deal post March the 29th for your own citizens?</p><p>RATAS:  In United Kingdom, we have about 10,000 or 15,000 Estonians.  The most important things are the citizen's rights and also the rights of the business.  I think that is the most important.  Also for this very important for Estonia is to keep these very strategic relations between U.K. and Estonia if we are talking to security and defense. and what is actually very good at under the NATO umbrella we are -- we are still together this 29 countries.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Let's talk about NATO very briefly.  You've said that you want better relations with Russia.  Do you still now even after election meddling in the U.S. and in the Ukraine -- I know that there are U.K. troops for example as part of the NATO mission in your country.  How concerned are you?</p><p>RATAS:  The first thing where we all need the answers is Minsk agreements.  Is what -- is the situation what the Russian Federation is doing today in Ukraine, the eastern part, in Crimea. We must just see some positive steps.  Of course I think all E.U. countries, we understand that we need the dialogue, but dialogue is I think possible.  After that we could see the positive solutions or good solution under the Minsk agreement.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So you want to see better relations with Russia is what you're telling me.</p><p>RATAS:  Like I said, the first that must be -- it's about -- fort the Baltic States and for Estonia, it is so important.  If we are talking to independence, if we are talking to freedom, if we are talking to territorial integrity and sovereignty, and of course we are supporting Ukraine 101 percent about that, and after that we could talk and other issues as well, but the first is Minsk agreement.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You have this E-residency idea for example.  You had to though suspend that program I know after a major security flaw one that you kept under wraps for a while.  Does it concern you that we live in a world of big data that can be so easily manipulated?</p><p>RATAS:  Like I said -- actually we need this kind of free movement of data.  If we -- if we need a better medicine, better than airfield, better education, better security, but at the same time maybe a little bit in front we need all different things what are under the security, these are the data security and all the cyber security.  We had very strong cyber-attacks during springtime 2007.  Of course, now we are much preparations.  We are much better know how and also --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And many people are involved in hacking around the world.</p><p>RATAS: -- not hacking, also more people are doing to cooperation in the world and also entirely know how the need to cyber-security center as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  The Prime Minister of Estonia there.  A very human guess you probably notice, and that is actually kind of important because soon up next, we will meet Anymals and take a look at this.  I promise you, it won't bite.  He's beside you.  Look how he looks at the world literally like this.  Thermal vision guys, thermal vision.  Super cool.  He is dancing for us at the moment which he reminds me of somebody else.  Look at that.</p><p>[10:15:13] QUEST:  I don't know what you're suggesting.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What's really important is that this is a government summer as we've been discussing but it's -- but it's Anymals like this that companies will be showing off an event like this because this is about the future, John.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  What he doing?  What's his capabilities is what I want to find out.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're going to find next.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  It's good to see.</p><p>QUEST:  This is extraordinary.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You're frightened.</p><p>QUEST:  No.  It's just I've seen robots but they're all sort of talking about -- but this is actually starting to get the dexterity and the maneuverability and I'm -- hello!</p><p>ANDERSON:  It waved for you.</p><p>QUEST:  It did.  Not the first one.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're going to take a very short break viewers.  Up next that and some other world news.  As Iran gears up to celebrate the anniversary of its Islamic Revolution, we are live in Tehran to take the temperature.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, we are connecting your world from here at the World Government Summit in Dubai and why these -- while sometimes these get-togethers like Davos where I was recently, you can feel like they're in a bubble of isolation.  That is far from the case of course.  That's why we are connecting the world so much in flux around the world.  Case in point of such changes is a time for celebration.</p><p>In Iran it seems as the country marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.  That is when the government of the U.S.-backed Shah was overthrown and the Ayatollah Khomeini was -- had just returned from exile became head of the new Islamic Republic.  But the anniversary comes amid skyrocketing tensions with the U.S. now.  Some fear war between the two adversaries could be on the horizon.</p><p>Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen joining us from the Iranian capital.  And is this an anniversary being celebrated across Iran, Fred?</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it certainly is among the folks in the government, Becky, and there certainly are going to be big celebrations on this date tomorrow.  And if you look at Iran today you can really see how important this date is for so many Iranians, not just the ones here because it changed the trajectory of so many lives here in Iran, but then of course also to the many Iranians who are forced to flee abroad after the Islamic Revolution.</p><p>And if we look at Iran today, Becky, you can see that Iran is politically and militarily probably more powerful than it ever has been since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in this region, but at the same time economically it certainly is struggling especially under sanctions coming from the United States.  Let's have a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[10:20:41] PLEITGEN:  The return from exile of Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1979 and the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah marked the culmination of the Islamic Revolution.  Businessman Abdullah Hassan Chafee says he organized opposition groups in those days.  40 years later, he believes the revolution produced mixed results.</p><p>Religiously and ideologically the revolution achieved its goals, he says, but economically due to sanctions and domestic mismanagement, we've not yet reached those goals.</p><p>The Islamic Revolution also an uprising against America's support for the Shah.  In late 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran capturing and holding hostage more than 50 Americans from within 400 days.  U.S.-Iranian relations have never recovered.  Hardliners still chanting death to America at Friday prayers even though Iran's supreme leader recently tried to tone down the rhetoric.</p><p>Let me make something clear for U.S. leaders, he said.  Death to America means death to Trump, John Bolton and Pompeo.  It means death to American rulers.  We have no problems with the American people.  The Trump White House is cracking down on Iran pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration and hitting the country with sanctions that are crippling its economy and causing its currency to plummet.</p><p>The U.S. says Iran is a threat to Israel and America's allies in the Middle East, and lashed out at Iran's ballistic missile program.  Iran's answer, a defense Expo praising the rockets.</p><p>Iran shows no signs of bowing to American and international pressure.  The country says it will continue to develop its ballistic missile program which it says is solely for defense purposes.  For the first time Iran recently released video of one of its underground missile assembly facilities.  40 years after the beginning of the Islamic Revolution the confrontation between the U.S. and Iran continues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN:  And those I would say, Becky, are the two main questions on the minds of many Iranians, not just the ones who are living in this country but also of course many around the world as well.  On the one hand is what is going to happen with this conflict that they have with the United States.  Could things get even worse especially right now with a Trump White House clamping down on Tehran.</p><p>And then the biggest question probably right now for folks here in this country is how are they going to deal with this dire economic situation.  Of course we'll recall, the ones who've been here so many times since the nuclear agreement was signed in the nuclear agreement was discarded by the United States, there was a lot of hope.  All that hope now at this point is gone and many Iranians are asking how this country can get out of that dire economic situation especially of course with the U.S. again applying that pressure.  Becky?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Sure.  And Fred, when you speak to people on the streets of Tehran who may or may not have read the headlines that go in The Washington Post today Trump is moving as closer to war with Iran.  Whether they've read those headlines or not on this the anniversary of the revolution, what is their sense about what the U.S. might do next?</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, I think there's a lot of people who do fear that the confrontation especially between this Trump White House and then of course also, for instance, with national security adviser John Bolton also very much clamping down on Iran as well, is that there could be a bigger confrontation that might be looming especially if you look at right now towards the Iranian role in places like Syria.</p><p>Of course, where you have for instance, the Israelis bombarding Iranian positions.  I think there are some who fear that something like this could spiral if cooler heads don't prevail.  I think at this point in time that's not something that Tehran necessarily wants but of course there is always the potential for miscalculation.</p><p>But I think that if you speak to many people here in Iran, the big thing on their minds right now is this economic isolation, the economic problems, and how this country is going to get out of that.  And right now, very difficult for people to find any sort of hope that things could change.  There was of course that hope after the nuclear agreement went into place that foreign investment could come to this country, that there could be a jobs free in this country as well.</p><p>Right now there are a lot of Iranians who are very, very concerned about their own economic situation, how this government could possibly get them out of it and generally how the country could get out of it as well, Becky.</p><p>[10:25:13] ANDERSON:  Sure, if 6:54 p.m. in Tehran in Iran.  It is cracking on towards half-past seven here in the UAE.  And let's stick in the region, head to somewhere Iran is closely linked to nearby Syria.  ISIS militants fighting to hold the last area under their control.  U.S.-backed forces launched a major operation on Saturday at a small town near the border with Iraq.</p><p>Now, at its peak, ISIS controlled large swaths of Iraq and Syria.  Now the militant group has been pushed back.  It only controls a few square kilometers near the Euphrates River.  Ben Wedeman joining us now near the frontlines in eastern Syria, an extremely dangerous place.  The talk is that the ISIS Caliphate is no more despite there being cells still active.  You've been in region now on the ground for some days if not weeks, what do you understand to be the real story?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the real story is, Becky, that the ISIS holds a very tiny area in this town behind me, perhaps three square kilometers but it is putting up a fight.  The final offensive to retake this town called Baghouz  (INAUDIBLE) began at 6:00 p.m. local time yesterday.  Overnight, there was almost constant coalition airstrikes.  And into the day in fact, we woke up this morning at this location at 5:00 a.m. to hear some massive explosions as the day began with increased intensified air strikes.</p><p>But we understand from the Syrian democratic forces, the U.N. backed forces that are leading the push into this town, that they have managed to take some ground.  They -- initially overnight there was very little resistance from ISIS, but as the day wore on, the going got much tougher.  There have been casualties on the side of the SDF today.  And despite the fact that the fighting is ranging -- raging, what we saw it on the bluff just to my right to the east is that there are still civilians trying to get out of the town.</p><p>We saw about eight making their way up the hillside but we understand that there are still many civilians left inside.  Of course many of them it's believed are being simply held as human shields.  Those who have the money we were told, if you pay $1,000 you can somehow manage to get out.  But most people in there probably don't have that much money.  But as far as the fighting goes, it's getting more intense and we understand that there's a network of trenches and tunnels inside as well which makes it all the more difficult to make any progress inside.  Becky?</p><p>ANDERSON:  And Ben, you're clearly keeping the lights down.  You know, not in any way trying to advertise your presence where you are because this is -- this is a live situation.  For those that you are talking about, for the residents who are stuck inside that town, what's their future looking like tonight?</p><p>WEDEMAN:  Bleak to say the least, but certainly it really will all depend on the investigations into those who are coming out what they find.  Now we were at one of the locations where the people leaving the town are processed and all adult males are questions.  Questioned not by SDF intelligence personnel but also by Americans, British, and French personnel who are there as well.</p><p>All the -- we saw many men actually being held.  Probably they will go to a special camp which we might call Guantanamo East as far as their faith is concerned.  And others for instance we see -- I think you saw that report we did included Canadian women, they may also face some legal problems when they return home.</p><p>As far as is the local residents go -- and we understand that at the end of the day there weren't thatmany local residents left, that many of the inhabitants of this town behind me are actually families, relatives of ISIS members, they're going to have to deal with the fact that they have the stench of ISIS upon them whether they were supporters or sympathizers or not, so their future as I said, Becky, is bleak.</p><p>[10:30:05] ANDERSON:  Ben Wedeman is in Eastern Syria for you this evening.  Ben, thank you.  We appreciate it.  You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, coming to you live from Dubai tonight.  Coming out, from building our furniture to building our future.  Artificial technologies, now very real indeed.  We get more on the rise of the robots, up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDRESON:  Right now, the future of technology could be summed up by two little letters.  A.I.  Standing, of course, for Artificial Intelligence.  And whether it's this Jenga-playing robot recently unveiled at MIT or the technology that's powering our computers and smartphones, there is nothing artificial about the impact that A.I. is having.  Something the UAE is particularly keen to harness.</p><p>Joining us is Casper Klynge, who is the Danish tech ambassador.  In fact, the first tech ambassador anywhere in the world.  And I've been listening to your podcast TechPlomacy Talk, which is actually fascinating.  So, thank you for joining us.</p><p>CASPER KLYNGE, TECH AMBASSADOR OF DENMARK:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We also joined by a very special guest tonight.  Everybody meet the animal.  He is really good at mapping.  I am told he never gets bored and unlike the rest of us, doesn't need to take breaks or retire.  Casper, is this a future of tech right here?</p><p>[10:34:59] KLYNGE:  I don't know.  I hope it's a little bit more pretty-looking has rolled out.  But they're as fast and the simplest can do quite a lot of things that robots couldn't do a few years ago.  So, perhaps it is.</p><p>ANDERSON:  How important is technology?  We're told that technology innovation, digital economies, e-government, that's the future.  We keep hearing that's the future.  Is it the now?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, I think it is.  I think it's also a bit of dancer than I am, by the way.  I think it is, and of course, you're speaking to tech ambassador and I'm one of the reasons why Denmark decided to appoint a tech Ambassador was, you know, realizing that technology is going to transcend everything we do.</p><p>Also as governments, but also that the tech industry is getting a bigger role with huge influence in the 21st century.  And we need to begin to relate to that also as governments.  So, I think it is -- it's going to be central in the next decades.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I just did a quick search for -- I'm sorry.  I just did a quick search for artificial intelligence on Google.  It's been a long day.  And the amount of information I got was absolutely staggering.  From military applications to banking, a study at the human genome to uses of personal assistant, it seems as though A.I. could impact almost every area of our lives.</p><p>We have asked this question before, I will ask it again.  There are dangers, we know.  How do we ensure A.I. is used responsibly?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, I think one of the ways of doing that is by having discussions like we're having these days in Dubai.  It's about making sure that everybody's takes responsibility and this is called the World Government Summit.  And of course, governments have a key role to play also on the regulatory front.</p><p>But, of course, what I'm advocating and what Demark is proposing is that the industry also takes responsibility.  This is not only about making sure that official intelligence will do good for humanity, better health care, better education, but also to make sure that the values we -- value that they are uphold, democracies human rights attachment.</p><p>ANDERSON:  This point, you tweeted a response to the UAE's Cabinet Minister Mohammad Al Gergawi.  He had said the most, and I quote him here.  \"The most valuable commodity in the future will be imagination and ideas,\" good quote.  You added, \"I hope he is right but let those ideas be based on democratic values, ethical standards, and a commitment to defend a rules-based international order.  #TechPlomacy.\"  Casper, can you elaborate on that literature?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, you know, I've been in this job for 1 1/2 years.  And never let a good crisis go to waste.  Somebody said and I think what we've seen with massive scandals Cambridge Analytica, as several scandals in the last 10 months.  I think that shows that technology and we firmly believe that is something which is going to transform the world in a very good way.</p><p>You know, empower people -- bring people to better opportunities.  But there is a flip side of the corner, and that is we have to make sure that some of the technologies and the platforms that will develop in liberal democracies that, that technology is not turns -- turned against us.</p><p>So, it undermines democracies that undermines the rules-based international system.  That those are important things especially for a small country like Denmark, for the European Union.  But I would argue those are critical questions no matter where you live in 2019.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, you've been doing this job 18 months.  Tell me best and worst case examples of where you have seen technology beginning to be embedded within our lives.</p><p>KLYNGE:  You know, best example I think is on healthcare.  You know, I live in Palo Alto and spend most of my time there.  So, in Silicon Valley, I haven't met a big technology company yet who is not investing massively and artificial intelligence in healthcare.  And I think that will bring better treatment for cancer, it will solve some of the big issues in healthcare.</p><p>I think a fantastic example of how artificial intelligence is going to go first on the other side, what I've been shocked up about and what I -- what I remain concerned about is what I would call sort of a lack of societal responsibility in the C-suite among some of the big technology companies.</p><p>And I think that's a democratic problem, and something we really need to address.  This is an invitation for dialogue with the tech companies but it takes two to tango.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, Casper, if you were to sit down tonight with Mark Zuckerberg, what is it that you would tell him that he needs to do next?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, I would tell him that governments rarely get it right.  I mean, especially on technology that are moving at a fast pace.  We're trailing behind, and I think in the digital age, that gap is going to expand.  What I would tell?  You know, Zuckerberg or some of his CEO fellows is that the take into suite cannot do it alone either.</p><p>They need governments, they need to have a conversation with us to make sure that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  They don't think they do need governments, either it takes some possibly that --</p><p>KLYNGE:  Well, some of them do.  Other's less so.  But I think, some of these scandals and some of the big challenges in the last couple of years have shown, you know, we do need a party where we work closer together and that's exactly what this tech do must initiative is about.  And frankly speaking, what my job is about.  That is to increase the dialogue, also critical dialogue where we bring to the table issues that we don't necessarily agree with but then we find mutual ways forward.  And I think that is important.</p><p>We also have to remind ourselves that the big technology companies, especially the American, ones they sell products of liberal democracy is the values that we've been fighting for, for several centuries.  We need to stick together or sometimes the political turmoil.</p><p>[10:40:01] ANDERSON:  Does it worry you that some of the conversations that you have in Silicon Valley consider those that you're having conversations with?  Consider what you've just talked about, you know, a rules-based or that -- you know, the values of liberal democracy that they're not interested?</p><p>KLYNGE:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this is sort of an age-old -- sort of -- you know, the days of yours.</p><p>KLYNGE:  I think, if you look at sort of the narratives on some of the big tech companies, of course, they've been saying, \"You know, we work for the greater cause of humanity, we are both governance, we're trying to connect people in a new different way, we do what governments cannot do any longer.</p><p>I think the honeymoon is over.  I think many of them realize that, that is not necessarily the case.  And if they indirectly, and I don't think they're evil people sitting in the managerial positions.  But if they help undermine democracies, they provide platforms that meddles with elections.  Well they are part of the problem, and they also need to take responsibility, and they need to work with government to fix those issues.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Casper, pleasure and a delight.  Thank you for coming in.  And the viewers, if you will listen to podcast, do listen to TechPlomacy Talk.  It's absolutely fascinating.  (INAUDIBLE) I'm pleased I've met you, sir.</p><p>KLYNGE:  Thank you so much, Becky.  Thanks.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Bye.  Animal.  Is that -- oh, hello.  Just off to a quick break, we go from tech to Trump as the world feels the weight of Trumpenomics.  We speak with renowned economists Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman.  That is up next, do not go.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson from the World Government Summit in Dubai this evening, one world leader who isn't here is U.S. President Donald Trump.  He is certainly not around today.  But his presence is being felt nonetheless, even as his ongoing trade war with China drags down global markets, Mr. Trump maintains that he's unlikely to meet with his Chinese counterpart before March.</p><p>Instead, he's been touting his economic prowess, telling the State of the Union that the U.S. is quote sole considered, at least, \"the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\"</p><p>I'm joined here by economist Paul Krugman, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008.  Also an economist at the York Times and a best-selling author.  Well, I listened to that State of the Union speech by the U.S. president and hearing that the U.S. was the hottest economy around.  Slightly surprised me, sir.  Your thoughts.</p><p>PAUL KRUGMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, GRADUATE CENTER OF THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK:  Well, I mean, we do have full employment.  Fuller than anyone really thought was possible.  That's turned out to be a surprise and that's good.  Definitely, the job market is looking pretty good.</p><p>Wage growth is really disappointing.  So, the thing that we most lack in the U.S. is still not there.  Investment is not responding to that tax cut.  So, I mean, it certainly you wouldn't give the U.S. economy a B+ or any minus.  But it's not -- it's not paradise.</p><p>[10:45:08] ANDERSON:  We'll the acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, says we, and I quote, \"Absolutely, cannot rule out another government shutdown this week.\"  That will hurt things?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Yes, I mean that it's -- a sustained shutdown is really -- we keep on there's lots of ways we could have a recession.  But that's a good way to do it that would pretty much that's -- at has -- it's hugely disruptive, it's not just the lost salaries, the lost incomes, it's the -- it's the business gets harder and harder to do.</p><p>I mean, we actually turns out -- you know, you need a government to function and you can -- you can close for a while, but we were really starting to feel the pain upon the prior shutdown, and if we go back in I think there'll be this huge sort of groan of disappointment that will start to show in the -- in GDP pretty soon.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this at a time when we know that there is such anxiety around the U.S.-China relationship at present.  The IMF just some weeks ago at Davos, and predicting relatively gloomy outlook.  I has to be said, and the -- and that trade war that potential trade war is one of the primary reasons for that.  How long if at all is it going to take for the U.S. president and the Chinese leaders to sort this out?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Well, the trouble we have on the whole, the U.S. -- I mean, there's two issues on the two as China relationship.  One, China has in some important ways been a bad after.  Not the ways the Trump is after.  It means, bilateral trade deficit is not the problem, intellectual property is.  And the Chinese have shown very little willingness to really move on that front.</p><p>But the other problem is that Trump personally has an obsession with the bilateral deficit which you cannot eliminate.  So, what this is a problem.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Isn't the third issue that the Chinese economy is actually slowing down only significantly?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, yes.  No, China --</p><p>ANDERSON:  With full affect the world economy.</p><p>KRUGMAN:  China is structurally has been -- you know, I've been on -- for years, I keep on saying this, Can I go on?\"  And the Chinese major to keep it going, but they don't have enough consumption.  They have too much investment, not enough consumption.  They fundamentally need to have more domestic demand.  They keep on not managing to do that and maybe, maybe that those chickens are coming at some appropriate Chinese metaphor.  But something is going to -- is finally we may have finally hit the breaking point there.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's the year of the pig.  I'm not quite sure how we would work that one (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Yes, OK.  Fine, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ANDERSON:  But then, one and they since -- I get where you're going on this.  Back to the U.S. president who is on our screens on the left-hand side.  This is a recorded footage, of course, we are into the opening of a new government in the U.S.  A Congress led by the Democrats.  And at the beginning of what is clearly the campaign for 2020, and a presidential run.</p><p>Do you have remarked that you see no problem with more progressive candidates on the left for the Democrats?  What you don't seem to be clear about is who you think might run if anybody against the U.S. president on the right?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, I mean -- within the Republican Party?  I'll be surprised if someone is willing to -- is able even to do that.  I mean, the trouble is that the Republican Party has -- is a parties are very different.  The Republican Party is this monolithic thing.</p><p>Very difficult to challenge any president and despite everything the base loves Trump.  And so, no I don't think -- I don't think there's going to be a serious internal (INAUDIBLE).  What do I know?  I know anything -- you know, know more than anyone else on that.  But it's going to be interesting to see where the Democrats go.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Oxfam recently came out with this remarkable observation.  The top 26 billionaire's own $1.4 trillion, which is nearly as much as four billion other people.  Those statistics are pretty worrying, aren't they?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is growing inequality not just a political issue now, but also a security one, sir?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, I am not sure.  I mean, security is not the way I would have put it.  But it is a -- it's a societal issue.  At some level to function, we need to have -- certainly, democratic societies need some sense that we're all living in the same universe.  That we all have a stake in the society we live in.  And this extreme inequality with a -- with a small number of people who are completely not in the same world that we are in.</p><p>The same reality is a problem and I think that it contributes as part of the erosion of democratic norms that is helping to make things so bad.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, we're here at the World Government Summit, much talk about tech and innovation around the sort of idea of e-government going forward.  When you talk to delegates here and you hear those speaking panels like yourself, how does what you are hearing here about the future or how will it impact the bottom line, is it where four countries around the world?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Oh, you know, I'm a contrarian here.  I mean, clearly, there's all -- this wonderful stuff happening technology is always wonderful stuff happening in technology.  Is it transformative in right now?  And I always come back to the bottom line which is the productivity growth is actually low.</p><p>We are -- we've had less technological progress over the past 10 years, substantially less than we expected to have.  You go back to where people in 2007 thought we would the now, we are not there now.  And if we look at how much there's the -- you know, so, yes, machine learning is great.  But is it -- is it the kind of A.I. that people were talking about is how the computer ready to talk to us, is kind that they're -- you know, just really -- none of that is happening.</p><p>So, in fact, we had this weird combination of enormous hype about technology and actually quite disappointing delivery.</p><p>[10:50:48] ANDERSON:  We'll see, and things do get delivered a lot quicker today than they were being delivered back in 2007.  The question is what?</p><p>KRUGMAN:  That's right.  Now --</p><p>ANDERSON:  OK, we'll be delivered.  Thank you, sir.</p><p>KRUGMAN:  Thank you.  Take care.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Always a pleasure.  We'll be back to wrap up everything that we have heard for you and digest it all from this, the world government summit in Dubai.  I'm Becky Anderson.  This is CONNECT THE WORLD.  Do stay with us for news.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, what a busy hour from A.I. and innovation to the world economy, to ideas that will shape our future.  We have covered it all this hour here at the World Government Summit.  Let's get some more perspective.  Samuel Burke is with me to bring much of what he has heard here into focus.  And if there is one word or one company name that you have heard on more people's lips here than any other, it is --</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Huawei.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Why?</p><p>BURKE:  Everybody has been talking about 5G for years.  But now 5G is here.  This is the year that is starting to be rolled out in cities across the United States, across the Middle East, and Asia.  But all of the sudden, they've thrown a wrench into the game because most of these countries were using Huawei, and because of the trade war, and because of the security concerns that the U.S. and other Western countries say they have, all of the sudden, the company that may have been the leader in this, they're starting to have to pull it out of their systems.</p><p>But fascinatingly, every minister I've talked with here, every CEO, every telecoms executive has told me I don't see concerns with Huawei.  Now, we know there are theoretical concerns, but they say, \"I've never seen anything.  I use this with confidence.\"  So, it's incredible what the West, the United States especially is saying.  But, where we don't actually see any proof publicly.</p><p>ANDERSON:  We've got a minute left in this show.  For the benefit of our viewers who aren't as up to scratch on 5G in its infrastructure as you are just reminders.  I know, here for example view is just in the UAE, 5G is expected to add something like a $273 billion to the economy in the next 10 years, so.</p><p>[10:55:10] BURKE:  Consumers will like it because their phones will run a bit faster.  You can watch Netflix on your mobile devices.  But what it really means in the economic opportunity you're talking about is that everything will be able to communicate with each other.</p><p>Your self-driving car will speak to the stoplight that will tell you that a bus is coming.  So there's an opportunity for these telecoms companies to make a lot of money and build new infrastructure where this is all embedded.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And the U.S. argument against how Huawei at the moment is what?</p><p>BURKE:  Is that there are security concerns that a Chinese company must be behold into China.  And so, if we have it in all of our infrastructures if, at some point, they want to listen in or they want to take secrets, it would be through there.</p><p>Now, those concerns may be legitimate, but there are concerns.  We haven't seen the proof publicly.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Fascinating.  Thank you.  We've been talking about the clockwork of our world.  And so let's end on a man who once calculated the clockwork of our universe.  Isaac Newton, saying, \"To see further than others, you must stand on the shoulders of giants.\"</p><p>And so, we've summited the summit as it were taking a long forward look into our future and our world for you from this, a World Government Summit in Dubai.  I'm Becky Anderson.  That was CONNECT THE WORLD.  Thank you so much for coming along with us for the ride.  Same time tomorrow.  Bye-bye.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2178246254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPN-2J21-DY0W-40DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

Congress is back in session this week, and it's up to serious mischief in the arenas of privacy, innovation and corporate accounting. In each case, powerful interests are backing bad legislation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Here's a rundown, in order of the most immediate threats:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> First -- In one of the most dishonestly named bills of all time, the House recently passed the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2004. The legislation would, in fact, open the floodgates for these intrusions into our lives.</p><p>The bill, S2603, would allow anyone who's done any kind of business with you in the last seven years -- seven years! -- to send you faxes without getting your permission first. You would have to opt out each time.</p><p> The FCC's latest regulations, which proposed to tighten the current rules against junk faxes, were too much for corporate America and its marketing wizards who continue to invade every corner of our lives. Their power with Congress is far greater than yours, so far.</p><p> At least they could tell the truth, naming S2603 the \"Junk Fax Enabling Act.\"</p><p> Second -- There's surprising, but unfortunate, movement in the entertainment industry's most desired legislation, also known as the \"Induce Act.\" In the name of halting copyright infringement, it would threaten all kinds of technological innovation.</p><p> The tech industry, after snoozing at first, did finally start complaining about S2560. The bill was drawing bipartisan support, mostly from lawmakers who are taking megabucks in campaign contributions from Hollywood and its friends.</p><p> The aim of the bill is mainly to kill off peer-to-peer technology the copyright industry doesn't control. That's bad enough, given that there are entirely legitimate reasons for using such services -- which might well be outlawed in the process. But the legislation could be used to threaten or kill some useful technologies.</p><p> After Internet service providers and some big tech companies objected, the chief sponsor, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, challenged the opponents to come up with a better bill.</p><p> The opponents did just that, writing a draft that would target big-time commercial piracy while protecting innocent people and useful technology. Of course, they were immediately rebuffed by the copyright lobby. I'm sorry to say the co-sponsors include Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. She should know better.</p><p> Third -- Even as it moves to pass other ill-considered legislation, the Senate is considering whether to back the House's passage of a bill on stock options. This one also deserves to expire.</p><p> The legislation, S1890, would prevent regulators from requiring companies to account more accurately for the cost of stock options on their balance sheets. Currently, most companies hide the cost in footnotes rather than listing them as expenses.</p><p> Listing the cost of options as expenses would not change the actual financial condition of any company. It would, however, reduce reported earnings in many cases.</p><p> For that reason, many in Silicon Valley furiously oppose the change, saying it will introduce new uncertainties in understanding a company's books. As I've noted before, the Valley approach seems to be that investors are smart enough today to figure out what's going on, but will suddenly become too stupid to understand if we move to a system that notes the very real cost to shareholders of options grants.</p><p> There will be moves to attach the House bill to legislation in the Senate. Two powerful Republican senators, Richard Shelby of Alabama and Ted Stephens of Alaska, have indicated their opposition to mucking with the work of accounting rule-makers.</p><p> And William Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, also has asked the Senate to butt out of this dispute. It should take his advice.</p><p>Please pick up the phone. Call 1-202-224-3121 and ask for your U.S. senators. Their direct lines can be found on the Senate's Web site (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.senate.gov\">www.senate.gov</url>). Add your voice on the issues. You can make a difference.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-0409080340</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4D91-7CS0-0094-508K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 P.G.

The work, which won a Fringe First award in Edinburgh last year, explores a young woman's troubles with unfiltered honesty. \"When I put mustard all over my body, the audience are always so horrified,\" O'Connor says, adding that \"the freedom you feel by doing something a bit weird on stage\" is what she missed during lockdown. \"Even if you had really solid mental health going into the pandemic, it's really hard to find someone who hasn't been negatively affected.\"</p><p>Originally themed </p><p>                   Utopias and Uprisings                   </p><p>, this year's festival now delves into darker issues about mental health and Orwellian state control. Coburn Gray was commissioned to create </p><p>                   Before You Say Anything                   </p><p> after shows were cancelled because of Covid regulations. One of only five live theatrical productions - down from the usual 50 or so - his production at Dublin Castle bucks the trend for monologues by using a cast of three. Using harrowing stories from the past, it explores public health and public order via nudity.</p><p>\"Care can quickly turn into violence - and that's topical, both in an illness-lockdown sense and a global moment around policing,\" says Coburn Gray. \"We hope no one who comes to our show goes away thinking, 'Oh yeah, I shouldn't wear a mask,' but we don't think they will.\"</p><p>                   Initiation                   </p><p>, Matthew Bratko and Frank Sweeney's zany online play, is pure Big Brother. The premise is that each audience member joins a live Zoom meeting and is given dares. They start off tame - eg \"take a shot\" - but get darker as sado-masochism and the occult invade the trippy space. \"There's nothing dangerous involved,\" Bratko insists, \"but we want you to feel like you're in danger without any actual danger.\" Beware: if you fail to do the dare, there will be consequences. \"The audience are watching each other and we're watching you do the dare, so if you don't do it . . . you get kicked out,\" says the New Yorker, who voices the show live from the US.</p><p>Even our drag queens seem ruffled by the perilous undertones of the new normal. Patrick Scullion, aka Rosa Tralee, examines social media and questions its innocence in her comedy </p><p>                   Youse: Biz From the Age of Surveillance C*pitalism                   </p><p>, loosely based on Shoshana Zuboff's book. \"How we talk about big tech and how we talk about Ireland . . . requires a certain amount of draggy thinking,\" she insists.</p><p>Writer-actor Caitr\u00edona N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa was once an on-screen, in-vision RTE continuity announcer, and her grandfather was a lighthouse keeper. Both roles have now been usurped by machinery. </p><p>                   Transmission                   </p><p>, her multi-media, one woman-show at the Peacock, relates what happens when she finds archive material about her long-dead grandfather online. With lives on pause and work practices changing, this exploration of time should capture the zeitgeist.</p><p>Fishamble's Duets co-productions are usually a Fringe mainstay, but this year there will be only one: </p><p>                   Twenty Fifty                   </p><p>, by Dan Colley and Fionnuala Gygax. It is another online interactive show, and promises a different guest collaborator with each performance.</p><p>An Post might reap further financial benefits from the social-distancing rules as </p><p>                   A Rain Walk                   </p><p> and </p><p>                   1000 Miniature Meadows                   </p><p> involve getting instructions by post when you book tickets. In the former, you wait for a rainy day before completing the task - shouldn't take long. In the latter, we are encouraged to step into a garden and listen to a soundscape, which includes a \"conversation\" with bumblebees.</p><p>Other highlights include online interviews with \"difficult\" women over 70. It features Lelia Doolan, Bernadette McAliskey and Dervla Murphy. Broadcast at </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rte.ie/culture/\">rte.ie/culture</url></p><p> in four parts, its premiere is on September 15.</p><p>So, at least until September 20, it's business close to usual for Dublin theatre. As McGowan remarked: \"It's an industry [with] thousands of highly skilled people who want the same opportunity that others have been afforded: which is to adapt for the times and get back to work.</p><p>                   fringefest.com                   fringefest.com                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-65747963</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S9-TXY1-JCJY-G0T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 6, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

Good morning  to you.  Thank you so much.  Happy Monday.  We'll see you in a little bit,  girls.  Thank you.  It is Monday, October 27th -- October 22nd.  Good  morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher.  Here are your top stories.  6:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting for gains, futures indicating the markets this morning will open  fractionally better on the session.  Dow Industrials up 25, NASDAQ up 31  right now, half a percent higher.</p><p>This after a mixed story on Wall Street on Friday.  The market snapped a  two-day losing streak, posting a slight gain on the session with the Dow  Industrials up 65 points, quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  weaker on Friday at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are edging higher, take a look.  FT-100 up  a half percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of a percent, 40 points higher. </p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board at the close.  And as you see,  the Shanghai Composite, the best performer out of China, up better than  four percent on the session.</p><p>Stocks in china soaring.  The government revealing tax changes to help  support the slowing economy.  And with that, a multi-move across the board,  and the averages, best in four years.</p><p>Investors bracing for the busiest week of earnings season so far.  Ten Dow  Components due to report their third quarter earnings, plus technology  giants Amazon and Alphabet on deck this week.</p><p>On Friday, we get the first look at third quarter GDP.  That could be a  market mover.  We'll break it all down and we got all the preview on  earnings as well.</p><p>Another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says that  he wants to get something done before November eight days from now, what  that means ahead of the midterm elections this morning.</p><p>And upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is headed to  Saudi Arabia today, amid pressure to take action against the Kingdom after  it admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham telling me on Sunday Morning Futures he felt used by  the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he's open to keeping the arms  seal -- sales deal on track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it impossible to believe  that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So, go after him and his inner  circle, save they alliance.</p><p>I don't mind military sales, but I cannot do business with the current  leadership.  MBS, he's done to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus, caravan crisis, thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into Mexico  with their sights on the U.S.A.  We're going to take you live to the border  to get an update on that caravan this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and Independent Women's Voice CEO,  Heather Higgins, is here this morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Thank you </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS:  It's going to be a  hectic week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hectic week because of earnings, hectic week because of?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  GDP out on Friday.  We find out how fast this country was  growing in the third quarter and if we need more tax cuts, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  President said that on the campaigns trial on  Saturday, but it's also a huge week for earnings.  We've got technology in  the spotlight, Amazon and Alphabet may very well move markets.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, big time.  Especially because I'm looking forward to Verizon  tomorrow because they're going to talk about their 5G rollout.  They did it  in four different cities.  So, that's the way with the future.  </p><p>We'll see how much capital they need to put into that.  That's part of the  Infrastructure Bill.  Remember the President keeps talking about  infrastructure?  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, 5G is part of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The GDP number on Friday, Dagen, I guess the, you know, Atlanta  Fed was all the way up at, what, four -- better than 4.5 percent, 4.8  percent or so?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we now on that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the Wall Street Journal, in its estimate, so it was 4.2  percent in the second quarter, but the third quarter is expected to come in  at 3.4 percent in the preliminary reading.  A wide -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still a good number.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A widening trade gap could be a drag on third quarter GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Based on the Journal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  So good backdrop, Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It is now.  And they're -- the administration's really happy with  anything over three percent just because we --- they keep saying --  everybody said even three percent was impossible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  We're so happy to have anything over three percent.  That is  great.  And so -- but they're looking at these four percent plus numbers  and they're thrilled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you get the biggest week of third quarter earnings so far.   That's going to also show you some real growth.  That means like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent company, Alphabet, all setting to report along  with 10 Dow Components.</p><p>On the economic side, the highlight of the week, of course, is that GDP  report.  And in terms of what we're going to see in terms of market  expectations.  Pretty much baked in a better than three percent number?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think it is.  One of the things that has weighed on  economists has been the tariffs, and so that's why the look-through into  tech earnings this week is, what have the implications been.  </p><p>Especially when you think about Apple, they come out next week.  They  haven't updated the guidance, but they said the tariffs are a tax on  consumers.  So, how is that going to impact their phone sales, especially  because they came out with new releases?  </p><p>I think it's interesting to note that technology stocks are only valued  seven percent higher than the general market.  The market's trading about  15.9 times earnings, tech's around 16.6, but they have twice the profit  margins.</p><p>So, let's see what the guidance is coming forward.  So you saw Goldman  Sachs even came out earlier this week.  I mean, last week.</p><p>They were talking about how tech isn't overvalued and that this the selloff  has been unwarranted, but it's important to note that investors have been  rotating into safer names.</p><p>They don't think we're going to get 10, 20, 30 percent returns going  forward.  They went into consumer staples stocks.  Consumer staples stocks  are up 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Technology stocks are down 3.5 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to also watch out for, the Wall Street Journal writes  about this in today's paper.  Slowing sales growth.</p><p>So instead of earnings, because, again, if sales growth slows -- and we  have had, according to the Journal, 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies  have reported so far.  Based on our estimates, it's actually 38 percent,  miss-sales forecasts.</p><p>If sustained, that quarterly sales miss-ratio would mark the highest so far  this year.  So again, if you're coming up short on sales for whatever  reason, whether it's higher prices that you -- you're not -- that you're  trying to pass on and people aren't buying it, whatever the reason, that  doesn't bode well for earnings growth into next year.  </p><p>And sales are only growing, are expected to grow 7.3 percent, which is  slightly lower than expectations going into this quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the guidance is going to be reflecting what the  expectations are on the trade situation, right?  On tariffs.</p><p>Because if we start -- this is when we're going to know.  I mean, companies  should probably guide us toward us, \"All right, we're going to see lower  sales than expected because of the tariffs.\"</p><p>I don't know that's the case, but I would imagine this is the quarter when  we find out if, in fact, it is going to weigh on earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the most important thing that the market's going to  focus is operating margins.  They think margins are going to come down and  be compressed because several factors.  Some of them are the rising input  costs, now we're seeing inflation's going up.  </p><p>We're also seeing labor costs are going up, costs of goods are going up.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So the problem is this, how are they going to be able to maintain  that, if they're not able to get more productivity out of their workers?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  If you can pass on these higher costs, which like with  Unilever, some of the big consumer products companies, then that's good  news. The -- </p><p>I mean not ultimately to the customer, but it's good news for the companies  again, but it's -- again, the higher input costs, you can't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  For whatever reason, it's not just tariffs.  Watch a lot of  companies potentially, if they're coming up short, start to blame tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're going to have to kind of comb through the -- try and  separate the fact from the fiction.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It'll be -- </p><p>KELLY:  Also the storm, they'll see that in -- about the storms, right?  So  we -- they'll think next quarter's going to be weak because of the storms,  whatever's happening.</p><p>We've seen -- Home Depot should be strong, but they actually got a  downgrade last week because they think the consumer's not going to be as  strong in upgrading their homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, whatever weakness we see, the President's trying to  offset it now with talk of more tax cuts ahead of the election. </p><p>He spoke to reporters just this weekend about a package that they're  working on right now.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be sometime, just prior I would say to November.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, Election Day is 15 days away at this point, November  1st.  Ten days away.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He didn't say which November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, of course, you know, Congress is out of session until  after the November Elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe he comes out with an announcement before midterm  elections, but we're not going to see a vote, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  And quite frankly, the deficit is becoming -- it's starting  to become an issue for politicians and for the American people.</p><p>President Trump said \"I'm ordering all my cabinet secretaries to cut their  spending by 5 percent.  But discretionary spending is what one-third --  roughly one-third of the entire budget every year.  And if you cut out  defense, it's a cut -- I think it represents less than one percent of  overall spending.</p><p>So again, I don't -- he -- it would take -- it's a long road to plow in  terms of pushing through a tax cut at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we know they want to make the individual cut permanent and  we know that that's going to be on their agenda should they have the  opportunity, even after the midterm elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe it --I mean he said Kevin Brady is working on it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  House, Ways and Means.  So maybe it's an announcement from  House, Ways and Means before the midterms.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It could be.  They won't get anything passed.  But it's been  pretty clear that even though they passed the first tax cut, that even  though they were constrained by certain prior agreements to have the  individual cuts be temporary, the goal was always to make those be  permanent.</p><p>You are now seeing a recovery which, for the first time in a very long  time, is being led by blue-collar job growth, blue-collar wages, small  business confidence, rather than leading from the top.</p><p>It's sort of from the bottom.  And those people are going to be going into  the midterms looking at this fantastically booming economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Trump's approval ratings are now higher than Obama's were going  into his first midterms.  And his disapproval ratings have actually come  down, layering on a promised middle-class tax cuts can't hurt.</p><p>And -- because serious way, if you want to take on the deficit, and this  may be the one President who can cut through the swamp and actually get  this done, because the creatures on both sides of the aisle like the  current services baseline, economic gains that would never, ever be allowed  in the private sector in terms of automatic budget increases and claiming.  </p><p>Because, you know, they get to claim to these two different constituents  coming into their office and for the exact same thing, they get to claim  that they were either cutting it or increasing it because of the semantics  involved with the built-in increases.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  If you're serious about taking on the deficit, then have you to  be serious on taking on the financial accounting games that are played in  Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's Saudi Arabia on deck as well.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin now defending his decision to go to Saudi.  He's meeting  with Saudi officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p>He says the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at this critical moment.   He's not going to that conference, but this trip comes after Saudi Arabia  said that Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was in fact killed  in a fist fight inside the Istanbul Consulate.</p><p>The Kingdom is forcefully denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  Lawmakers, though, are showing  skepticism on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Did the Crown Prince know anything  about it?  If there were people closely tied to him involved in this  operation?</p><p>ADEL BIN AHMED AL-JUBEIR, DIPLOMAT, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:   There weren't people closely tied to him who were involved in this  operation.  This was an operation that was a rogue operation. </p><p>This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities  and responsibilities they had.</p><p>GRAHAM:  it's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to  kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it.  That would  be brazen abuse of authority.</p><p>He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in  Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will quote the Wall Street Journal editorial today on this  very issue.  Saudi Arabia needs to step up.  We still don't know -- they  haven't produced Khashoggi's body, provided more details of precisely how  or when he decide.</p><p>The story doesn't add up.  Of the 18 people arrested, five others sacked,  several a part of Mohammed bin Salman the inner circle.  It's unlikely they  would have acted alone without at least, you know, feeling a tacit assent  from the Crown Prince.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial goes on to write, \"The U.S. goal should  be to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear that  murdering journalists is unacceptable and that Mohammed bin Salman's  erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral  relationship.\"</p><p>We can't dictate what King Salman will do about who should run Saudi  Arabia, but you can -- but Mohammed bin Salman also can't be allowed to  conclude that America thinks this is no big deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they've got to do something.  The U.S. has to do  something to push back in the face of this heinous situation.</p><p>Question is, does Mohammed bin Salman survive?  He's got two other sons.   There are a lot of people who want this guy out at this point.  Lindsey  Graham included.</p><p>So big question here, you know, I mean, the arms sales is going -- it's  going to go through.  The relationship is going to go through because  there's one big black eye here that we're faced with and that is Iran, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the muddled response from this administration and the uneven  response that we've seen since this all began, we need to be on very firm  footing about the message, like Lindsey Graham said that we send to King  Salman about who we -- who should run the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  I want to disagree.  I think that the administration has been  taking a difficult situation.  These are people that behaved really badly,  like so many of the people we've had to deal with.  And they've got this  challenge of how do you negotiate making them pay for it, making them fess  up to it, but not having them lose so much for -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But comparing it to Brett Kavanaugh was a misstep.  I'm sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, it's shifting gears for FiatChrysler.  Details on the  automaker's roughly $7 billion car parts deal.  That's next.  </p><p>And then a spooky box office debut, we've got it here on Halloween.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Battle at the border for sure, a migrant caravan  moving toward the United States.  It has grown now to roughly 5,000 people.   Griff Jenkins is live in McAllen, Texas this morning with details there,  right in the middle of it.  Griff.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  When the  caravan gets to this border, if they do indeed come here, they're going to  find an overwhelmed border already with illegal crossing.  </p><p>And the Rio Grande Valley Sector where I'm standing McAllen is the busiest  sector of the entire U.S. border, and it had more than 12,700 illegal  crossing arrests in just the last three weeks.  </p><p>Over the weekend, over 800 pounds of marijuana confiscated, and it is part  of the problem here they're seeing is also family units, women and children  coming, much like the caravan of migrants from Central American countries.</p><p>We spent time yesterday with the Sector Chief, a guy named Manuel Padilla,  talking about the caravan that's coming and what he says is a need for more  infrastructure.  Take a listen.</p><p>MANUEL PADILLA, CHIEF, RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR:  If we had this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure throughout my border,  we would truly transform this area.  It's a win-win situation for  everybody.</p><p>This area right here, we do not see MS-13, we do not see criminal aliens  coming into this area, because of the capability that we have through this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure.</p><p>JENKINS:  But he's only got well and about 55 of the nearly 300 parts of  this sector and it's a busy one.  The President, Maria, will be in Houston  today and Houston is in this RGV area.  I'm sure this topic will certainly  come up.  Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins is live  McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>What a scene.  We are going to be watching that as that caravan moves  closer to where Griff is actually standing.</p><p>Switching gears, a deadly train derailment in Taiwan.  Cheryl Casone with  that right now in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, good morning.</p><p>An express train went off the tracks, killing at least 18 people.  This  happened in Eastern Taiwan.  More than 150 others were injured in this  disaster.  Witnesses say all eight of the train's carriages went off the  rails as it was traveling to the eastern city of Taitung.</p><p>This comes a year after another express train on the same line derailed.   The cause of yesterday's accident, under investigation.</p><p>Well, Fiat Chrysler is unloading its car parts business.  The company is  selling the unit to Japan's Calsonic Kansei for just over $7 billion.   Calsonic is owned by the U.S. private-equity firm, KKR.  The deal is going  to make the newly-combined company one of the world's biggest auto parts  suppliers.</p><p>The FiatChrysler- - excuse me -- in the premarket up 4.6 percent, about.</p><p>And then finally, there is this.  The horror movie, \"Halloween,\" making a  killing at the box office this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this  night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been preparing for this for a long time. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is not safe to be on the streets tonight.  Go  home!  Get out of here!  Get inside!  Michael?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The film raking in $77.5 million, a record opening for the  franchise.  It also is the second-best October opening weekend of all time. </p><p>Holding on to second place, in its third weekend, \"A Star Is Born,\" $19.3  million.  </p><p>Rounding out top five, last week's big winner was \"Venom,\" followed by \"  Goosebumps 2:  Haunted Halloween,\" and, Maria, \"First Man.\"  </p><p>Jamie Curtis, she's still got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she does.  Good movies this weekend.  Thanks, Cheryl. </p><p>Coming up, a new way to calculate your FICO score, we will tell you why  your cash may help.  That's next.</p><p>And then Facebook goes shopping.  The technology giant's reported plan to  purchase a cybersecurity company, all right here after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Increasing access to credit, Fair Isaac, the  company behind the FICO score, is rolling out a major change, UltraFICO  Score will go beyond payment history.</p><p>According to the Journal this morning, it will factor in bank account  activity, how consumers manage their cash and checking, savings and money  market accounts.  It launches next year. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Mark Hamrick.  He's  Bankrate.com's Senior Economic Analyst.  </p><p>And Mark, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining  us.  </p><p>MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think this is about younger people, this new FICO  change.  Tell us about it.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Primarily, and we think about the fact that there's a large  portion of the U.S. population which really isn't doing business with  traditional financial service companies.  Millennial have been smart.   They're saving more money.</p><p>Our recent Bankrate survey found that about two-thirds of the American  public was essentially limiting its spending and millennials are doing the  best job of saving more money so that money is sitting in accounts not  necessarily being spent.</p><p>At Bankrate, we say that the two biggest problems that have been identified  by Americans is their failure to save for retirement and for emergencies.   So, financial companies want to create new customers and help connect them  to borrowing products.  It's a logical step for them.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there a way to opt out of this?  It's -- the last thing I want  with the Equifax hacking and everything going on about security, the last  thing I want is somebody to pull up my UltraFICO to see how much money --  cash I have in a bank account, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how you're managing all your money, and all your accounts.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Savings, checking.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes.  Well, to the question, I think you're right on.  I think  Americans are tired of having their personal information essentially taken  from them.  </p><p>And I think this is going to be something to watch in terms of regulation  in the coming years, whether it's the information that Facebook and Google  possess about us or our credit rating scores, because I think we have a  sense that we have no control over this information.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the -- with the -- this new FICO score, is this a way  to essentially offer people even more credit, if you will, that this is at  a time when people are increasingly stretched, that you've seen auto  lending particularly on the fringes of people with very low subprime auto  lending really being pulled back on?  </p><p>Is this a way to basically shine up people's credit scores and make them  more palatable to the lender?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  That's a very good question.  I think that is essentially the  tension that could be created by this.  In other words, giving loans to  people who are not well qualified. </p><p>But that, I don't think, is the intention.  Most financial service firms  are not looking to create new losses.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell has said that he thinks that household balance sheets are  in good shape.  He's more concerned about the commercial side.</p><p>So, I think this is more about trying to identify good data about consumers  and potential borrowers and connecting them to products that they might  find useful.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Meanwhile, you've got a new survey on how Americans are spending,  and if they're cutting back on spending, right?  Let's talk about that.  </p><p>Sixty-six percent say that they're living -- they're limiting spending,  thirty-six percent say that they are doing it to save money.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes, and I think this is a good thing.  As I said, you know, I  don't think there are many Americans that go essentially into their last  days saying, \"You know what, I saved too much money.\"  Ii think more  Americans regret that they didn't do a better job of saving for retirement  or emergencies.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And I think that 36 percent was only of the 66 percent that were  saving.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So it was only 24 percent overall that we're saving for longer  term.</p><p>The other thing that was interesting in the study was, there has long been  a contention that the big difference between how well you do in life is how  long your time horizon is.</p><p>And when you looked at the study, the people who were making over $50,000  clearly had a longer time horizon that they were saving for, whereas the  people who were under that were just sort of saving for the short-term  needs and they weren't thinking beyond that.</p><p>How, if we're going to move away from the Keynesian mentality, that the  more debt you have and the more spending you have, the better off we all  are, to one where people are more prudent and thinking about their savings,  how is borrowing going to help that happen?</p><p>HAMRICK:  I think essentially, it's two different questions.  I think the  first question is, as long as you have a healthy economy, most Americans  will be mindful of trying to achieve proper financial goals.</p><p>I do think in our society, we have a significant problem with lack of  financial literacy and that's an education issue, which i don't hear a lot  of people talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's too bad.  It really just starts at home.  But we're  certainly interested in that.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you this morning.  Mark Hamrick joining us from  Bankrate.com.  </p><p>Take a short break.  When we come back, Jamie Dimon's big bet, why J.P.  Morgan is building a campus in Silicon Valley.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then fixing traffic gridlock, details on Elon Musk's high-speed transit  tunnel.  It's nearly finished.  Will it offer free rides to the public?  We  will tell you about that.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, October  22nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  The major  indices on Wall Street looking to open higher this morning ahead of a big  week for earnings.  This right here is the high of the morning, up 73  points on the Dow Industrials, a quarter of a percent.  The NASDAQ is up  two-thirds of a percent, that's 42 points higher.  This after a mixed close  on Friday, all ahead of a big week in earnings.  This is one of the busiest  weeks we're going to see.  </p><p>Dow Industrials, on Friday, up 65 points at the close, a quarter of a  percent higher.  The S&amp;P500 was flat, down one point; and the NASDAQ was  lower by half a percent, 36 points lower on NASDAQ on Friday.  In Europe  this morning, take a look at indices, higher across the board.  FT-100 up  two-thirds of one percent; CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent;  and the DAX Index in Germany, up two-thirds of one percent right now.   Asian markets closed higher overnight.  The Shanghai Composite was up  strong, up four percent.  China's government revealing tax cuts over the  weekend to help boost that economy which has shown slowdown.  </p><p>Facebook is eyeing, shoring up its security.  The company reportedly  looking to make an acquisition in cyber sector.  Plus, the company faces  request a from Japan to beef up security.  Building the future.  Details on  JPMorgan Chase's newest investment in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you  what's behind that move.  And then a rare -- a rare reality.  Elon Musk  tweeting out date for his hyperloop transport.  When you can expect to take  a ride on a high-speed rail, from Elon Musk?  And forget getting candies in  your trick or treat bags.  We've got the very list of the U.S. cities  spending the most on Halloween this year -- it might surprise you.  </p><p>First though, our top story this half an hour.  Countdown to midterm  elections now 15 days away.  President Trump and former President Obama  squaring off in dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  President Trump will hit the campaign trail  in Houston in support of Ted Cruz, while former President Obama will  touchdown in Las Vegas and campaign there.  Enthusiasm for President Trump  is high, lines of supporters are already covering entire blocks as nearly  100,000 people wait to enter venue that can hold 18,000.  18,000 is what  the capacity is.  </p><p>Yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham to get his take on the most important issues on the ballot  this November.  President Trump has hand-picked Senator Graham to go out  and campaign for colleagues.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM:  I think people are going to be voting on the mob rule of the  Democratic Party.  If you like Democrats around the House, you know exactly  what you're going to get: They're going to try and impeach the president,  impeach Kavanaugh; they don't care about your wallet, they just want to get  in your wallet.  </p><p>If you keep Republicans in charge, we're going to keep the economy moving  forward, we're going to secure our border, we're going to deal with our  enemies throughout the world, we're going to rebuild our military.  And  when it comes to standing up to the world, you need a strong leader like  President Trump, and the Democratic Party has showed us what they would do  with power, not much for you.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the president has asked Lindsey Graham to go on the road;  he's going to talk -- he's going to be in 13 cities in just a couple of  days.  Joining us right now is Republican Strategist Kimberly Klacik.   Kimberly, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.   Your reaction to Senator Graham and what you might expect from him in the  next couple of days as he travels to 13 cities to campaign?  </p><p>KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I see this new Lindsey Graham that  we've been seeing, I expect good things.  I mean, he's absolutely right.   You know exactly what you're going to get if the Democrats take over the  House.  They have been intolerant lately.  The mob -- the mob name actually  fits them properly.  And I think for a lot of people, we don't really  understand whether or not there is a blue wave coming.  I'm not convinced.   In 2016, everyone said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, we saw that  Trump won and that's basically because people were afraid to show support  for Trump, so I don't think we really know what's going to happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's new line lately in his campaigns have been  \"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.\"  We saw that mob- thinking again this weekend when Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao  were harassed while they were at dinner, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and there was a panel in MSNBC that essentially justifies  this kind of behavior base on the fact that Merrick Garland didn't get a  vote in front of the Senate under Mitch McConnell.  That was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's justified.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, that that's justified.  And they're -- the message from  the Democrats is \"we are coming for you.\"  If you support Trump, we're  going to show up at your place of work, where you eat, where you live.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you deny that's not the mob?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is the mob.  I think that that's a great slogan.  He's --  President Trump is also really focused on immigration, attention to the  border wall, and in fact, I know that Joe Donnelly who is a Democrat  running for election in Indiana has actually running ads promoting his  support of President Trump on immigration -- border wall.  And radical left  talking about abolishing ICE.  So, smart Democrats like Donnelly in  Indiana, they know that this is an important issue to Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because -- and then you've got Kevin McCathy bringing the  bill to the floor right after midterms, Kimberly, to build the wall,  enforce the law -- act, that's what it is.  And voter interest in this  election has surged today record highs in both parties.  A new Wall Street  Journal/NBC News poll finds that nearly two-thirds of registered voters say  they are very interested in this year's midterms, that's the highest ever  recorded by the survey.  President Trump's job approval rating, as we just  heard, got a boost, the poll finds that approval rating now at 47 percent.   This is the highest of his time in office, Kimberly, going into these  midterm elections, what are your thoughts?  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, and it's well deserved.  You see, President Trump -- I don't  think the Democrats have identified that he's done anything wrong.  You  have to remember, usually, Democrats run on making promises, usually  promises they can't keep.  And so, right now, you have a bunch of problems  that Trump is solving on his own.  People were talking about immigration  and they should, because this is really a threat on our national security.   It's not about not wanting people to come in and live for the American  dream.  So, yes, they are absolutely right about this, and I think that is  why there's overwhelming support right now for President Trump, because  there's a lot of people on his side here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you know, Heather, when you look at these pictures of  this caravan making its way to the United States, it is just perfect timing  going into the midterm elections because it's a reminder that the president  is trying to secure the borders and have legal immigration.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  The caravan is the single largest one picture argument for a wall  that Trump could have ever asked for.  And particularly, when you see the  soldiers in Guatemala or the police there trying to stop it and getting  overrun on the fences, getting overrun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HIGGINS:  What's interesting about the poll that just came out, I've been  saying from the beginning that there was not going to be a blue wave and  that the Republicans, actually, I will predict will keep the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  And the poll has been interesting in that is now down to a nine- point Democrat advantage in the generic, but if you look in the  battleground states, it is completely even now.  I think, I think it is not  going to be the blue wave, I think it's going to be a major red wall, and  there's going to be more pick-ups in the Senate as well as holding of the  House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know I'm talking out both sides in my mouth, one problem,  though, in President Trump making immigration a front and center issue,  talking about the wall is the fact that the Republicans in control of the  Senate and the House didn't fully fund his wall, and they didn't basically  starve the sanctuary cities of money.  This is another can that's been  kicked down the road after midterms, so in some way, he's highlighting what  the Republicans haven't gotten done, but they haven't fulfilled agenda on  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Exactly.  This has been the biggest problem that Republicans have  had to overcome is their failure to follow through on things that they  promised to do, whether it was health care or taking on sanctuary cities or  border wall funding, I think part of the reason that you saw the tremendous  lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters until the Kavanaugh hearings was  that there was this disjunction, what had been promised versus what had  been delivered in the general sense of why would I bother voting for you?   Kavanaugh made it very clear why you would bother voting for them because  the alternative was much worse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, now, Donald Trump just gave them another reason and that's  tax cut 2.0.  So, if you think about it, no better way to mobilize people  to vote than tell them you're going to do tax cut 2.0 a couple of weeks  before election.  So, I think that timing was perfect and he's now throwing  the Democrats in a (INAUDIBLE), because he's going to make them start  talking about taxes and has done very well for Republicans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: And let not forget -- let's not forget, Kimberly, not one  Democrat voted for that tax cut plan.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, that's true.  So, how much are they really for the American  people?  I think that right now this is the perfect storm, like you said  the caravan coming is the perfect storm.  We have to remember, do we really  want people in our country, as the first thing they do when they get here  is break our laws?  We are a nation of laws and we deserve to know who our  neighbors are, and we should be vetting legal immigrants.  I think,  honestly, I don't see the blue wave either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kimberly, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kimberly Klacik joining us there.  Coming up, doubling down on  data protection, details on Facebook's reported plans to purchase a  cybersecurity company, that's next.  And then getting into the Halloween  spirit, we will tell you the city spending the most money on Halloween  ahead of October 31.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New pressure this morning on Facebook over data  protection, Cheryl Casone on it in headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, the Japanese government has ordered Facebook to better  protect user data.  Japan's asking the company to fully communicate  security issues to its users and inform regulators of any change in  security measures.  This, of course, comes after Facebook said earlier this  month, hackers stole information of about 30 million people.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly planning to go buy a major cybersecurity  firm.  Reports say Facebook has approached several companies for a  potential acquisition.  Taking a look at shares of the company down 13  percent so far this year, there's Facebook.  </p><p>Well, JPMorgan Chase is planning to build a new campus that's going to  focus on Fintech or Financial Technology.  This campus is going to be out  in Silicon Valley.  More than 1,000 employees are going to work at the  campus when it opens up in Palo Alto in 2020.  A project part of an effort  by JPMorgan to keep up with changes in digital payments which is big  business.  Most of the employers are going to work for JPMorgan Chase's  merchant services division.  Shares of JPMorgan are up nearly one percent  so far this year.  </p><p>And Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry in the United States.   So, this year, Americans are expected to spend $9 billion on candy,  costumes, decorations.  That works out to an average 86 bucks per person.   And 24/7 Wall Street created an index to see which cities actually spend  the most on Halloween.  And this year, the top of the list: Number one,  Phoenix; right behind it, L.A., Honolulu, Burbank, and Paradise, Nevada.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money on candy and Halloween stuff.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's a lot of yummy candy, that's all I can say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, are we going to have some Halloween candy onset at some  point?  </p><p>CASONE:  I'm working on it.  You know I'm on that.  You read my mind. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I figured there were some story around that.  That can get some  chocolate up here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whole Foods sells vegan candy corn.  I found that yesterday.   Quite delicious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one.  Good info.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why Phoenix is number one the list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>KELLY:  Because of my sister, she goes by Pauline Halloween, and she makes  it the whole month and she spends -- I mean, this is her Super Bowl.  This  is, like, what she lives for every year.  So, I can -- that explains.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was surprised its Phoenix.  I don't know why.  </p><p>KELLY:  I'm not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of decorations here in New York are pretty funny.  People  get into it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  My kids are now, all three, simultaneously in college, but it  wasn't too long ago where the house was decorated stem to stern and we put  in a haunted house and all the rest of it.  And now, all of that stuff  stays in the basement because we're not at trick or treat age.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A very young French girl in my building told me that she's going  as one of the pink ladies, and she said, do you know who the pink ladies  are?  And I went, my dear, I saw Greece when it was released, at drive-in  movie theater.  And she went, what's a driving --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>KELLY:  That's amazing.</p><p>HIGGINS:  That is funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, going  underground.  Elon Musk's infrastructure firm, the Boring Company gearing  up to unveil its first high-speed transit tunnel.  Details on the launch  right after this.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk out with new details about his high- speed hyperloop transport.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.   Lauren, good morning. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good morning, we have a date and we have a place.  So, this is  what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend: \"First tunnel almost done.\"  And  then he responded to a follower on Twitter, when: Well, \"opens December  10th.\"  His Boring Company on December 11th, will then take the public on  free rides of a tunnel track.  </p><p>Check this out, which will run in Hawthorne, California from SpaceX --  another one of Musk's company -- it's North 200th Street, then west from  there for about two miles.  It uses a loop system, which transports a car  or a vehicle, as you can see on platform, which they called the skate and  it basically skates you 150 miles an hour to your destination, no traffic,  no speeding ticket.  </p><p>When Musk first announced the boring company back in 2016 because he was  bored sitting in traffic, most people thought he was nuts.  But once again,  the visionary CEO making due on pie in the sky idea and inviting the public  to try it out for free and that maybe his way of faring well in the court  of public opinion because at least two of his tunnels face lawsuits.  </p><p>In California, they're worried about environment and what tunneling in  seismic-prone areas could do to residents' homes.  Now, Musk is also  working on a tunnel from Dodger's stadium to a nearby train station -- but  that one will not be opened for the World Series.  I know a lot of people  would appreciate that as we gear up for the big games tomorrow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  I think it's going to be great.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  An electric subterranean train station, essentially.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but the real question is, can my face be pulled back?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, he promised that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, I'm dead serious.  His follower said, is this is going to  be like a really cool disco-like experience?  And he said, yes, so there's  going to be something cool happening in those tunnels -- it's kind of scary  if you ask me.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So, when exactly are you trying out if the tunnels aren't yet  built?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, this would be taking someone -- the two or three miles to  the destination.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  OK.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, they're actually going to put people in that tunnel near  Hawthorne, California.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does anybody think Elon Musk is doing too much, given that you  have a publicly traded auto company that's struggling, largely in part  because of your own shenanigans?  So, maybe you ought to focus on one  thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with all of that, he's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But he's also delivering.  And then someone asked him, is he  going to be done in Elon time or real-time, and he said, I hope real-time,  but yes, he has his hands in many baskets but he is delivering on this, and  especially in Los Angeles where the traffic is terrible.  Look, this could  be the future of transportation and the future might be here and now or at  least the start of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you listen to that Joe Rogan podcast, the whole thing, he  clearly is, like, the permitting process is impossible in Los Angeles,  right?  And so, to act like this is going to solve the problems of  commuters in Los Angeles is a bit farfetched.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But they don't have a good metro station there.  </p><p>KELLY:  I would rather ride this than go on SpaceX to Mars, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My point is that, well, you know what, you're going to be able  to go to Mars before you can drive around to L.A. in a tunnel.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't know.  What do you guys think will happen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's going to take time --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Decades.  Centuries. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- with the regulations.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's gotten exemptions from certain authorities to do the test  tubes of this, if you will, but you're right.  Now, they do have to come  through with the overall permitting process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Lauren, thank you.  Coming up,  still ahead, battle at the border, details on the migrant caravan with over  5,000 people in it approaching the United States, that's next hour right  here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.

President Trump says he  wants to get something done before November -- that's eight days from now.   What it means ahead of the midterm elections to hear such an announcement.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.   Great to see you this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Nice to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to start the week off  with thinking there will be new tax cuts, right -- tax cuts 2.0, making  things permanents.  That's a great way to start the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It's an excellent way to go into the midterms.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump is trying to  get that economy, because that's his strongest issue -- number one in the  eyes of voters.  Because the latest Fox News poll, it was actually health  care.  And Republicans are a little bit back on their heels on the health  care issue.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  That's why he's been talking about pre-existing conditions too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because they're running -- 50 percent of the ads that  Democrats are running are about health care.  And many of them focusing on  pre-existing conditions and trying to message that Republicans want to  remove those protections.</p><p>But in terms of the polling -- 47 percent approval rating for the President  according to the new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll -- his highest during his  time in office.  The enthusiasm gap has closed to 4 percentage points,  that's a very small advantage for the Democrats.</p><p>And to Heather's point earlier, \"The Cook Report\", nonpartisan, finds that  parties are dead even on the question of who should control Congress in  districts rated as the most competitive -- dead even.  And there was a 13  percentage point advantage for the Democrats just in the last month's poll  among registered voters.  So that advantage has disappeared.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why.  I saw an ad this weekend.  It's like do you  want Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house?  And I was like no.  I  was like -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Maxine Waters running the Financial Services  Committee?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Elijah Cummings or Jerry Nadler running the  Judiciary?  </p><p>KELLY:  That's the best ad.  It's like ok, you don't have to like us.  You  just don't want them to be in control of the House.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  In fact, when I wrote the piece publicly predicting that Trump  was going to win, when he was at his nadir that August, I said what's going  to happen to Republican voters even those who don't like how Trump talks  and don't like other things about him, they're going to look at the  alternative of what Hillary would mean in terms of continued policies, et  cetera.  And they're going to hold their noses and they're going to vote  for Trump and join the people who were voting for him.</p><p>And the same thing is going to happen with these midterm elections.  While  the spin is being put on it, which is not incorrect, that if the  Republicans lose the House, this creates a fantastic foil for Trump and  almost guarantees re-election in 2020.</p><p>The reality is, is that he wants a Republican Congress because he's running  on fulfilling his promises and getting things done, which is also going to  make him impossible to beat in 2020.  What you're seeing in the polls is  exactly what all of our work, all this year was.</p><p>And we kept saying to the Republicans, the economy alone is not going to be  your winning issue.  You're going to get really taken to the cleaners by  the left on health care and on your supposed cruelty on immigration and you  better be prepared.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks like the President at this point is expecting Biden to  be on the other side of the podium in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's at the top of polls in terms of Democratic contenders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the President now has a name for him -- 1 percent, Joe -- 1  percent or something else.  The name came out this weekend.  You knew that.   Ok, well this is who the President is taking serious.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It's also the public said this because Biden is the best known  name, right, in their heads in terms of presidential aspiration.  Over time  that's going to shift.  Biden tends to want to be anointed, not to actually  have to work for things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He also has historically had a lot of trouble fund raising.  So  that is to his disadvantage in terms of running for the Democratic  nomination -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which is what keeps Nancy Pelosi front and center in the  party.  She's a great fundraiser.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  Phenomenal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- something else walks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- actually something else actually talks too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Our top story this hour is the looming crisis at the border --  another issue for the midterm elections.  The migrant caravan from Honduras  has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.  It  crossed into Mexico over the weekend and it sets up a potential showdown at  the U.S. border where President Trump says he will use the military if  necessary to stop these people from coming in.</p><p>Here now is Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman -- thanks  very much for joining us.</p><p>First, let me get your thoughts on this migrant caravan, your reaction to  this.  What should the U.S. do?  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well first of all, Maria -- good  morning to everyone.</p><p>This is indicative of the fact that the situation at the border is and has  been chaotic.  We've been saying this for years.  It's critical that the  United States secure its border, build the wall, get other technology to  make sure that our borders are safe and secure.</p><p>And this is an intolerable situation.  We cannot have throngs of people  just coming across porous borders.  It's a crisis that needs to be dealt  with now.  And it needs to be dealt with in the future.  That's why we've  got to secure our border.  That's why we've got to build the wall and make  sure that our southern border is safe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your colleague, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is  introducing a bill that would fully fund the President's border wall.  You  were an original co-sponsor of the bill.  Is its going to pass the house?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Sure, it will definitely pass the House.  Of course, the  arduous task has been always the Senate, the Senate the Senate.  But yes,  it will pass the House.  It's an important bill.  It gives what we wanted,  what the President wanted to fully fund the border wall.</p><p>But also, to make sure that we have other technology because it's very  important to realize that the wall can be built in certain areas but there  are other areas where the wall can't be built.  We have to use other  advanced technologies to make sure that we keep the illegal immigration  from coming across.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how much -- Kevin McCarthy says that this bill funds $23  billion, which is what's needed for the border wall because $1.5 billion  has already been accounted for.</p><p>But this weekend when I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked him  will it pass the Senate, he goes the Senate has $5 billion towards the  border wall.  He ignored the $23 billion that Kevin McCarthy is talking  about.  So where's the disconnect?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, the disconnect clearly is that the President and the  House have a much easier task to pass what they need.  The Senate, because  of the numbers, they need to get to 60, have had a lesser number. </p><p>I will say this.  If we get the McCarthy bill passed, and I think we will  in the House, it will give the Senate particularly this year an opportunity  to sit down and get that done and build the wall in a much more robust way.</p><p>Let's face it.  We did start with $5 billion, that's a start.  I actually  sit on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee and that's very important to me.  It's important  to our subcommittee.  I think it's important to most Americans.  We're  seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really  anarchistic the border situation has become.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the bottom line here in terms of the economic  proposals out of the administration.  Over the weekend, the President said  that another round of tax cuts is in the works aimed at the middle class.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be some time just prior I would say to November.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the status of this legislation?  I mean, you know, the  House is on -- out on recess until the midterms.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we'll be back in November, hopefully looking forward to  a new Republican majority in both houses; but having said that it's very  important to realize that the first round of tax cuts was very important.   We had to get corporate done.  We did.  That's making America competitive  again.  We put more money in the hands of hard-working Americans.</p><p>But we need to refine it now.  Obviously it was so important to get tax  reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually very  sad.  And I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.  </p><p>This was a very good bill the first time.  We're just going to make it  better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  But I mean the economy is growing well. </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 4.25 percent.  There's increasing worries  about the deficit.  Do we need another tax cut plan right now?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, when you look at it as an aggregate, as I've always  said, you reduce tax rates on everyone, more money actually comes into the  Treasury.  Why?  You incentivize work.  You incentivize investment.   Whether you're John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump, you realize  lower taxes means ultimately more money for the Treasury.  And I think  that's a good thing.</p><p>When we talk about deficits, we actually have to look at the spending side  of the equation and sadly really no one wants to look at that right now,  especially on the mandatory side of the equation.  Ultimately, I hope we  get there.</p><p>But if we don't have a taxing problem in America, we have a spending  problem in America.  So right now, more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans is good for the economy and good for the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Saudi Arabia and the U.S.- Saudi relations on  the line.  Secretary Mnuchin is traveling to Saudi today.  Some lawmakers  are calling for some harsh penalties against the Kingdom over its role  killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>I spoke with Senate Armed Services Committee member Lindsey Graham  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  Here's his take.  Listen to this --  Congressman.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  I'd like  to punish those involved.  The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment,  sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this.  And I find it  impossible to believe that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So go after  him and his inner circle.</p><p>Save the alliance.  I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business  with the current leadership, MBS.  He's done to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Congressman?  Does MBS, the Crown Prince  need to step down?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, first of all, let me commend President Trump.  He's  handled this crisis very well.  He demanded facts, he's getting facts.   We're getting into the investigation right now.</p><p>But his response to this and he's withholding judgment on the final  punishment -- and I think that's very smart.  Looking at it this way --  Saudi Arabia is a key actor in the Middle East.  This was a tragedy.  We  can't say it any other way.  It should not have happened.  It's an  atrocity, what happened to this journalist.  </p><p>However, we have to make sure that the punishment or the sanction fits what  they did and punishes the people who are accountable, who actually did  this.  Having said that, Saudi Arabia just made a major military purchase  from the United States, they are a key actor, if you will, a key check on  Iran and other countries in the region who have been aberrant lately.  So  we've got to have a reasoned response.</p><p>And I think President Trump has handled this perfectly.  He's looking at  it.  He's concerned about it.  He's condemned it.  But he's going to make  sure that the punishment fits the crime.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in the midterms -- Congressman, in terms  of how this plays out, 15 days away?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I'm optimistic.  Let's face it.  The Senate is trending up  very well in our great state of Tennessee.  Marsha Blackburn in a key state  is going to do very well.  I think she's going to win.  Looking across the  map, the Senate's in very good shape.</p><p>A month ago I was extremely concerned about the House.  Those competitive  House seats, though, have moved much tighter.  It's gone very well.  I  think we're going to hold the House.  It's razor-thin.</p><p>But I think Independents are going to see that the Democratic Party has  really gone off the rails.  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, like the  Republican Party, used to at least play on the same field.  The Democrats  sadly have jettisoned so far to the left -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  -- that I think the American people need to cure this and I  think Independents will do that and come out and vote for Republicans.  My  prediction -- we will hold the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Rod Rosenstein under fire, what House Judiciary  Chairman Bob Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from the deputy  attorney general when he testifies on Wednesday.</p><p>Then steal a base, win a taco -- how you can win free food during the World  Series, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>An intense manhunt is underway this morning after a police officer is shot  and killed in Georgia.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well Maria -- one suspect is  already under arrest in the death of 30-year-old officer Antoine Tony.   Police say tony and other officers were responding to calls of a suspicious  vehicle.  When the officers found that car, shots were fired from inside  and one of those shots hit Tony.  Police are now searching for 18-year-old  Tafahree Maynard, wanted for murder.</p><p>Forty-two police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year.   That's already seven more than all of last year.</p><p>Well, U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is in Moscow this week for  what's expected to be some pretty tense talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin and other officials over U.S. plans to pull out of a nuclear  arms treaty.  The Kremlin says President Trump's decision is a cause for  deep concern.  It would make the world a more dangerous place.</p><p>Senator Rand Paul on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" says withdrawing from the treaty is  a bad idea.  .</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple  of months ago.  And they still regard this, this reduction of nuclear arms  and the disaster that would be nuclear war.  I don't want to see another  nuclear arms race with Russia or with any other country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the U.S. claims that Russia has violated the agreement which  forbids the use of intermediate and short range rockets.  The Kremlin  adding the U.S. has not formally communicated its intentions to leave the  treaty to Russia.</p><p>And then there is this.  Papa John's founder, John Schnatter requesting the  company, amend its poison pill plan.  Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in  the company but he's prohibited from buying more stock until July of 2019  under a poison pill plan put in place by the board of directors.  Well  Schnatter was ousted, you may remember as chairman back in July after  racially-charged comments he made on a conference call leaked out to the  press.</p><p>Here's the stock.  Shares of Papa John's are down about 7 percent so far  this year.  And Maria -- as you can see on the chart, the pressure has been  on that stock as Schnatter's troubles have increased.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.</p><p>All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a shakeup at CBS, the details as interim chairman, Richard  Parsons, is stepping down from the board now just a few weeks after  entering.</p><p>Then Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings -- we break down  those numbers.  As you can see, Hasbro now down 9 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are higher ahead of the open this morning.  Investors are bracing  for the biggest week of third quarter earnings yet this week.</p><p>Dow Industrials up better than 90 points ahead of all of these earnings  coming out, a third of a percent.  We've got big names like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet -- all set to report.  Those are Nasdaq  companies.  And the Nasdaq is up this morning as you see all the numbers  coming out from a number of companies -- Caterpillar, McDonald's, also  market movers there.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about that is Wells Fargo senior global equity  strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- it's good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us this morning.</p><p>What are your expectations for earnings and heading into the earnings  season, is it priced in to markets?  </p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Well, Maria --  good morning.</p><p>And I think what really people want to know, what the market wants to know  is -- we know these earnings are going to be good overall -- 20 percent,  maybe a little bit more than that.  But I think what the market really  wants to hear about is what's going to happen in 2019 because clearly  earnings growth in 2019 is going to be nowhere near what it is this year.</p><p>And then of course, you know, what's the cost?  What are these tariffs  doing to costs?  Is there wage pressure?  Anything that affects margins.   So I think that's what's really more important than the absolute results  because, you know, we know they're going to be good results.  </p><p>KELLY:  Scott -- it's pretty interesting what's happening in the market  right now and that's obviously the dislocations seem to be about one of  those costs and that's the rising cost of capital, right, going up.</p><p>But to me, it doesn't seem like the Fed is really, you know, making a  mistake here, given that inflation's up about 2.5 percent over the last 12  months but their Fed funds rate is still below that, so it's negative on  real terms.</p><p>Where do you see the Fed going next year?  Where do you see rates going?   And how is that going to impact where the market goes for the next year?   Because it seems if we're only up 4 percent so far this year, could we have  another year next year where it's only up a couple percent?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think, you know, as far as our fixed income group, they're  looking for a hike in December which I think the Fed is certainly directing  the market toward that.  They're also looking for three more next year, so  basically between now and the end of 2019, looking for four more hikes.</p><p>From an equity strategy point of view, we think that that -- you know,  that's really -- you're kind of at the red line and I think the market is  going to be very sensitive to any hint or conversation or enthusiasm out of  Jay Powell that, you know, hey, we might increase the pace here, which I  think would -- the market would not take very well.</p><p>Now, as far as the S&amp;P 500 right now, at least based on our analysis,  stocks are pretty close to fair value.  Our year-end target has been 2800  to 2900.  We're just a touch below there.  And I think probably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, you could see the S&amp;P 500 -- let's call  it 8 percent higher than where we are now.</p><p>So even though we think stocks are pretty fairly valued right now, still  think there's some upside here, still think the bull market is not over.   We still want to lean towards those sectors that are sensitive to a  continuation of the recovery.  We don't want our clients hiding right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott-- it's Dagen McDowell.  What do you make of the \"Wall  Street Journal\" highlights slowing sales growth and how that's a major head  wind for the markets?  Noting that third quarter sales are expected to be  up 7.3 percent from the same period last year, this is for the S&amp;P 500.   But that is the lowest rate for the S&amp;P in four quarters. </p><p>And Lindsey Bell has been on this program and voiced her concerns as well  about that.  </p><p>WREN:  You know, Dagen-- last quarter I have to say we were looking for  about -- in the second quarter we were looking for about 8 percent growth  and it came in close to 10 percent.  So our number for this third quarter  reporting season was 8 percent and we're a touch below that.</p><p>So, you know, I would consider really anything, you know, at this point in  the cycle, anything you know, 6 to 8 percent maybe 9 -- 6 to 9 percent  earnings growth or revenue growth, rather, I think that's good.  And I  think next year you'll probably see something at the lower end of that  range.</p><p>But I think that's what the market expects.  It's probably priced in and  really, you know, 7 percent or 8 percent earnings growth in the third  quarter I don't really think that's going to bother investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would put new money to work right here then, Scott?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely -- Maria.  You know, we're going to open this morning  basically sitting right on the 200 day moving average.  And we closed below  it a time or two over the last couple of weeks.  But right now I think  you're at a point where if you have money on the sidelines, you need to  start legging in.  And if we trade a little bit lower here, you should  continue to do that.</p><p>So if you have a certain amount of money, you know, at these levels, put a  third of it in and if we go a little bit lower, step in with another third  because if you think as I do that a trade war is unlikely, that we're going  to continue to see decent international growth that's based on what our  economists are looking at, we're going to see decent growth here in the  U.S., then the forward fundamentals look pretty good.  And we want our  clients stepping in here and getting exposure if they have cash on the  sidelines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Scott -- we'll be watching.  Thanks so much.  Scott  Wren -- </p><p>WREN:  All right.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us there from Wells Fargo.</p><p>Coming up, a college party turns into a nightmare -- The latest  developments after the floor collapses, injuring at least 30 people.</p><p>Then, demanding answers, what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein this upcoming Wednesday when Rosenstein testifies.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 22nd.   Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>A higher start for the week for stock prices.  Take a look, markets are at  the highs right now, Dow Industrials set to open up about 100 points this  morning, that's almost one half of one percent higher.  NASDAQ is up three- quarters of a percent right now, that's the high of the morning, up 54  points on the NASDAQ.  And the S&amp;P is off third of a percent, 10 points  higher.  </p><p>This after a mixed day on Friday for the major indices at the close.  The  Dow Industrials were up 65 points, a quarter of a percent.  But the NASDAQ  was lower and the S&amp;P was also down one point on the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look, markets are seeing some gains here as  well.  FT-100 up almost one percent, 59 points higher.  CAC Quarante in  Paris up a half a percent, 23 points higher.  DAX Index in Germany up two- thirds of one percent, 77 points higher.  </p><p>Asian markets also closed higher overnight, China was the best performer,  Shanghai Composite up better than four percent.

All that coming up.</p><p>Then this, free tacos, we will tell you about Taco Bell's promotion to give  away free food during tomorrow's World Series.  </p><p>All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein will appear before House  investigators this upcoming Wednesday.  The interview will be closed --  will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will be  transcribed.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte telling me  yesterday in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" what  investigators are looking for specifically.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We want to  know in particular about the new developments that we've been made aware of  about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees  and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the  president of the United States.  His boss, the chief executive officer of  our country.  </p><p>And the possibility of pulling together cabinet members to invoke the 25th  Amendment to the United States constitution which would be a mechanism to  declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice  president presumably serving in his place.  </p><p>These are very, very serious allegations.  We have all of this based upon a  newspaper report and we have third party testimony that we've heard in our  investigation.  We know he's met with President Trump.  President Trump has  been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two  at the Department of Justice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOODLATTE:  But the Congress has oversight responsibility so we're going to  ask him about those questions along with many other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial an analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  You only --  good morning.  You almost can't make this up really when you -- when you  think about it.  The people that Congressman Goodlatte's folks have  interviewed were not in the room when deputy attorney general Rosenstein  said this.  He doesn't seem to be much of as it be whether or not he said  it.  He says it was sarcastic.  Three people in the room say it was  sarcastic.  One person in the room, Andrew McCabe, fired from the FBI for  lying, said I interpret it seriously.  </p><p>The president either isn't worried about it or is biding his time until  after the midterm elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's more that's going to be on the -- on the  table obviously on Wednesday with Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goodlatte is also looking to get to the bottom of what was said  to the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When they actually applied for a warrant to wiretap someone who  worked with the Trump campaign which of course is Carter Page.  And what  we've heard now from John Ratcliffe as well as Congressman Goodlatte is  that the Obama administration officials withheld information to the FISA  court in order to get that warrant.  Here's Bob Goodlatte on that issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  There's a lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements  and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that.  He came into this matter at  the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal  of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court in  secret to approve a wiretap on an individual, who's a United States citizen  and this went on for a full year.  The last three months of which Mr.  Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.  So we have questions for  him about that and we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, judge?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, I've been a very harsh critic for FISA for a  long time.  In my view, it is a corrupt way for the Justice Department to  use the lower FISA standard, probable cause of communicating with a foreign  person as opposed to the higher constitutional standard, you get a warrant,  probable cause of crime, in order to get the camel's nose under the tent.   In order to start listening to what someone is saying because they don't  have probable cause of crime but they do have probable cause of talking to  a foreign person.  Carter Page hasn't been charged with anything.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They served failed every conceivable thing about him for a  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was such -- he was such an enemy of the state, you would  have seen charges by now.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why the story outrages me.  And you know, the fact, what  John Ratcliffe told us is that when you have two pieces of information, you  have one thing from the unverified dossier to present to the FISA court,  then you have another piece of information that completely refutes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It refutes anything that Trump had anything to do with Russia  collusion, but they didn't present that to the FISA court.  They held that  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think -- I think you and I talked, maybe it was last week  about an experience I had on the bench where I learned that when  investigators came to me for an emergency search warrant which I signed.   They did not tell me what they also knew about it.  Years later, trying the  case, I said how did you get this -- how did you get this search warrant?   Did you tell the judge about this?  Not realizing that it was me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And I threw the charges out.  </p><p>So, the consequences of misbehavior by agents of the executive branch,  whether at the state level where I was or the federal level which is what  we're talking about, by not telling everything to the court can be  catastrophic for whatever they are trying to accomplish.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's Maria's issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are on the story like no one else, not just in T.V. but in  the media in general.  Because it falls by the wayside as people move on to  like out -- the outrage at the moment.  This is outrageous.  Because there  aren't any consequences.  Will anybody ever pay for doing this?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- who knows?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's put this in context of where we are, ia presidential  election year, the year is 2016.  You had one team wanting to spy on the  other team.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You had Hillary's team and the Obama administration saying you  know what, let's spy on Trump.  Let's do this.  And then, they get the  warrant to do so.  It's wrong.  It's disgusting.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two aspects here that we haven't talked about and that  is when the president of the United States said I'm going to release all  this FISA stuff, I haven't seen it but my people -- but my people have seen  it.  Who went to him and begged him not to?  British intelligence and  Israeli intelligence, which tells you their fingerprints are on it.  Which  tells you that through Jack Brennan the Obama administration was more  likely than not using foreign intelligence to commence its surveillance of  then candidate Trump and the people are watching them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they were just trying to do whatever they could to spy on  the political enemy.  It's as simple as that.  They wanted to spy on their  political enemy.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yet again, but it was also Susan  Rice didn't have -- she used surveillance, right?  She put in for the  application.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then unmasked everybody.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one -- I don't know this to be so.</p><p>KELLY:  This is getting back (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one that got this information to the  Washington Post.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And then they leaked it.  The strategy was  incredible.  </p><p>First, come up with this narrative, that Trump had anything to do with  Russia meddling.  Then, leak it to the media, let it -- get it into the  site guys.  Then, get informants to lure Trump people and say, Donald  Junior, let's go do a meeting, I've got this informant.  They're all  informants.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are some very angry Republicans about what Congressman  Goodlatte told you yesterday and who are they?  Republicans on the  committee that are not permitted to participate in this interrogation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan say Rosenstein's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- writing the rules for his own testimony because it was Rod  Rosenstein who said, you know what, we want two Republicans and two  Democrats in the room.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, when that happens and when it is recorded -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  on Wednesday.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  And then goes to the Intelligence Committee to  whitewash any classified material.  Then Republicans will leak their  version and Democrats will leak their version.  Yet again, instead of  letting the American people see that what the people we sent to Washington  to work for us are doing -- excuse me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  With the power we gave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that, declassify.  And President needs --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They talked the -- they talked the president out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  The president needs to declassify these  documents so the American people can understand what went on here.  Is this  going to have a factor in the midterm?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  When and when and if it comes out, I think  it will be too late.  I don't -- I don't think this can -- this can come  out in the next two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham also had a lot to say about this and he's going  to be doing a 13 city tour.  He's now, you know, looked at by the  Republican as the guy to sell their colleagues.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he became very popular when in the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  After Kavanaugh.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- in the midst of the Kavanaugh hearings, enough was enough,  I'm tired of this prosecutor from Arizona asking the questions, I'm tired  of what the Democrats are doing.  I'm going to take charge here and he did.   He lost his temper, or at least, it appeared that he did.  But he  galvanized a lot of the Republican base as well as all the Republicans on  the committee.  And pretty much chasing the Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because people felt like he was -- he was speaking for them.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody who was on the right felt the same way that Lindsey  Graham did.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think they're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Watching these hearings.  So, whether -- and he just spoke from  his heart.  I mean, being a very blunt, passionate southerner.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I recognize that kind of behavior.  He's like enough is enough.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Are you a one passionate southerner?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm probably more prone to expletives than the senator.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  McKenzie, do we have the sound bite of Lindsey Graham?  I want  to tell you what Lindsey Graham said about the midterm elections and  specifically this investigation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The FBI investigation.  He's expecting to be the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham is.  Here's Lindsey Graham  with me yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, the House promises to  impeach the president and Kavanaugh.  I think the Republicans will continue  to try to hold the FBI and Department of Justice accountable for abuse of  power.  </p><p>If I'm the chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year, we hold the  Senate.  I promise you we're going to find out about the Simpson -- Fusion  GPS problem.  I promise you, we're going to get to the bottom of how they  used a dossier, prepared by foreign agents, paid for by the Democratic  Party to get a warrant against an American citizen.  We're not going to  turn our back on this.</p><p>If I'm chairman, we're going to get to the bottom of this.  And the only  way for me to be chairman is for us to hold the Senate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if the Republicans hold the senate, as seems likely, if  the Democrats take the House which this morning seems likely, the two  chairs of the Judiciary Committee couldn't be more opposite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerry Nadler.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And all the stuff that Congressman Goodlatte wants to come  out, the Democrats take the House, we'll never see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It goes away.  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Another consequence of this midterm election.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, great to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know I was kidding, McD.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know you were -- of course you were -- not really, actually.   Expletive, expletive, expletive.  You're lucky I didn't say -- you know  what, if I was really mad, I'd say --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I want to hear you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  coming up, major changes at CBS to tell you about, the details  as interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning from the company's board,  that's next.</p><p>And then a brawl on the basketball court, why three players and the lead  singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were ejected.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Get this, a college party turned into a  nightmare.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl, what a story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  These poor kids, Maria.  About  30 people sent to the hospital after a floor suddenly gave way beneath them  during a party near the campus of Clemson University.  This happened in  South Carolina.  The whole thing captured on a party-goers iPhone.  </p><p>Yes, well, a witness says people were jumping to a popular song when the  floor just caved in.  Clemson said the police said none of the injuries are  luckily, life-threatening.  </p><p>Well, the interim chairman of CBS resigned after a month on the job due to  health issues.  Richard Parsons is stepping down after his doctors told him  to reduce his workload so he can deal with complications from multiple  myeloma.  Strauss Zelnick, another new board member is going to take over  for Parsons.  Shares of CBS are down three percent so far this year.  </p><p>Then there is this, guys, Senator Elizabeth Warren defending her decision  to take a DNA test to prove she is indeed part Native American.  So, at a  debate yesterday for her Senate seat, Warren said that she did it to,  quote:  Rebuild trust in the government through transparency.  </p><p>In March, Warren had said that no DNA test was needed to prove her claim  but she said she ultimately took the test which showed a relative six to 10  generations ago was indeed Native American.  And we played the ad for our  viewers last week, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what was -- what was that, one, 1000.  </p><p>CASONE:  Six to 10 generations.  Six grandparents ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the -- at the -- at the least, she is one, 1,024th native  American, which would put here at a lower percentage than the average  European-American in terms of the percentage of their background that is  Native American.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we still talking about this?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because she can't shut up about it.</p><p>KELLY:  Because Democrats --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She thinks the more she talks about it, she's somehow going to  be right.  Number one, she caved in to President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number one.  Number two, Harvard law school was presenting her  as their first woman of color.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In print.  Harvard law spokesman -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, she did gain them -- she gained from lying.  </p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  This is --  this is why it mattered.  As she was technically their minority person on  their faculty.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And so she deliberately traded on this part of status of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You know, which is not knowing that it was in any way true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Are you a Taco Bell fan?  We will tell you how you  can score a free taco during the World Series, next.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are seven weeks into the NFL season.  The standings are  beginning to take shape.  Jared Max said the Chiefs are on top in the AFC.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria, the AFC really  looks like a two-team race between the Chiefs and the Patriots.  </p><p>One week after New England handed Kansas City its first loss, on the last  second field goal, Kansas City barbecued the Bengals, 45-10.   PatrickMahomes, four more touchdown passes, the Chiefs goes to 6-1, 45-10.  </p><p>Because of a snap penalty against Dallas, the Cowboy's 47-yard potential  game tying field goal became a 52-yarder.  Would have been good for 47, but  the Redskins win.  First place Redskins beat the Cowboys 20-17.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Losers, the Cowboys.  Losers.  Continue, Jared.  </p><p>MAX:  The Carolina Panthers -- the Carolina Panthers came back from 17 down  to beat the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles by three.  Panthers' Eric  Reid earlier had to be restrained before the opening coin toss.  Reid went  after the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and other players.  </p><p>Now, last year Jenkins co-founded the NFL players coalition to work with  the league on social justice issues.  Now, Jenkins no longer kneels for the  anthem.  Reid does.  And he thinks Jenkins is a sellout.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC REID, SAFETY, PANTHERS:  I believe Malcolm capitalized on the  situation.  He co-opted the movement that was started by Collin to get his  organization funding.  It's cowardly.  He sold us out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Sold them out, wow.  </p><p>And football, we have feistiness and also in the NBA.  After Saturday's  Lakers, Rockets game, became fight night at L.A. at the NBA, suspends three  players total of nine games without pay.  Chris Paul of the Rockets, two  games suspended.  He poked Rajon Rondo in the eye.  Rondo started to punch  Paul.  He got three games, one more than Paul, because he threw the first  punch and appears to have spit right at Chris Paul.  Now, this instigated  the fight.  Rondo throws a several punches and the Lakers Brandon Ingram  gets four games.  Wow.  </p><p>World Series begins tomorrow night on Fox at Fenway Park.  The Red Sox  favored to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Chris Sale will be Boston's game  one starter, likely Clayton Kershaw for L.A.  </p><p>World Series provisionally Taco Bell will give out free Doritos tacos --  free Doritos Locos Tacos, got to go crazy, for four hours on November 1st,  all we have to see is a base get stolen in the World Series and the free  Doritos Locos Tacos is yours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, bring on the Locos Tacos.  </p><p>MAX:  Two quiero, Taco Bell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p>CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.   Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government  revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.  </p><p>Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi  Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action  against the kingdom.  This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad  bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their  condolences.  </p><p>Plus, caravan crisis.  The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United  States border is growing.  It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on  that caravan.</p><p>On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol  Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House  investigators.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p>We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p>So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p>KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p>HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p>He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p>The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p>And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p>And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p>And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p>And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p>We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p>YORK:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p>The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p>ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p>YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p>We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p>Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p>HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p>YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p>The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p>And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p>However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p>So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p>We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p>The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p>Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p>And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p>OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p>Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p>European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p>The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p>All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p>FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p>FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p>FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p>FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p>FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p>FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p>FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p>FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p>FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p>FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p>FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p>News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.   Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.  I have alerted  Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency.  Must change  laws!\"  That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed  to the border of the U.S.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, we're watching oil.  Brent  rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00  and change, what's driving this market.  Then, 15 days until midterm  elections.  The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart  Varney on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The economy under President Trump, the  President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections  according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p>I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p>I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p>Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p>SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning  to you.  Thank you so much.  Happy Monday.  We'll see you in a little bit,  girls.  Thank you.  It is Monday, October 27th -- October 22nd.  Good  morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher.  Here are your top stories.  6:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting for gains, futures indicating the markets this morning will open  fractionally better on the session.  Dow Industrials up 25, NASDAQ up 31  right now, half a percent higher.</p><p>This after a mixed story on Wall Street on Friday.  The market snapped a  two-day losing streak, posting a slight gain on the session with the Dow  Industrials up 65 points, quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  weaker on Friday at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are edging higher, take a look.  FT-100 up  a half percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of a percent, 40 points higher. </p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board at the close.  And as you see,  the Shanghai Composite, the best performer out of China, up better than  four percent on the session.</p><p>Stocks in china soaring.  The government revealing tax changes to help  support the slowing economy.  And with that, a multi-move across the board,  and the averages, best in four years.</p><p>Investors bracing for the busiest week of earnings season so far.  Ten Dow  Components due to report their third quarter earnings, plus technology  giants Amazon and Alphabet on deck this week.</p><p>On Friday, we get the first look at third quarter GDP.  That could be a  market mover.  We'll break it all down and we got all the preview on  earnings as well.</p><p>Another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says that  he wants to get something done before November eight days from now, what  that means ahead of the midterm elections this morning.</p><p>And upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is headed to  Saudi Arabia today, amid pressure to take action against the Kingdom after  it admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham telling me on Sunday Morning Futures he felt used by  the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he's open to keeping the arms  seal -- sales deal on track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it impossible to believe  that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So, go after him and his inner  circle, save they alliance.</p><p>I don't mind military sales, but I cannot do business with the current  leadership.  MBS, he's done to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus, caravan crisis, thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into Mexico  with their sights on the U.S.A.  We're going to take you live to the border  to get an update on that caravan this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and Independent Women's Voice CEO,  Heather Higgins, is here this morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Thank you </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS:  It's going to be a  hectic week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hectic week because of earnings, hectic week because of?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  GDP out on Friday.  We find out how fast this country was  growing in the third quarter and if we need more tax cuts, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  President said that on the campaigns trial on  Saturday, but it's also a huge week for earnings.  We've got technology in  the spotlight, Amazon and Alphabet may very well move markets.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, big time.  Especially because I'm looking forward to Verizon  tomorrow because they're going to talk about their 5G rollout.  They did it  in four different cities.  So, that's the way with the future.  </p><p>We'll see how much capital they need to put into that.  That's part of the  Infrastructure Bill.  Remember the President keeps talking about  infrastructure?  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, 5G is part of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The GDP number on Friday, Dagen, I guess the, you know, Atlanta  Fed was all the way up at, what, four -- better than 4.5 percent, 4.8  percent or so?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we now on that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the Wall Street Journal, in its estimate, so it was 4.2  percent in the second quarter, but the third quarter is expected to come in  at 3.4 percent in the preliminary reading.  A wide -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still a good number.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A widening trade gap could be a drag on third quarter GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Based on the Journal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  So good backdrop, Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It is now.  And they're -- the administration's really happy with  anything over three percent just because we --- they keep saying --  everybody said even three percent was impossible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  We're so happy to have anything over three percent.  That is  great.  And so -- but they're looking at these four percent plus numbers  and they're thrilled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you get the biggest week of third quarter earnings so far.   That's going to also show you some real growth.  That means like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent company, Alphabet, all setting to report along  with 10 Dow Components.</p><p>On the economic side, the highlight of the week, of course, is that GDP  report.  And in terms of what we're going to see in terms of market  expectations.  Pretty much baked in a better than three percent number?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think it is.  One of the things that has weighed on  economists has been the tariffs, and so that's why the look-through into  tech earnings this week is, what have the implications been.  </p><p>Especially when you think about Apple, they come out next week.  They  haven't updated the guidance, but they said the tariffs are a tax on  consumers.  So, how is that going to impact their phone sales, especially  because they came out with new releases?  </p><p>I think it's interesting to note that technology stocks are only valued  seven percent higher than the general market.  The market's trading about  15.9 times earnings, tech's around 16.6, but they have twice the profit  margins.</p><p>So, let's see what the guidance is coming forward.  So you saw Goldman  Sachs even came out earlier this week.  I mean, last week.</p><p>They were talking about how tech isn't overvalued and that this the selloff  has been unwarranted, but it's important to note that investors have been  rotating into safer names.</p><p>They don't think we're going to get 10, 20, 30 percent returns going  forward.  They went into consumer staples stocks.  Consumer staples stocks  are up 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Technology stocks are down 3.5 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to also watch out for, the Wall Street Journal writes  about this in today's paper.  Slowing sales growth.</p><p>So instead of earnings, because, again, if sales growth slows -- and we  have had, according to the Journal, 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies  have reported so far.  Based on our estimates, it's actually 38 percent,  miss-sales forecasts.</p><p>If sustained, that quarterly sales miss-ratio would mark the highest so far  this year.  So again, if you're coming up short on sales for whatever  reason, whether it's higher prices that you -- you're not -- that you're  trying to pass on and people aren't buying it, whatever the reason, that  doesn't bode well for earnings growth into next year.  </p><p>And sales are only growing, are expected to grow 7.3 percent, which is  slightly lower than expectations going into this quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the guidance is going to be reflecting what the  expectations are on the trade situation, right?  On tariffs.</p><p>Because if we start -- this is when we're going to know.  I mean, companies  should probably guide us toward us, \"All right, we're going to see lower  sales than expected because of the tariffs.\"</p><p>I don't know that's the case, but I would imagine this is the quarter when  we find out if, in fact, it is going to weigh on earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the most important thing that the market's going to  focus is operating margins.  They think margins are going to come down and  be compressed because several factors.  Some of them are the rising input  costs, now we're seeing inflation's going up.  </p><p>We're also seeing labor costs are going up, costs of goods are going up.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So the problem is this, how are they going to be able to maintain  that, if they're not able to get more productivity out of their workers?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  If you can pass on these higher costs, which like with  Unilever, some of the big consumer products companies, then that's good  news. The -- </p><p>I mean not ultimately to the customer, but it's good news for the companies  again, but it's -- again, the higher input costs, you can't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  For whatever reason, it's not just tariffs.  Watch a lot of  companies potentially, if they're coming up short, start to blame tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're going to have to kind of comb through the -- try and  separate the fact from the fiction.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It'll be -- </p><p>KELLY:  Also the storm, they'll see that in -- about the storms, right?  So  we -- they'll think next quarter's going to be weak because of the storms,  whatever's happening.</p><p>We've seen -- Home Depot should be strong, but they actually got a  downgrade last week because they think the consumer's not going to be as  strong in upgrading their homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, whatever weakness we see, the President's trying to  offset it now with talk of more tax cuts ahead of the election. </p><p>He spoke to reporters just this weekend about a package that they're  working on right now.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be sometime, just prior I would say to November.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, Election Day is 15 days away at this point, November  1st.  Ten days away.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He didn't say which November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, of course, you know, Congress is out of session until  after the November Elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe he comes out with an announcement before midterm  elections, but we're not going to see a vote, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  And quite frankly, the deficit is becoming -- it's starting  to become an issue for politicians and for the American people.</p><p>President Trump said \"I'm ordering all my cabinet secretaries to cut their  spending by 5 percent.  But discretionary spending is what one-third --  roughly one-third of the entire budget every year.  And if you cut out  defense, it's a cut -- I think it represents less than one percent of  overall spending.</p><p>So again, I don't -- he -- it would take -- it's a long road to plow in  terms of pushing through a tax cut at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we know they want to make the individual cut permanent and  we know that that's going to be on their agenda should they have the  opportunity, even after the midterm elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe it --I mean he said Kevin Brady is working on it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  House, Ways and Means.  So maybe it's an announcement from  House, Ways and Means before the midterms.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It could be.  They won't get anything passed.  But it's been  pretty clear that even though they passed the first tax cut, that even  though they were constrained by certain prior agreements to have the  individual cuts be temporary, the goal was always to make those be  permanent.</p><p>You are now seeing a recovery which, for the first time in a very long  time, is being led by blue-collar job growth, blue-collar wages, small  business confidence, rather than leading from the top.</p><p>It's sort of from the bottom.  And those people are going to be going into  the midterms looking at this fantastically booming economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Trump's approval ratings are now higher than Obama's were going  into his first midterms.  And his disapproval ratings have actually come  down, layering on a promised middle-class tax cuts can't hurt.</p><p>And -- because serious way, if you want to take on the deficit, and this  may be the one President who can cut through the swamp and actually get  this done, because the creatures on both sides of the aisle like the  current services baseline, economic gains that would never, ever be allowed  in the private sector in terms of automatic budget increases and claiming.  </p><p>Because, you know, they get to claim to these two different constituents  coming into their office and for the exact same thing, they get to claim  that they were either cutting it or increasing it because of the semantics  involved with the built-in increases.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  If you're serious about taking on the deficit, then have you to  be serious on taking on the financial accounting games that are played in  Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's Saudi Arabia on deck as well.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin now defending his decision to go to Saudi.  He's meeting  with Saudi officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p>He says the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at this critical moment.   He's not going to that conference, but this trip comes after Saudi Arabia  said that Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was in fact killed  in a fist fight inside the Istanbul Consulate.</p><p>The Kingdom is forcefully denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  Lawmakers, though, are showing  skepticism on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Did the Crown Prince know anything  about it?  If there were people closely tied to him involved in this  operation?</p><p>ADEL BIN AHMED AL-JUBEIR, DIPLOMAT, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:   There weren't people closely tied to him who were involved in this  operation.  This was an operation that was a rogue operation. </p><p>This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities  and responsibilities they had.</p><p>GRAHAM:  it's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to  kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it.  That would  be brazen abuse of authority.</p><p>He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in  Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will quote the Wall Street Journal editorial today on this  very issue.  Saudi Arabia needs to step up.  We still don't know -- they  haven't produced Khashoggi's body, provided more details of precisely how  or when he decide.</p><p>The story doesn't add up.  Of the 18 people arrested, five others sacked,  several a part of Mohammed bin Salman the inner circle.  It's unlikely they  would have acted alone without at least, you know, feeling a tacit assent  from the Crown Prince.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial goes on to write, \"The U.S. goal should  be to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear that  murdering journalists is unacceptable and that Mohammed bin Salman's  erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral  relationship.\"</p><p>We can't dictate what King Salman will do about who should run Saudi  Arabia, but you can -- but Mohammed bin Salman also can't be allowed to  conclude that America thinks this is no big deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they've got to do something.  The U.S. has to do  something to push back in the face of this heinous situation.</p><p>Question is, does Mohammed bin Salman survive?  He's got two other sons.   There are a lot of people who want this guy out at this point.  Lindsey  Graham included.</p><p>So big question here, you know, I mean, the arms sales is going -- it's  going to go through.  The relationship is going to go through because  there's one big black eye here that we're faced with and that is Iran, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the muddled response from this administration and the uneven  response that we've seen since this all began, we need to be on very firm  footing about the message, like Lindsey Graham said that we send to King  Salman about who we -- who should run the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  I want to disagree.  I think that the administration has been  taking a difficult situation.  These are people that behaved really badly,  like so many of the people we've had to deal with.  And they've got this  challenge of how do you negotiate making them pay for it, making them fess  up to it, but not having them lose so much for -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But comparing it to Brett Kavanaugh was a misstep.  I'm sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, it's shifting gears for FiatChrysler.  Details on the  automaker's roughly $7 billion car parts deal.  That's next.  </p><p>And then a spooky box office debut, we've got it here on Halloween.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Battle at the border for sure, a migrant caravan  moving toward the United States.  It has grown now to roughly 5,000 people.   Griff Jenkins is live in McAllen, Texas this morning with details there,  right in the middle of it.  Griff.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  When the  caravan gets to this border, if they do indeed come here, they're going to  find an overwhelmed border already with illegal crossing.  </p><p>And the Rio Grande Valley Sector where I'm standing McAllen is the busiest  sector of the entire U.S. border, and it had more than 12,700 illegal  crossing arrests in just the last three weeks.  </p><p>Over the weekend, over 800 pounds of marijuana confiscated, and it is part  of the problem here they're seeing is also family units, women and children  coming, much like the caravan of migrants from Central American countries.</p><p>We spent time yesterday with the Sector Chief, a guy named Manuel Padilla,  talking about the caravan that's coming and what he says is a need for more  infrastructure.  Take a listen.</p><p>MANUEL PADILLA, CHIEF, RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR:  If we had this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure throughout my border,  we would truly transform this area.  It's a win-win situation for  everybody.</p><p>This area right here, we do not see MS-13, we do not see criminal aliens  coming into this area, because of the capability that we have through this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure.</p><p>JENKINS:  But he's only got well and about 55 of the nearly 300 parts of  this sector and it's a busy one.  The President, Maria, will be in Houston  today and Houston is in this RGV area.  I'm sure this topic will certainly  come up.  Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins is live  McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>What a scene.  We are going to be watching that as that caravan moves  closer to where Griff is actually standing.</p><p>Switching gears, a deadly train derailment in Taiwan.  Cheryl Casone with  that right now in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, good morning.</p><p>An express train went off the tracks, killing at least 18 people.  This  happened in Eastern Taiwan.  More than 150 others were injured in this  disaster.  Witnesses say all eight of the train's carriages went off the  rails as it was traveling to the eastern city of Taitung.</p><p>This comes a year after another express train on the same line derailed.   The cause of yesterday's accident, under investigation.</p><p>Well, Fiat Chrysler is unloading its car parts business.  The company is  selling the unit to Japan's Calsonic Kansei for just over $7 billion.   Calsonic is owned by the U.S. private-equity firm, KKR.  The deal is going  to make the newly-combined company one of the world's biggest auto parts  suppliers.</p><p>The FiatChrysler- - excuse me -- in the premarket up 4.6 percent, about.</p><p>And then finally, there is this.  The horror movie, \"Halloween,\" making a  killing at the box office this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this  night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been preparing for this for a long time. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is not safe to be on the streets tonight.  Go  home!  Get out of here!  Get inside!  Michael?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The film raking in $77.5 million, a record opening for the  franchise.  It also is the second-best October opening weekend of all time. </p><p>Holding on to second place, in its third weekend, \"A Star Is Born,\" $19.3  million.  </p><p>Rounding out top five, last week's big winner was \"Venom,\" followed by \"  Goosebumps 2:  Haunted Halloween,\" and, Maria, \"First Man.\"  </p><p>Jamie Curtis, she's still got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she does.  Good movies this weekend.  Thanks, Cheryl. </p><p>Coming up, a new way to calculate your FICO score, we will tell you why  your cash may help.  That's next.</p><p>And then Facebook goes shopping.  The technology giant's reported plan to  purchase a cybersecurity company, all right here after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Increasing access to credit, Fair Isaac, the  company behind the FICO score, is rolling out a major change, UltraFICO  Score will go beyond payment history.</p><p>According to the Journal this morning, it will factor in bank account  activity, how consumers manage their cash and checking, savings and money  market accounts.  It launches next year. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Mark Hamrick.  He's  Bankrate.com's Senior Economic Analyst.  </p><p>And Mark, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining  us.  </p><p>MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think this is about younger people, this new FICO  change.  Tell us about it.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Primarily, and we think about the fact that there's a large  portion of the U.S. population which really isn't doing business with  traditional financial service companies.  Millennial have been smart.   They're saving more money.</p><p>Our recent Bankrate survey found that about two-thirds of the American  public was essentially limiting its spending and millennials are doing the  best job of saving more money so that money is sitting in accounts not  necessarily being spent.</p><p>At Bankrate, we say that the two biggest problems that have been identified  by Americans is their failure to save for retirement and for emergencies.   So, financial companies want to create new customers and help connect them  to borrowing products.  It's a logical step for them.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there a way to opt out of this?  It's -- the last thing I want  with the Equifax hacking and everything going on about security, the last  thing I want is somebody to pull up my UltraFICO to see how much money --  cash I have in a bank account, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how you're managing all your money, and all your accounts.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Savings, checking.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes.  Well, to the question, I think you're right on.  I think  Americans are tired of having their personal information essentially taken  from them.  </p><p>And I think this is going to be something to watch in terms of regulation  in the coming years, whether it's the information that Facebook and Google  possess about us or our credit rating scores, because I think we have a  sense that we have no control over this information.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the -- with the -- this new FICO score, is this a way  to essentially offer people even more credit, if you will, that this is at  a time when people are increasingly stretched, that you've seen auto  lending particularly on the fringes of people with very low subprime auto  lending really being pulled back on?  </p><p>Is this a way to basically shine up people's credit scores and make them  more palatable to the lender?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  That's a very good question.  I think that is essentially the  tension that could be created by this.  In other words, giving loans to  people who are not well qualified. </p><p>But that, I don't think, is the intention.  Most financial service firms  are not looking to create new losses.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell has said that he thinks that household balance sheets are  in good shape.  He's more concerned about the commercial side.</p><p>So, I think this is more about trying to identify good data about consumers  and potential borrowers and connecting them to products that they might  find useful.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Meanwhile, you've got a new survey on how Americans are spending,  and if they're cutting back on spending, right?  Let's talk about that.  </p><p>Sixty-six percent say that they're living -- they're limiting spending,  thirty-six percent say that they are doing it to save money.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes, and I think this is a good thing.  As I said, you know, I  don't think there are many Americans that go essentially into their last  days saying, \"You know what, I saved too much money.\"  Ii think more  Americans regret that they didn't do a better job of saving for retirement  or emergencies.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And I think that 36 percent was only of the 66 percent that were  saving.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So it was only 24 percent overall that we're saving for longer  term.</p><p>The other thing that was interesting in the study was, there has long been  a contention that the big difference between how well you do in life is how  long your time horizon is.</p><p>And when you looked at the study, the people who were making over $50,000  clearly had a longer time horizon that they were saving for, whereas the  people who were under that were just sort of saving for the short-term  needs and they weren't thinking beyond that.</p><p>How, if we're going to move away from the Keynesian mentality, that the  more debt you have and the more spending you have, the better off we all  are, to one where people are more prudent and thinking about their savings,  how is borrowing going to help that happen?</p><p>HAMRICK:  I think essentially, it's two different questions.  I think the  first question is, as long as you have a healthy economy, most Americans  will be mindful of trying to achieve proper financial goals.</p><p>I do think in our society, we have a significant problem with lack of  financial literacy and that's an education issue, which i don't hear a lot  of people talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's too bad.  It really just starts at home.  But we're  certainly interested in that.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you this morning.  Mark Hamrick joining us from  Bankrate.com.  </p><p>Take a short break.  When we come back, Jamie Dimon's big bet, why J.P.  Morgan is building a campus in Silicon Valley.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then fixing traffic gridlock, details on Elon Musk's high-speed transit  tunnel.  It's nearly finished.  Will it offer free rides to the public?  We  will tell you about that.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, October  22nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  The major  indices on Wall Street looking to open higher this morning ahead of a big  week for earnings.  This right here is the high of the morning, up 73  points on the Dow Industrials, a quarter of a percent.  The NASDAQ is up  two-thirds of a percent, that's 42 points higher.  This after a mixed close  on Friday, all ahead of a big week in earnings.  This is one of the busiest  weeks we're going to see.  </p><p>Dow Industrials, on Friday, up 65 points at the close, a quarter of a  percent higher.  The S&amp;P500 was flat, down one point; and the NASDAQ was  lower by half a percent, 36 points lower on NASDAQ on Friday.  In Europe  this morning, take a look at indices, higher across the board.  FT-100 up  two-thirds of one percent; CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent;  and the DAX Index in Germany, up two-thirds of one percent right now.   Asian markets closed higher overnight.  The Shanghai Composite was up  strong, up four percent.  China's government revealing tax cuts over the  weekend to help boost that economy which has shown slowdown.  </p><p>Facebook is eyeing, shoring up its security.  The company reportedly  looking to make an acquisition in cyber sector.  Plus, the company faces  request a from Japan to beef up security.  Building the future.  Details on  JPMorgan Chase's newest investment in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you  what's behind that move.  And then a rare -- a rare reality.  Elon Musk  tweeting out date for his hyperloop transport.  When you can expect to take  a ride on a high-speed rail, from Elon Musk?  And forget getting candies in  your trick or treat bags.  We've got the very list of the U.S. cities  spending the most on Halloween this year -- it might surprise you.  </p><p>First though, our top story this half an hour.  Countdown to midterm  elections now 15 days away.  President Trump and former President Obama  squaring off in dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  President Trump will hit the campaign trail  in Houston in support of Ted Cruz, while former President Obama will  touchdown in Las Vegas and campaign there.  Enthusiasm for President Trump  is high, lines of supporters are already covering entire blocks as nearly  100,000 people wait to enter venue that can hold 18,000.  18,000 is what  the capacity is.  </p><p>Yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham to get his take on the most important issues on the ballot  this November.  President Trump has hand-picked Senator Graham to go out  and campaign for colleagues.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM:  I think people are going to be voting on the mob rule of the  Democratic Party.  If you like Democrats around the House, you know exactly  what you're going to get: They're going to try and impeach the president,  impeach Kavanaugh; they don't care about your wallet, they just want to get  in your wallet.  </p><p>If you keep Republicans in charge, we're going to keep the economy moving  forward, we're going to secure our border, we're going to deal with our  enemies throughout the world, we're going to rebuild our military.  And  when it comes to standing up to the world, you need a strong leader like  President Trump, and the Democratic Party has showed us what they would do  with power, not much for you.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the president has asked Lindsey Graham to go on the road;  he's going to talk -- he's going to be in 13 cities in just a couple of  days.  Joining us right now is Republican Strategist Kimberly Klacik.   Kimberly, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.   Your reaction to Senator Graham and what you might expect from him in the  next couple of days as he travels to 13 cities to campaign?  </p><p>KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I see this new Lindsey Graham that  we've been seeing, I expect good things.  I mean, he's absolutely right.   You know exactly what you're going to get if the Democrats take over the  House.  They have been intolerant lately.  The mob -- the mob name actually  fits them properly.  And I think for a lot of people, we don't really  understand whether or not there is a blue wave coming.  I'm not convinced.   In 2016, everyone said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, we saw that  Trump won and that's basically because people were afraid to show support  for Trump, so I don't think we really know what's going to happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's new line lately in his campaigns have been  \"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.\"  We saw that mob- thinking again this weekend when Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao  were harassed while they were at dinner, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and there was a panel in MSNBC that essentially justifies  this kind of behavior base on the fact that Merrick Garland didn't get a  vote in front of the Senate under Mitch McConnell.  That was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's justified.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, that that's justified.  And they're -- the message from  the Democrats is \"we are coming for you.\"  If you support Trump, we're  going to show up at your place of work, where you eat, where you live.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you deny that's not the mob?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is the mob.  I think that that's a great slogan.  He's --  President Trump is also really focused on immigration, attention to the  border wall, and in fact, I know that Joe Donnelly who is a Democrat  running for election in Indiana has actually running ads promoting his  support of President Trump on immigration -- border wall.  And radical left  talking about abolishing ICE.  So, smart Democrats like Donnelly in  Indiana, they know that this is an important issue to Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because -- and then you've got Kevin McCathy bringing the  bill to the floor right after midterms, Kimberly, to build the wall,  enforce the law -- act, that's what it is.  And voter interest in this  election has surged today record highs in both parties.  A new Wall Street  Journal/NBC News poll finds that nearly two-thirds of registered voters say  they are very interested in this year's midterms, that's the highest ever  recorded by the survey.  President Trump's job approval rating, as we just  heard, got a boost, the poll finds that approval rating now at 47 percent.   This is the highest of his time in office, Kimberly, going into these  midterm elections, what are your thoughts?  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, and it's well deserved.  You see, President Trump -- I don't  think the Democrats have identified that he's done anything wrong.  You  have to remember, usually, Democrats run on making promises, usually  promises they can't keep.  And so, right now, you have a bunch of problems  that Trump is solving on his own.  People were talking about immigration  and they should, because this is really a threat on our national security.   It's not about not wanting people to come in and live for the American  dream.  So, yes, they are absolutely right about this, and I think that is  why there's overwhelming support right now for President Trump, because  there's a lot of people on his side here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you know, Heather, when you look at these pictures of  this caravan making its way to the United States, it is just perfect timing  going into the midterm elections because it's a reminder that the president  is trying to secure the borders and have legal immigration.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  The caravan is the single largest one picture argument for a wall  that Trump could have ever asked for.  And particularly, when you see the  soldiers in Guatemala or the police there trying to stop it and getting  overrun on the fences, getting overrun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HIGGINS:  What's interesting about the poll that just came out, I've been  saying from the beginning that there was not going to be a blue wave and  that the Republicans, actually, I will predict will keep the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  And the poll has been interesting in that is now down to a nine- point Democrat advantage in the generic, but if you look in the  battleground states, it is completely even now.  I think, I think it is not  going to be the blue wave, I think it's going to be a major red wall, and  there's going to be more pick-ups in the Senate as well as holding of the  House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know I'm talking out both sides in my mouth, one problem,  though, in President Trump making immigration a front and center issue,  talking about the wall is the fact that the Republicans in control of the  Senate and the House didn't fully fund his wall, and they didn't basically  starve the sanctuary cities of money.  This is another can that's been  kicked down the road after midterms, so in some way, he's highlighting what  the Republicans haven't gotten done, but they haven't fulfilled agenda on  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Exactly.  This has been the biggest problem that Republicans have  had to overcome is their failure to follow through on things that they  promised to do, whether it was health care or taking on sanctuary cities or  border wall funding, I think part of the reason that you saw the tremendous  lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters until the Kavanaugh hearings was  that there was this disjunction, what had been promised versus what had  been delivered in the general sense of why would I bother voting for you?   Kavanaugh made it very clear why you would bother voting for them because  the alternative was much worse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, now, Donald Trump just gave them another reason and that's  tax cut 2.0.  So, if you think about it, no better way to mobilize people  to vote than tell them you're going to do tax cut 2.0 a couple of weeks  before election.  So, I think that timing was perfect and he's now throwing  the Democrats in a (INAUDIBLE), because he's going to make them start  talking about taxes and has done very well for Republicans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: And let not forget -- let's not forget, Kimberly, not one  Democrat voted for that tax cut plan.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, that's true.  So, how much are they really for the American  people?  I think that right now this is the perfect storm, like you said  the caravan coming is the perfect storm.  We have to remember, do we really  want people in our country, as the first thing they do when they get here  is break our laws?  We are a nation of laws and we deserve to know who our  neighbors are, and we should be vetting legal immigrants.  I think,  honestly, I don't see the blue wave either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kimberly, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kimberly Klacik joining us there.  Coming up, doubling down on  data protection, details on Facebook's reported plans to purchase a  cybersecurity company, that's next.  And then getting into the Halloween  spirit, we will tell you the city spending the most money on Halloween  ahead of October 31.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New pressure this morning on Facebook over data  protection, Cheryl Casone on it in headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, the Japanese government has ordered Facebook to better  protect user data.  Japan's asking the company to fully communicate  security issues to its users and inform regulators of any change in  security measures.  This, of course, comes after Facebook said earlier this  month, hackers stole information of about 30 million people.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly planning to go buy a major cybersecurity  firm.  Reports say Facebook has approached several companies for a  potential acquisition.  Taking a look at shares of the company down 13  percent so far this year, there's Facebook.  </p><p>Well, JPMorgan Chase is planning to build a new campus that's going to  focus on Fintech or Financial Technology.  This campus is going to be out  in Silicon Valley.  More than 1,000 employees are going to work at the  campus when it opens up in Palo Alto in 2020.  A project part of an effort  by JPMorgan to keep up with changes in digital payments which is big  business.  Most of the employers are going to work for JPMorgan Chase's  merchant services division.  Shares of JPMorgan are up nearly one percent  so far this year.  </p><p>And Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry in the United States.   So, this year, Americans are expected to spend $9 billion on candy,  costumes, decorations.  That works out to an average 86 bucks per person.   And 24/7 Wall Street created an index to see which cities actually spend  the most on Halloween.  And this year, the top of the list: Number one,  Phoenix; right behind it, L.A., Honolulu, Burbank, and Paradise, Nevada.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money on candy and Halloween stuff.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's a lot of yummy candy, that's all I can say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, are we going to have some Halloween candy onset at some  point?  </p><p>CASONE:  I'm working on it.  You know I'm on that.  You read my mind. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I figured there were some story around that.  That can get some  chocolate up here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whole Foods sells vegan candy corn.  I found that yesterday.   Quite delicious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one.  Good info.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why Phoenix is number one the list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>KELLY:  Because of my sister, she goes by Pauline Halloween, and she makes  it the whole month and she spends -- I mean, this is her Super Bowl.  This  is, like, what she lives for every year.  So, I can -- that explains.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was surprised its Phoenix.  I don't know why.  </p><p>KELLY:  I'm not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of decorations here in New York are pretty funny.  People  get into it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  My kids are now, all three, simultaneously in college, but it  wasn't too long ago where the house was decorated stem to stern and we put  in a haunted house and all the rest of it.  And now, all of that stuff  stays in the basement because we're not at trick or treat age.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A very young French girl in my building told me that she's going  as one of the pink ladies, and she said, do you know who the pink ladies  are?  And I went, my dear, I saw Greece when it was released, at drive-in  movie theater.  And she went, what's a driving --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>KELLY:  That's amazing.</p><p>HIGGINS:  That is funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, going  underground.  Elon Musk's infrastructure firm, the Boring Company gearing  up to unveil its first high-speed transit tunnel.  Details on the launch  right after this.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk out with new details about his high- speed hyperloop transport.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.   Lauren, good morning. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good morning, we have a date and we have a place.  So, this is  what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend: \"First tunnel almost done.\"  And  then he responded to a follower on Twitter, when: Well, \"opens December  10th.\"  His Boring Company on December 11th, will then take the public on  free rides of a tunnel track.  </p><p>Check this out, which will run in Hawthorne, California from SpaceX --  another one of Musk's company -- it's North 200th Street, then west from  there for about two miles.  It uses a loop system, which transports a car  or a vehicle, as you can see on platform, which they called the skate and  it basically skates you 150 miles an hour to your destination, no traffic,  no speeding ticket.  </p><p>When Musk first announced the boring company back in 2016 because he was  bored sitting in traffic, most people thought he was nuts.  But once again,  the visionary CEO making due on pie in the sky idea and inviting the public  to try it out for free and that maybe his way of faring well in the court  of public opinion because at least two of his tunnels face lawsuits.  </p><p>In California, they're worried about environment and what tunneling in  seismic-prone areas could do to residents' homes.  Now, Musk is also  working on a tunnel from Dodger's stadium to a nearby train station -- but  that one will not be opened for the World Series.  I know a lot of people  would appreciate that as we gear up for the big games tomorrow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  I think it's going to be great.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  An electric subterranean train station, essentially.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but the real question is, can my face be pulled back?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, he promised that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, I'm dead serious.  His follower said, is this is going to  be like a really cool disco-like experience?  And he said, yes, so there's  going to be something cool happening in those tunnels -- it's kind of scary  if you ask me.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So, when exactly are you trying out if the tunnels aren't yet  built?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, this would be taking someone -- the two or three miles to  the destination.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  OK.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, they're actually going to put people in that tunnel near  Hawthorne, California.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does anybody think Elon Musk is doing too much, given that you  have a publicly traded auto company that's struggling, largely in part  because of your own shenanigans?  So, maybe you ought to focus on one  thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with all of that, he's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But he's also delivering.  And then someone asked him, is he  going to be done in Elon time or real-time, and he said, I hope real-time,  but yes, he has his hands in many baskets but he is delivering on this, and  especially in Los Angeles where the traffic is terrible.  Look, this could  be the future of transportation and the future might be here and now or at  least the start of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you listen to that Joe Rogan podcast, the whole thing, he  clearly is, like, the permitting process is impossible in Los Angeles,  right?  And so, to act like this is going to solve the problems of  commuters in Los Angeles is a bit farfetched.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But they don't have a good metro station there.  </p><p>KELLY:  I would rather ride this than go on SpaceX to Mars, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My point is that, well, you know what, you're going to be able  to go to Mars before you can drive around to L.A. in a tunnel.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't know.  What do you guys think will happen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's going to take time --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Decades.  Centuries. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- with the regulations.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's gotten exemptions from certain authorities to do the test  tubes of this, if you will, but you're right.  Now, they do have to come  through with the overall permitting process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Lauren, thank you.  Coming up,  still ahead, battle at the border, details on the migrant caravan with over  5,000 people in it approaching the United States, that's next hour right  here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.

President Trump says he  wants to get something done before November -- that's eight days from now.   What it means ahead of the midterm elections to hear such an announcement.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.   Great to see you this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Nice to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to start the week off  with thinking there will be new tax cuts, right -- tax cuts 2.0, making  things permanents.  That's a great way to start the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It's an excellent way to go into the midterms.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump is trying to  get that economy, because that's his strongest issue -- number one in the  eyes of voters.  Because the latest Fox News poll, it was actually health  care.  And Republicans are a little bit back on their heels on the health  care issue.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  That's why he's been talking about pre-existing conditions too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because they're running -- 50 percent of the ads that  Democrats are running are about health care.  And many of them focusing on  pre-existing conditions and trying to message that Republicans want to  remove those protections.</p><p>But in terms of the polling -- 47 percent approval rating for the President  according to the new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll -- his highest during his  time in office.  The enthusiasm gap has closed to 4 percentage points,  that's a very small advantage for the Democrats.</p><p>And to Heather's point earlier, \"The Cook Report\", nonpartisan, finds that  parties are dead even on the question of who should control Congress in  districts rated as the most competitive -- dead even.  And there was a 13  percentage point advantage for the Democrats just in the last month's poll  among registered voters.  So that advantage has disappeared.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why.  I saw an ad this weekend.  It's like do you  want Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house?  And I was like no.  I  was like -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Maxine Waters running the Financial Services  Committee?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Elijah Cummings or Jerry Nadler running the  Judiciary?  </p><p>KELLY:  That's the best ad.  It's like ok, you don't have to like us.  You  just don't want them to be in control of the House.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  In fact, when I wrote the piece publicly predicting that Trump  was going to win, when he was at his nadir that August, I said what's going  to happen to Republican voters even those who don't like how Trump talks  and don't like other things about him, they're going to look at the  alternative of what Hillary would mean in terms of continued policies, et  cetera.  And they're going to hold their noses and they're going to vote  for Trump and join the people who were voting for him.</p><p>And the same thing is going to happen with these midterm elections.  While  the spin is being put on it, which is not incorrect, that if the  Republicans lose the House, this creates a fantastic foil for Trump and  almost guarantees re-election in 2020.</p><p>The reality is, is that he wants a Republican Congress because he's running  on fulfilling his promises and getting things done, which is also going to  make him impossible to beat in 2020.  What you're seeing in the polls is  exactly what all of our work, all this year was.</p><p>And we kept saying to the Republicans, the economy alone is not going to be  your winning issue.  You're going to get really taken to the cleaners by  the left on health care and on your supposed cruelty on immigration and you  better be prepared.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks like the President at this point is expecting Biden to  be on the other side of the podium in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's at the top of polls in terms of Democratic contenders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the President now has a name for him -- 1 percent, Joe -- 1  percent or something else.  The name came out this weekend.  You knew that.   Ok, well this is who the President is taking serious.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It's also the public said this because Biden is the best known  name, right, in their heads in terms of presidential aspiration.  Over time  that's going to shift.  Biden tends to want to be anointed, not to actually  have to work for things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He also has historically had a lot of trouble fund raising.  So  that is to his disadvantage in terms of running for the Democratic  nomination -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which is what keeps Nancy Pelosi front and center in the  party.  She's a great fundraiser.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  Phenomenal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- something else walks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- actually something else actually talks too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Our top story this hour is the looming crisis at the border --  another issue for the midterm elections.  The migrant caravan from Honduras  has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.  It  crossed into Mexico over the weekend and it sets up a potential showdown at  the U.S. border where President Trump says he will use the military if  necessary to stop these people from coming in.</p><p>Here now is Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman -- thanks  very much for joining us.</p><p>First, let me get your thoughts on this migrant caravan, your reaction to  this.  What should the U.S. do?  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well first of all, Maria -- good  morning to everyone.</p><p>This is indicative of the fact that the situation at the border is and has  been chaotic.  We've been saying this for years.  It's critical that the  United States secure its border, build the wall, get other technology to  make sure that our borders are safe and secure.</p><p>And this is an intolerable situation.  We cannot have throngs of people  just coming across porous borders.  It's a crisis that needs to be dealt  with now.  And it needs to be dealt with in the future.  That's why we've  got to secure our border.  That's why we've got to build the wall and make  sure that our southern border is safe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your colleague, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is  introducing a bill that would fully fund the President's border wall.  You  were an original co-sponsor of the bill.  Is its going to pass the house?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Sure, it will definitely pass the House.  Of course, the  arduous task has been always the Senate, the Senate the Senate.  But yes,  it will pass the House.  It's an important bill.  It gives what we wanted,  what the President wanted to fully fund the border wall.</p><p>But also, to make sure that we have other technology because it's very  important to realize that the wall can be built in certain areas but there  are other areas where the wall can't be built.  We have to use other  advanced technologies to make sure that we keep the illegal immigration  from coming across.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how much -- Kevin McCarthy says that this bill funds $23  billion, which is what's needed for the border wall because $1.5 billion  has already been accounted for.</p><p>But this weekend when I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked him  will it pass the Senate, he goes the Senate has $5 billion towards the  border wall.  He ignored the $23 billion that Kevin McCarthy is talking  about.  So where's the disconnect?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, the disconnect clearly is that the President and the  House have a much easier task to pass what they need.  The Senate, because  of the numbers, they need to get to 60, have had a lesser number. </p><p>I will say this.  If we get the McCarthy bill passed, and I think we will  in the House, it will give the Senate particularly this year an opportunity  to sit down and get that done and build the wall in a much more robust way.</p><p>Let's face it.  We did start with $5 billion, that's a start.  I actually  sit on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee and that's very important to me.  It's important  to our subcommittee.  I think it's important to most Americans.  We're  seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really  anarchistic the border situation has become.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the bottom line here in terms of the economic  proposals out of the administration.  Over the weekend, the President said  that another round of tax cuts is in the works aimed at the middle class.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be some time just prior I would say to November.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the status of this legislation?  I mean, you know, the  House is on -- out on recess until the midterms.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we'll be back in November, hopefully looking forward to  a new Republican majority in both houses; but having said that it's very  important to realize that the first round of tax cuts was very important.   We had to get corporate done.  We did.  That's making America competitive  again.  We put more money in the hands of hard-working Americans.</p><p>But we need to refine it now.  Obviously it was so important to get tax  reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually very  sad.  And I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.  </p><p>This was a very good bill the first time.  We're just going to make it  better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  But I mean the economy is growing well. </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 4.25 percent.  There's increasing worries  about the deficit.  Do we need another tax cut plan right now?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, when you look at it as an aggregate, as I've always  said, you reduce tax rates on everyone, more money actually comes into the  Treasury.  Why?  You incentivize work.  You incentivize investment.   Whether you're John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump, you realize  lower taxes means ultimately more money for the Treasury.  And I think  that's a good thing.</p><p>When we talk about deficits, we actually have to look at the spending side  of the equation and sadly really no one wants to look at that right now,  especially on the mandatory side of the equation.  Ultimately, I hope we  get there.</p><p>But if we don't have a taxing problem in America, we have a spending  problem in America.  So right now, more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans is good for the economy and good for the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Saudi Arabia and the U.S.- Saudi relations on  the line.  Secretary Mnuchin is traveling to Saudi today.  Some lawmakers  are calling for some harsh penalties against the Kingdom over its role  killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>I spoke with Senate Armed Services Committee member Lindsey Graham  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  Here's his take.  Listen to this --  Congressman.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  I'd like  to punish those involved.  The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment,  sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this.  And I find it  impossible to believe that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So go after  him and his inner circle.</p><p>Save the alliance.  I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business  with the current leadership, MBS.  He's done to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Congressman?  Does MBS, the Crown Prince  need to step down?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, first of all, let me commend President Trump.  He's  handled this crisis very well.  He demanded facts, he's getting facts.   We're getting into the investigation right now.</p><p>But his response to this and he's withholding judgment on the final  punishment -- and I think that's very smart.  Looking at it this way --  Saudi Arabia is a key actor in the Middle East.  This was a tragedy.  We  can't say it any other way.  It should not have happened.  It's an  atrocity, what happened to this journalist.  </p><p>However, we have to make sure that the punishment or the sanction fits what  they did and punishes the people who are accountable, who actually did  this.  Having said that, Saudi Arabia just made a major military purchase  from the United States, they are a key actor, if you will, a key check on  Iran and other countries in the region who have been aberrant lately.  So  we've got to have a reasoned response.</p><p>And I think President Trump has handled this perfectly.  He's looking at  it.  He's concerned about it.  He's condemned it.  But he's going to make  sure that the punishment fits the crime.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in the midterms -- Congressman, in terms  of how this plays out, 15 days away?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I'm optimistic.  Let's face it.  The Senate is trending up  very well in our great state of Tennessee.  Marsha Blackburn in a key state  is going to do very well.  I think she's going to win.  Looking across the  map, the Senate's in very good shape.</p><p>A month ago I was extremely concerned about the House.  Those competitive  House seats, though, have moved much tighter.  It's gone very well.  I  think we're going to hold the House.  It's razor-thin.</p><p>But I think Independents are going to see that the Democratic Party has  really gone off the rails.  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, like the  Republican Party, used to at least play on the same field.  The Democrats  sadly have jettisoned so far to the left -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  -- that I think the American people need to cure this and I  think Independents will do that and come out and vote for Republicans.  My  prediction -- we will hold the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Rod Rosenstein under fire, what House Judiciary  Chairman Bob Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from the deputy  attorney general when he testifies on Wednesday.</p><p>Then steal a base, win a taco -- how you can win free food during the World  Series, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>An intense manhunt is underway this morning after a police officer is shot  and killed in Georgia.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well Maria -- one suspect is  already under arrest in the death of 30-year-old officer Antoine Tony.   Police say tony and other officers were responding to calls of a suspicious  vehicle.  When the officers found that car, shots were fired from inside  and one of those shots hit Tony.  Police are now searching for 18-year-old  Tafahree Maynard, wanted for murder.</p><p>Forty-two police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year.   That's already seven more than all of last year.</p><p>Well, U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is in Moscow this week for  what's expected to be some pretty tense talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin and other officials over U.S. plans to pull out of a nuclear  arms treaty.  The Kremlin says President Trump's decision is a cause for  deep concern.  It would make the world a more dangerous place.</p><p>Senator Rand Paul on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" says withdrawing from the treaty is  a bad idea.  .</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple  of months ago.  And they still regard this, this reduction of nuclear arms  and the disaster that would be nuclear war.  I don't want to see another  nuclear arms race with Russia or with any other country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the U.S. claims that Russia has violated the agreement which  forbids the use of intermediate and short range rockets.  The Kremlin  adding the U.S. has not formally communicated its intentions to leave the  treaty to Russia.</p><p>And then there is this.  Papa John's founder, John Schnatter requesting the  company, amend its poison pill plan.  Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in  the company but he's prohibited from buying more stock until July of 2019  under a poison pill plan put in place by the board of directors.  Well  Schnatter was ousted, you may remember as chairman back in July after  racially-charged comments he made on a conference call leaked out to the  press.</p><p>Here's the stock.  Shares of Papa John's are down about 7 percent so far  this year.  And Maria -- as you can see on the chart, the pressure has been  on that stock as Schnatter's troubles have increased.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.</p><p>All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a shakeup at CBS, the details as interim chairman, Richard  Parsons, is stepping down from the board now just a few weeks after  entering.</p><p>Then Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings -- we break down  those numbers.  As you can see, Hasbro now down 9 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are higher ahead of the open this morning.  Investors are bracing  for the biggest week of third quarter earnings yet this week.</p><p>Dow Industrials up better than 90 points ahead of all of these earnings  coming out, a third of a percent.  We've got big names like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet -- all set to report.  Those are Nasdaq  companies.  And the Nasdaq is up this morning as you see all the numbers  coming out from a number of companies -- Caterpillar, McDonald's, also  market movers there.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about that is Wells Fargo senior global equity  strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- it's good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us this morning.</p><p>What are your expectations for earnings and heading into the earnings  season, is it priced in to markets?  </p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Well, Maria --  good morning.</p><p>And I think what really people want to know, what the market wants to know  is -- we know these earnings are going to be good overall -- 20 percent,  maybe a little bit more than that.  But I think what the market really  wants to hear about is what's going to happen in 2019 because clearly  earnings growth in 2019 is going to be nowhere near what it is this year.</p><p>And then of course, you know, what's the cost?  What are these tariffs  doing to costs?  Is there wage pressure?  Anything that affects margins.   So I think that's what's really more important than the absolute results  because, you know, we know they're going to be good results.  </p><p>KELLY:  Scott -- it's pretty interesting what's happening in the market  right now and that's obviously the dislocations seem to be about one of  those costs and that's the rising cost of capital, right, going up.</p><p>But to me, it doesn't seem like the Fed is really, you know, making a  mistake here, given that inflation's up about 2.5 percent over the last 12  months but their Fed funds rate is still below that, so it's negative on  real terms.</p><p>Where do you see the Fed going next year?  Where do you see rates going?   And how is that going to impact where the market goes for the next year?   Because it seems if we're only up 4 percent so far this year, could we have  another year next year where it's only up a couple percent?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think, you know, as far as our fixed income group, they're  looking for a hike in December which I think the Fed is certainly directing  the market toward that.  They're also looking for three more next year, so  basically between now and the end of 2019, looking for four more hikes.</p><p>From an equity strategy point of view, we think that that -- you know,  that's really -- you're kind of at the red line and I think the market is  going to be very sensitive to any hint or conversation or enthusiasm out of  Jay Powell that, you know, hey, we might increase the pace here, which I  think would -- the market would not take very well.</p><p>Now, as far as the S&amp;P 500 right now, at least based on our analysis,  stocks are pretty close to fair value.  Our year-end target has been 2800  to 2900.  We're just a touch below there.  And I think probably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, you could see the S&amp;P 500 -- let's call  it 8 percent higher than where we are now.</p><p>So even though we think stocks are pretty fairly valued right now, still  think there's some upside here, still think the bull market is not over.   We still want to lean towards those sectors that are sensitive to a  continuation of the recovery.  We don't want our clients hiding right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott-- it's Dagen McDowell.  What do you make of the \"Wall  Street Journal\" highlights slowing sales growth and how that's a major head  wind for the markets?  Noting that third quarter sales are expected to be  up 7.3 percent from the same period last year, this is for the S&amp;P 500.   But that is the lowest rate for the S&amp;P in four quarters. </p><p>And Lindsey Bell has been on this program and voiced her concerns as well  about that.  </p><p>WREN:  You know, Dagen-- last quarter I have to say we were looking for  about -- in the second quarter we were looking for about 8 percent growth  and it came in close to 10 percent.  So our number for this third quarter  reporting season was 8 percent and we're a touch below that.</p><p>So, you know, I would consider really anything, you know, at this point in  the cycle, anything you know, 6 to 8 percent maybe 9 -- 6 to 9 percent  earnings growth or revenue growth, rather, I think that's good.  And I  think next year you'll probably see something at the lower end of that  range.</p><p>But I think that's what the market expects.  It's probably priced in and  really, you know, 7 percent or 8 percent earnings growth in the third  quarter I don't really think that's going to bother investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would put new money to work right here then, Scott?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely -- Maria.  You know, we're going to open this morning  basically sitting right on the 200 day moving average.  And we closed below  it a time or two over the last couple of weeks.  But right now I think  you're at a point where if you have money on the sidelines, you need to  start legging in.  And if we trade a little bit lower here, you should  continue to do that.</p><p>So if you have a certain amount of money, you know, at these levels, put a  third of it in and if we go a little bit lower, step in with another third  because if you think as I do that a trade war is unlikely, that we're going  to continue to see decent international growth that's based on what our  economists are looking at, we're going to see decent growth here in the  U.S., then the forward fundamentals look pretty good.  And we want our  clients stepping in here and getting exposure if they have cash on the  sidelines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Scott -- we'll be watching.  Thanks so much.  Scott  Wren -- </p><p>WREN:  All right.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us there from Wells Fargo.</p><p>Coming up, a college party turns into a nightmare -- The latest  developments after the floor collapses, injuring at least 30 people.</p><p>Then, demanding answers, what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein this upcoming Wednesday when Rosenstein testifies.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 22nd.   Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>A higher start for the week for stock prices.  Take a look, markets are at  the highs right now, Dow Industrials set to open up about 100 points this  morning, that's almost one half of one percent higher.  NASDAQ is up three- quarters of a percent right now, that's the high of the morning, up 54  points on the NASDAQ.  And the S&amp;P is off third of a percent, 10 points  higher.  </p><p>This after a mixed day on Friday for the major indices at the close.  The  DowIndustrials were up 65 points, a quarter of a percent.  But the NASDAQ  was lower and the S&amp;P was also down one point on the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look, markets are seeing some gains here as  well.  FT-100 up almost one percent, 59 points higher.  CAC Quarante in  Paris up a half a percent, 23 points higher.  DAX Index in Germany up two- thirds of one percent, 77 points higher.  </p><p>Asian markets also closed higher overnight, China was the best performer,  Shanghai Composite up better than four percent.

The interview will be closed --  will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will be  transcribed.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte telling me  yesterday in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" what  investigators are looking for specifically.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We want to  know in particular about the new developments that we've been made aware of  about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees  and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the  president of the United States.  His boss, the chief executive officer of  our country.  </p><p>And the possibility of pulling together cabinet members to invoke the 25th  Amendment to the United States constitution which would be a mechanism to  declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice  president presumably serving in his place.  </p><p>These are very, very serious allegations.  We have all of this based upon a  newspaper report and we have third party testimony that we've heard in our  investigation.  We know he's met with President Trump.  President Trump has  been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two  at the Department of Justice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOODLATTE:  But the Congress has oversight responsibility so we're going to  ask him about those questions along with many other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial an analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  You only --  good morning.  You almost can't make this up really when you -- when you  think about it.  The people that Congressman Goodlatte's folks have  interviewed were not in the room when deputy attorney general Rosenstein  said this.  He doesn't seem to be much of as it be whether or not he said  it.  He says it was sarcastic.  Three people in the room say it was  sarcastic.  One person in the room, Andrew McCabe, fired from the FBI for  lying, said I interpret it seriously.  </p><p>The president either isn't worried about it or is biding his time until  after the midterm elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's more that's going to be on the -- on the  table obviously on Wednesday with Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goodlatte is also looking to get to the bottom of what was said  to the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When they actually applied for a warrant to wiretap someone who  worked with the Trump campaign which of course is Carter Page.  And what  we've heard now from John Ratcliffe as well as Congressman Goodlatte is  that the Obama administration officials withheld information to the FISA  court in order to get that warrant.  Here's Bob Goodlatte on that issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  There's a lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements  and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that.  He came into this matter at  the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal  of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court in  secret to approve a wiretap on an individual, who's a United States citizen  and this went on for a full year.  The last three months of which Mr.  Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.  So we have questions for  him about that and we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, judge?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, I've been a very harsh critic for FISA for a  long time.  In my view, it is a corrupt way for the Justice Department to  use the lower FISA standard, probable cause of communicating with a foreign  person as opposed to the higher constitutional standard, you get a warrant,  probable cause of crime, in order to get the camel's nose under the tent.   In order to start listening to what someone is saying because they don't  have probable cause of crime but they do have probable cause of talking to  a foreign person.  Carter Page hasn't been charged with anything.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They served failed every conceivable thing about him for a  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was such -- he was such an enemy of the state, you would  have seen charges by now.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why the story outrages me.  And you know, the fact, what  John Ratcliffe told us is that when you have two pieces of information, you  have one thing from the unverified dossier to present to the FISA court,  then you have another piece of information that completely refutes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It refutes anything that Trump had anything to do with Russia  collusion, but they didn't present that to the FISA court.  They held that  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think -- I think you and I talked, maybe it was last week  about an experience I had on the bench where I learned that when  investigators came to me for an emergency search warrant which I signed.   They did not tell me what they also knew about it.  Years later, trying the  case, I said how did you get this -- how did you get this search warrant?   Did you tell the judge about this?  Not realizing that it was me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And I threw the charges out.  </p><p>So, the consequences of misbehavior by agents of the executive branch,  whether at the state level where I was or the federal level which is what  we're talking about, by not telling everything to the court can be  catastrophic for whatever they are trying to accomplish.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's Maria's issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are on the story like no one else, not just in T.V. but in  the media in general.  Because it falls by the wayside as people move on to  like out -- the outrage at the moment.  This is outrageous.  Because there  aren't any consequences.  Will anybody ever pay for doing this?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- who knows?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's put this in context of where we are, ia presidential  election year, the year is 2016.  You had one team wanting to spy on the  other team.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You had Hillary's team and the Obama administration saying you  know what, let's spy on Trump.  Let's do this.  And then, they get the  warrant to do so.  It's wrong.  It's disgusting.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two aspects here that we haven't talked about and that  is when the president of the United States said I'm going to release all  this FISA stuff, I haven't seen it but my people -- but my people have seen  it.  Who went to him and begged him not to?  British intelligence and  Israeli intelligence, which tells you their fingerprints are on it.  Which  tells you that through Jack Brennan the Obama administration was more  likely than not using foreign intelligence to commence its surveillance of  then candidate Trump and the people are watching them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they were just trying to do whatever they could to spy on  the political enemy.  It's as simple as that.  They wanted to spy on their  political enemy.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yet again, but it was also Susan  Rice didn't have -- she used surveillance, right?  She put in for the  application.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then unmasked everybody.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one -- I don't know this to be so.</p><p>KELLY:  This is getting back (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one that got this information to the  Washington Post.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And then they leaked it.  The strategy was  incredible.  </p><p>First, come up with this narrative, that Trump had anything to do with  Russia meddling.  Then, leak it to the media, let it -- get it into the  site guys.  Then, get informants to lure Trump people and say, Donald  Junior, let's go do a meeting, I've got this informant.  They're all  informants.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are some very angry Republicans about what Congressman  Goodlatte told you yesterday and who are they?  Republicans on the  committee that are not permitted to participate in this interrogation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan say Rosenstein's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- writing the rules for his own testimony because it was Rod  Rosenstein who said, you know what, we want two Republicans and two  Democrats in the room.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, when that happens and when it is recorded -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  on Wednesday.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  And then goes to the Intelligence Committee to  whitewash any classified material.  Then Republicans will leak their  version and Democrats will leak their version.  Yet again, instead of  letting the American people see that what the people we sent to Washington  to work for us are doing -- excuse me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  With the power we gave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that, declassify.  And President needs --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They talked the -- they talked the president out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  The president needs to declassify these  documents so the American people can understand what went on here.  Is this  going to have a factor in the midterm?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  When and when and if it comes out, I think  it will be too late.  I don't -- I don't think this can -- this can come  out in the next two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham also had a lot to say about this and he's going  to be doing a 13 city tour.  He's now, you know, looked at by the  Republican as the guy to sell their colleagues.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he became very popular when in the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  After Kavanaugh.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- in the midst of the Kavanaugh hearings, enough was enough,  I'm tired of this prosecutor from Arizona asking the questions, I'm tired  of what the Democrats are doing.  I'm going to take charge here and he did.   He lost his temper, or at least, it appeared that he did.  But he  galvanized a lot of the Republican base as well as all the Republicans on  the committee.  And pretty much chasing the Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because people felt like he was -- he was speaking for them.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody who was on the right felt the same way that Lindsey  Graham did.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think they're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Watching these hearings.  So, whether -- and he just spoke from  his heart.  I mean, being a very blunt, passionate southerner.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I recognize that kind of behavior.  He's like enough is enough.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Are you a one passionate southerner?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm probably more prone to expletives than the senator.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  McKenzie, do we have the sound bite of Lindsey Graham?  I want  to tell you what Lindsey Graham said about the midterm elections and  specifically this investigation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The FBI investigation.  He's expecting to be the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham is.  Here's Lindsey Graham  with me yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, the House promises to  impeach the president and Kavanaugh.  I think the Republicans will continue  to try to hold the FBI and Department of Justice accountable for abuse of  power.  </p><p>If I'm the chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year, we hold the  Senate.  I promise you we're going to find out about the Simpson -- Fusion  GPS problem.  I promise you, we're going to get to the bottom of how they  used a dossier, prepared by foreign agents, paid for by the Democratic  Party to get a warrant against an American citizen.  We're not going to  turn our back on this.</p><p>If I'm chairman, we're going to get to the bottom of this.  And the only  way for me to be chairman is for us to hold the Senate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if the Republicans hold the senate, as seems likely, if  the Democrats take the House which this morning seems likely, the two  chairs of the Judiciary Committee couldn't be more opposite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerry Nadler.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And all the stuff that Congressman Goodlatte wants to come  out, the Democrats take the House, we'll never see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It goes away.  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Another consequence of this midterm election.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, great to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know I was kidding, McD.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know you were -- of course you were -- not really, actually.   Expletive, expletive, expletive.  You're lucky I didn't say -- you know  what, if I was really mad, I'd say --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I want to hear you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  coming up, major changes at CBS to tell you about, the details  as interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning from the company's board,  that's next.</p><p>And then a brawl on the basketball court, why three players and the lead  singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were ejected.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Get this, a college party turned into a  nightmare.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl, what a story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  These poor kids, Maria.  About  30 people sent to the hospital after a floor suddenly gave way beneath them  during a party near the campus of Clemson University.  This happened in  South Carolina.  The whole thing captured on a party-goers iPhone.  </p><p>Yes, well, a witness says people were jumping to a popular song when the  floor just caved in.  Clemson said the police said none of the injuries are  luckily, life-threatening.  </p><p>Well, the interim chairman of CBS resigned after a month on the job due to  health issues.  Richard Parsons is stepping down after his doctors told him  to reduce his workload so he can deal with complications from multiple  myeloma.  Strauss Zelnick, another new board member is going to take over  for Parsons.  Shares of CBS are down three percent so far this year.  </p><p>Then there is this, guys, Senator Elizabeth Warren defending her decision  to take a DNA test to prove she is indeed part Native American.  So, at a  debate yesterday for her Senate seat, Warren said that she did it to,  quote:  Rebuild trust in the government through transparency.  </p><p>In March, Warren had said that no DNA test was needed to prove her claim  but she said she ultimately took the test which showed a relative six to 10  generations ago was indeed Native American.  And we played the ad for our  viewers last week, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what was -- what was that, one, 1000.  </p><p>CASONE:  Six to 10 generations.  Six grandparents ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the -- at the -- at the least, she is one, 1,024th native  American, which would put here at a lower percentage than the average  European-American in terms of the percentage of their background that is  Native American.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we still talking about this?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because she can't shut up about it.</p><p>KELLY:  Because Democrats --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She thinks the more she talks about it, she's somehow going to  be right.  Number one, she caved in to President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number one.  Number two, Harvard law school was presenting her  as their first woman of color.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In print.  Harvard law spokesman -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, she did gain them -- she gained from lying.  </p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  This is --  this is why it mattered.  As she was technically their minority person on  their faculty.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And so she deliberately traded on this part of status of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You know, which is not knowing that it was in any way true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Are you a Taco Bell fan?  We will tell you how you  can score a free taco during the World Series, next.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are seven weeks into the NFL season.  The standings are  beginning to take shape.  Jared Max said the Chiefs are on top in the AFC.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria, the AFC really  looks like a two-team race between the Chiefs and the Patriots.  </p><p>One week after New England handed Kansas City its first loss, on the last  second field goal, Kansas City barbecued the Bengals, 45-10.   PatrickMahomes, four more touchdown passes, the Chiefs goes to 6-1, 45-10.  </p><p>Because of a snap penalty against Dallas, the Cowboy's 47-yard potential  game tying field goal became a 52-yarder.  Would have been good for 47, but  the Redskins win.  First place Redskins beat the Cowboys 20-17.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Losers, the Cowboys.  Losers.  Continue, Jared.  </p><p>MAX:  The Carolina Panthers -- the Carolina Panthers came back from 17 down  to beat the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles by three.  Panthers' Eric  Reid earlier had to be restrained before the opening coin toss.  Reid went  after the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and other players.  </p><p>Now, last year Jenkins co-founded the NFL players coalition to work with  the league on social justice issues.  Now, Jenkins no longer kneels for the  anthem.  Reid does.  And he thinks Jenkins is a sellout.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC REID, SAFETY, PANTHERS:  I believe Malcolm capitalized on the  situation.  He co-opted the movement that was started by Collin to get his  organization funding.  It's cowardly.  He sold us out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Sold them out, wow.  </p><p>And football, we have feistiness and also in the NBA.  After Saturday's  Lakers, Rockets game, became fight night at L.A. at the NBA, suspends three  players total of nine games without pay.  Chris Paul of the Rockets, two  games suspended.  He poked Rajon Rondo in the eye.  Rondo started to punch  Paul.  He got three games, one more than Paul, because he threw the first  punch and appears to have spit right at Chris Paul.  Now, this instigated  the fight.  Rondo throws a several punches and the Lakers Brandon Ingram  gets four games.  Wow.  </p><p>World Series begins tomorrow night on Fox at Fenway Park.  The Red Sox  favored to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Chris Sale will be Boston's game  one starter, likely Clayton Kershaw for L.A.  </p><p>World Series provisionally Taco Bell will give out free Doritos tacos --  free Doritos Locos Tacos, got to go crazy, for four hours on November 1st,  all we have to see is a base get stolen in the World Series and the free  Doritos Locos Tacos is yours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, bring on the Locos Tacos.  </p><p>MAX:  Two quiero, Taco Bell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p>CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.   Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government  revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.  </p><p>Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi  Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action  against the kingdom.  This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad  bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their  condolences.  </p><p>Plus, caravan crisis.  The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United  States border is growing.  It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on  that caravan.</p><p>On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol  Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House  investigators.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p>We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p>So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p>KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p>HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p>He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p>The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p>And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p>And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p>And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p>And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p>We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p>YORK:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p>The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p>ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p>YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p>We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p>Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p>HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p>YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p>The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p>And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p>However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p>So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p>We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p>The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p>Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p>And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p>OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p>Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p>European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p>The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p>All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p>FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p>FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p>FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p>FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p>FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p>FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p>FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p>FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p>FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p>FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p>FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p>News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.   Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.  I have alerted  Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency.  Must change  laws!\"  That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed  to the border of the U.S.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, we're watching oil.  Brent  rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00  and change, what's driving this market.  Then, 15 days until midterm  elections.  The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart  Varney on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The economy under President Trump, the  President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections  according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p>I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p>I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p>Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p>SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning  to you.  Thank you so much.  Happy Monday.  We'll see you in a little bit,  girls.  Thank you.  It is Monday, October 27th -- October 22nd.  Good  morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Markets this morning are higher.  Here are your top stories.  6:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Fighting for gains, futures indicating the markets this morning will open  fractionally better on the session.  Dow Industrials up 25, NASDAQ up 31  right now, half a percent higher.</p><p> This after a mixed story on Wall Street on Friday.  The market snapped a  two-day losing streak, posting a slight gain on the session with the Dow  Industrials up 65 points, quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  weaker on Friday at the close.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are edging higher, take a look.  FT-100 up  a half percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of a percent, 40 points higher. </p><p> In Asia overnight, gains across the board at the close.  And as you see,  the Shanghai Composite, the best performer out of China, up better than  four percent on the session.</p><p> Stocks in china soaring.  The government revealing tax changes to help  support the slowing economy.  And with that, a multi-move across the board,  and the averages, best in four years.</p><p> Investors bracing for the busiest week of earnings season so far.  Ten Dow  Components due to report their third quarter earnings, plus technology  giants Amazon and Alphabet on deck this week.</p><p> On Friday, we get the first look at third quarter GDP.  That could be a  market mover.  We'll break it all down and we got all the preview on  earnings as well.</p><p> Another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says that  he wants to get something done before November eight days from now, what  that means ahead of the midterm elections this morning.</p><p> And upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is headed to  Saudi Arabia today, amid pressure to take action against the Kingdom after  it admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p> Senator Lindsey Graham telling me on Sunday Morning Futures he felt used by  the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he's open to keeping the arms  seal -- sales deal on track.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it impossible to believe  that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So, go after him and his inner  circle, save they alliance.</p><p> I don't mind military sales, but I cannot do business with the current  leadership.  MBS, he's done to me.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p> Plus, caravan crisis, thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into Mexico  with their sights on the U.S.A.  We're going to take you live to the border  to get an update on that caravan this morning.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  </p><p> And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and Independent Women's Voice CEO,  Heather Higgins, is here this morning.  Good to see you.</p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Thank you </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS:  It's going to be a  hectic week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hectic week because of earnings, hectic week because of?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  GDP out on Friday.  We find out how fast this country was  growing in the third quarter and if we need more tax cuts, quite frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  President said that on the campaigns trial on  Saturday, but it's also a huge week for earnings.  We've got technology in  the spotlight, Amazon and Alphabet may very well move markets.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, big time.  Especially because I'm looking forward to Verizon  tomorrow because they're going to talk about their 5G rollout.  They did it  in four different cities.  So, that's the way with the future.  </p><p> We'll see how much capital they need to put into that.  That's part of the  Infrastructure Bill.  Remember the President keeps talking about  infrastructure?  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, 5G is part of that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The GDP number on Friday, Dagen, I guess the, you know, Atlanta  Fed was all the way up at, what, four -- better than 4.5 percent, 4.8  percent or so?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  But the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where are we now on that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, the Wall Street Journal, in its estimate, so it was 4.2  percent in the second quarter, but the third quarter is expected to come in  at 3.4 percent in the preliminary reading.  A wide -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still a good number.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A widening trade gap could be a drag on third quarter GDP.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ooh.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Based on the Journal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  So good backdrop, Heather.</p><p> HIGGINS:  It is now.  And they're -- the administration's really happy with  anything over three percent just because we --- they keep saying --  everybody said even three percent was impossible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  We're so happy to have anything over three percent.  That is  great.  And so -- but they're looking at these four percent plus numbers  and they're thrilled.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you get the biggest week of third quarter earnings so far.   That's going to also show you some real growth.  That means like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent company, Alphabet, all setting to report along  with 10 Dow Components.</p><p> On the economic side, the highlight of the week, of course, is that GDP  report.  And in terms of what we're going to see in terms of market  expectations.  Pretty much baked in a better than three percent number?  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think it is.  One of the things that has weighed on  economists has been the tariffs, and so that's why the look-through into  tech earnings this week is, what have the implications been.  </p><p> Especially when you think about Apple, they come out next week.  They  haven't updated the guidance, but they said the tariffs are a tax on  consumers.  So, how is that going to impact their phone sales, especially  because they came out with new releases?  </p><p> I think it's interesting to note that technology stocks are only valued  seven percent higher than the general market.  The market's trading about  15.9 times earnings, tech's around 16.6, but they have twice the profit  margins.</p><p> So, let's see what the guidance is coming forward.  So you saw Goldman  Sachs even came out earlier this week.  I mean, last week.</p><p> They were talking about how tech isn't overvalued and that this the selloff  has been unwarranted, but it's important to note that investors have been  rotating into safer names.</p><p> They don't think we're going to get 10, 20, 30 percent returns going  forward.  They went into consumer staples stocks.  Consumer staples stocks  are up 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  Technology stocks are down 3.5 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing to also watch out for, the Wall Street Journal writes  about this in today's paper.  Slowing sales growth.</p><p> So instead of earnings, because, again, if sales growth slows -- and we  have had, according to the Journal, 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies  have reported so far.  Based on our estimates, it's actually 38 percent,  miss-sales forecasts.</p><p> If sustained, that quarterly sales miss-ratio would mark the highest so far  this year.  So again, if you're coming up short on sales for whatever  reason, whether it's higher prices that you -- you're not -- that you're  trying to pass on and people aren't buying it, whatever the reason, that  doesn't bode well for earnings growth into next year.  </p><p> And sales are only growing, are expected to grow 7.3 percent, which is  slightly lower than expectations going into this quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the guidance is going to be reflecting what the  expectations are on the trade situation, right?  On tariffs.</p><p> Because if we start -- this is when we're going to know.  I mean, companies  should probably guide us toward us, \"All right, we're going to see lower  sales than expected because of the tariffs.\"</p><p> I don't know that's the case, but I would imagine this is the quarter when  we find out if, in fact, it is going to weigh on earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the most important thing that the market's going to  focus is operating margins.  They think margins are going to come down and  be compressed because several factors.  Some of them are the rising input  costs, now we're seeing inflation's going up.  </p><p> We're also seeing labor costs are going up, costs of goods are going up.</p><p> HIGGINS:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  So the problem is this, how are they going to be able to maintain  that, if they're not able to get more productivity out of their workers?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  If you can pass on these higher costs, which like with  Unilever, some of the big consumer products companies, then that's good  news. The -- </p><p> I mean not ultimately to the customer, but it's good news for the companies  again, but it's -- again, the higher input costs, you can't -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  It's -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  For whatever reason, it's not just tariffs.  Watch a lot of  companies potentially, if they're coming up short, start to blame tariffs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're going to have to kind of comb through the -- try and  separate the fact from the fiction.</p><p> HIGGINS:  It'll be -- </p><p> KELLY:  Also the storm, they'll see that in -- about the storms, right?  So  we -- they'll think next quarter's going to be weak because of the storms,  whatever's happening.</p><p> We've seen -- Home Depot should be strong, but they actually got a  downgrade last week because they think the consumer's not going to be as  strong in upgrading their homes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, whatever weakness we see, the President's trying to  offset it now with talk of more tax cuts ahead of the election. </p><p> He spoke to reporters just this weekend about a package that they're  working on right now.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be sometime, just prior I would say to November.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, Election Day is 15 days away at this point, November  1st.  Ten days away.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He didn't say which November.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, of course, you know, Congress is out of session until  after the November Elections.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So maybe he comes out with an announcement before midterm  elections, but we're not going to see a vote, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  And quite frankly, the deficit is becoming -- it's starting  to become an issue for politicians and for the American people.</p><p> President Trump said \"I'm ordering all my cabinet secretaries to cut their  spending by 5 percent.  But discretionary spending is what one-third --  roughly one-third of the entire budget every year.  And if you cut out  defense, it's a cut -- I think it represents less than one percent of  overall spending.</p><p> So again, I don't -- he -- it would take -- it's a long road to plow in  terms of pushing through a tax cut at this point.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But we know they want to make the individual cut permanent and  we know that that's going to be on their agenda should they have the  opportunity, even after the midterm elections.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe it --I mean he said Kevin Brady is working on it.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  House, Ways and Means.  So maybe it's an announcement from  House, Ways and Means before the midterms.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  It could be.  They won't get anything passed.  But it's been  pretty clear that even though they passed the first tax cut, that even  though they were constrained by certain prior agreements to have the  individual cuts be temporary, the goal was always to make those be  permanent.</p><p> You are now seeing a recovery which, for the first time in a very long  time, is being led by blue-collar job growth, blue-collar wages, small  business confidence, rather than leading from the top.</p><p> It's sort of from the bottom.  And those people are going to be going into  the midterms looking at this fantastically booming economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Trump's approval ratings are now higher than Obama's were going  into his first midterms.  And his disapproval ratings have actually come  down, layering on a promised middle-class tax cuts can't hurt.</p><p> And -- because serious way, if you want to take on the deficit, and this  may be the one President who can cut through the swamp and actually get  this done, because the creatures on both sides of the aisle like the  current services baseline, economic gains that would never, ever be allowed  in the private sector in terms of automatic budget increases and claiming.  </p><p> Because, you know, they get to claim to these two different constituents  coming into their office and for the exact same thing, they get to claim  that they were either cutting it or increasing it because of the semantics  involved with the built-in increases.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  If you're serious about taking on the deficit, then have you to  be serious on taking on the financial accounting games that are played in  Washington.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there's Saudi Arabia on deck as well.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin now defending his decision to go to Saudi.  He's meeting  with Saudi officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p> He says the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at this critical moment.   He's not going to that conference, but this trip comes after Saudi Arabia  said that Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was in fact killed  in a fist fight inside the Istanbul Consulate.</p><p> The Kingdom is forcefully denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  Lawmakers, though, are showing  skepticism on that.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Did the Crown Prince know anything  about it?  If there were people closely tied to him involved in this  operation?</p><p> ADEL BIN AHMED AL-JUBEIR, DIPLOMAT, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:   There weren't people closely tied to him who were involved in this  operation.  This was an operation that was a rogue operation. </p><p> This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities  and responsibilities they had.</p><p> GRAHAM:  it's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to  kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it.  That would  be brazen abuse of authority.</p><p> He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in  Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I will quote the Wall Street Journal editorial today on this  very issue.  Saudi Arabia needs to step up.  We still don't know -- they  haven't produced Khashoggi's body, provided more details of precisely how  or when he decide.</p><p> The story doesn't add up.  Of the 18 people arrested, five others sacked,  several a part of Mohammed bin Salman the inner circle.  It's unlikely they  would have acted alone without at least, you know, feeling a tacit assent  from the Crown Prince.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal editorial goes on to write, \"The U.S. goal should  be to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear that  murdering journalists is unacceptable and that Mohammed bin Salman's  erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral  relationship.\"</p><p> We can't dictate what King Salman will do about who should run Saudi  Arabia, but you can -- but Mohammed bin Salman also can't be allowed to  conclude that America thinks this is no big deal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they've got to do something.  The U.S. has to do  something to push back in the face of this heinous situation.</p><p> Question is, does Mohammed bin Salman survive?  He's got two other sons.   There are a lot of people who want this guy out at this point.  Lindsey  Graham included.</p><p> So big question here, you know, I mean, the arms sales is going -- it's  going to go through.  The relationship is going to go through because  there's one big black eye here that we're faced with and that is Iran, so.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the muddled response from this administration and the uneven  response that we've seen since this all began, we need to be on very firm  footing about the message, like Lindsey Graham said that we send to King  Salman about who we -- who should run the country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  I want to disagree.  I think that the administration has been  taking a difficult situation.  These are people that behaved really badly,  like so many of the people we've had to deal with.  And they've got this  challenge of how do you negotiate making them pay for it, making them fess  up to it, but not having them lose so much for -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But comparing it to Brett Kavanaugh was a misstep.  I'm sorry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  </p><p> When we come back, it's shifting gears for FiatChrysler.  Details on the  automaker's roughly $7 billion car parts deal.  That's next.  </p><p> And then a spooky box office debut, we've got it here on Halloween.  Stay  with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Battle at the border for sure, a migrant caravan  moving toward the United States.  It has grown now to roughly 5,000 people.   Griff Jenkins is live in McAllen, Texas this morning with details there,  right in the middle of it.  Griff.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  When the  caravan gets to this border, if they do indeed come here, they're going to  find an overwhelmed border already with illegal crossing.  </p><p> And the Rio Grande Valley Sector where I'm standing McAllen is the busiest  sector of the entire U.S. border, and it had more than 12,700 illegal  crossing arrests in just the last three weeks.  </p><p> Over the weekend, over 800 pounds of marijuana confiscated, and it is part  of the problem here they're seeing is also family units, women and children  coming, much like the caravan of migrants from Central American countries.</p><p> We spent time yesterday with the Sector Chief, a guy named Manuel Padilla,  talking about the caravan that's coming and what he says is a need for more  infrastructure.  Take a listen.</p><p> MANUEL PADILLA, CHIEF, RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR:  If we had this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure throughout my border,  we would truly transform this area.  It's a win-win situation for  everybody.</p><p> This area right here, we do not see MS-13, we do not see criminal aliens  coming into this area, because of the capability that we have through this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure.</p><p> JENKINS:  But he's only got well and about 55 of the nearly 300 parts of  this sector and it's a busy one.  The President, Maria, will be in Houston  today and Houston is in this RGV area.  I'm sure this topic will certainly  come up.  Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins is live  McAllen, Texas.  </p><p> What a scene.  We are going to be watching that as that caravan moves  closer to where Griff is actually standing.</p><p> Switching gears, a deadly train derailment in Taiwan.  Cheryl Casone with  that right now in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, good morning.</p><p> An express train went off the tracks, killing at least 18 people.  This  happened in Eastern Taiwan.  More than 150 others were injured in this  disaster.  Witnesses say all eight of the train's carriages went off the  rails as it was traveling to the eastern city of Taitung.</p><p> This comes a year after another express train on the same line derailed.   The cause of yesterday's accident, under investigation.</p><p> Well, Fiat Chrysler is unloading its car parts business.  The company is  selling the unit to Japan's Calsonic Kansei for just over $7 billion.   Calsonic is owned by the U.S. private-equity firm, KKR.  The deal is going  to make the newly-combined company one of the world's biggest auto parts  suppliers.</p><p> The FiatChrysler- - excuse me -- in the premarket up 4.6 percent, about.</p><p> And then finally, there is this.  The horror movie, \"Halloween,\" making a  killing at the box office this weekend.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this  night.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been preparing for this for a long time. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is not safe to be on the streets tonight.  Go  home!  Get out of here!  Get inside!  Michael?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The film raking in $77.5 million, a record opening for the  franchise.  It also is the second-best October opening weekend of all time. </p><p> Holding on to second place, in its third weekend, \"A Star Is Born,\" $19.3  million.  </p><p> Rounding out top five, last week's big winner was \"Venom,\" followed by \"  Goosebumps 2:  Haunted Halloween,\" and, Maria, \"First Man.\"  </p><p> Jamie Curtis, she's still got it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, she does.  Good movies this weekend.  Thanks, Cheryl. </p><p> Coming up, a new way to calculate your FICO score, we will tell you why  your cash may help.  That's next.</p><p> And then Facebook goes shopping.  The technology giant's reported plan to  purchase a cybersecurity company, all right here after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Increasing access to credit, Fair Isaac, the  company behind the FICO score, is rolling out a major change, UltraFICO  Score will go beyond payment history.</p><p> According to the Journal this morning, it will factor in bank account  activity, how consumers manage their cash and checking, savings and money  market accounts.  It launches next year. </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Mark Hamrick.  He's  Bankrate.com's Senior Economic Analyst.  </p><p> And Mark, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining  us.  </p><p> MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you think this is about younger people, this new FICO  change.  Tell us about it.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Primarily, and we think about the fact that there's a large  portion of the U.S. population which really isn't doing business with  traditional financial service companies.  Millennial have been smart.   They're saving more money.</p><p> Our recent Bankrate survey found that about two-thirds of the American  public was essentially limiting its spending and millennials are doing the  best job of saving more money so that money is sitting in accounts not  necessarily being spent.</p><p> At Bankrate, we say that the two biggest problems that have been identified  by Americans is their failure to save for retirement and for emergencies.   So, financial companies want to create new customers and help connect them  to borrowing products.  It's a logical step for them.</p><p> KELLY:  Is there a way to opt out of this?  It's -- the last thing I want  with the Equifax hacking and everything going on about security, the last  thing I want is somebody to pull up my UltraFICO to see how much money --  cash I have in a bank account, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how you're managing all your money, and all your accounts.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Savings, checking.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Yes.  Well, to the question, I think you're right on.  I think  Americans are tired of having their personal information essentially taken  from them.  </p><p> And I think this is going to be something to watch in terms of regulation  in the coming years, whether it's the information that Facebook and Google  possess about us or our credit rating scores, because I think we have a  sense that we have no control over this information.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the -- with the -- this new FICO score, is this a way  to essentially offer people even more credit, if you will, that this is at  a time when people are increasingly stretched, that you've seen auto  lending particularly on the fringes of people with very low subprime auto  lending really being pulled back on?  </p><p> Is this a way to basically shine up people's credit scores and make them  more palatable to the lender?  </p><p> HAMRICK:  That's a very good question.  I think that is essentially the  tension that could be created by this.  In other words, giving loans to  people who are not well qualified. </p><p> But that, I don't think, is the intention.  Most financial service firms  are not looking to create new losses.</p><p> Fed Chair Powell has said that he thinks that household balance sheets are  in good shape.  He's more concerned about the commercial side.</p><p> So, I think this is more about trying to identify good data about consumers  and potential borrowers and connecting them to products that they might  find useful.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Meanwhile, you've got a new survey on how Americans are spending,  and if they're cutting back on spending, right?  Let's talk about that.  </p><p> Sixty-six percent say that they're living -- they're limiting spending,  thirty-six percent say that they are doing it to save money.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Yes, and I think this is a good thing.  As I said, you know, I  don't think there are many Americans that go essentially into their last  days saying, \"You know what, I saved too much money.\"  Ii think more  Americans regret that they didn't do a better job of saving for retirement  or emergencies.</p><p> HIGGINS:  And I think that 36 percent was only of the 66 percent that were  saving.  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Right.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  So it was only 24 percent overall that we're saving for longer  term.</p><p> The other thing that was interesting in the study was, there has long been  a contention that the big difference between how well you do in life is how  long your time horizon is.</p><p> And when you looked at the study, the people who were making over $50,000  clearly had a longer time horizon that they were saving for, whereas the  people who were under that were just sort of saving for the short-term  needs and they weren't thinking beyond that.</p><p> How, if we're going to move away from the Keynesian mentality, that the  more debt you have and the more spending you have, the better off we all  are, to one where people are more prudent and thinking about their savings,  how is borrowing going to help that happen?</p><p> HAMRICK:  I think essentially, it's two different questions.  I think the  first question is, as long as you have a healthy economy, most Americans  will be mindful of trying to achieve proper financial goals.</p><p> I do think in our society, we have a significant problem with lack of  financial literacy and that's an education issue, which i don't hear a lot  of people talking about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's too bad.  It really just starts at home.  But we're  certainly interested in that.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mark, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you this morning.  Mark Hamrick joining us from  Bankrate.com.  </p><p> Take a short break.  When we come back, Jamie Dimon's big bet, why J.P.  Morgan is building a campus in Silicon Valley.  That's coming up.</p><p> Then fixing traffic gridlock, details on Elon Musk's high-speed transit  tunnel.  It's nearly finished.  Will it offer free rides to the public?  We  will tell you about that.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, October  22nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  The major  indices on Wall Street looking to open higher this morning ahead of a big  week for earnings.  This right here is the high of the morning, up 73  points on the Dow Industrials, a quarter of a percent.  The NASDAQ is up  two-thirds of a percent, that's 42 points higher.  This after a mixed close  on Friday, all ahead of a big week in earnings.  This is one of the busiest  weeks we're going to see.  </p><p>Dow Industrials, on Friday, up 65 points at the close, a quarter of a  percent higher.  The S&amp;P500 was flat, down one point; and the NASDAQ was  lower by half a percent, 36 points lower on NASDAQ on Friday.  In Europe  this morning, take a look at indices, higher across the board.  FT-100 up  two-thirds of one percent; CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent;  and the DAX Index in Germany, up two-thirds of one percent right now.   Asian markets closed higher overnight.  The Shanghai Composite was up  strong, up four percent.  China's government revealing tax cuts over the  weekend to help boost that economy which has shown slowdown.  </p><p>Facebook is eyeing, shoring up its security.  The company reportedly  looking to make an acquisition in cyber sector.  Plus, the company faces  request a from Japan to beef up security.  Building the future.  Details on  JPMorgan Chase's newest investment in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you  what's behind that move.  And then a rare -- a rare reality.  Elon Musk  tweeting out date for his hyperloop transport.  When you can expect to take  a ride on a high-speed rail, from Elon Musk?  And forget getting candies in  your trick or treat bags.  We've got the very list of the U.S. cities  spending the most on Halloween this year -- it might surprise you.  </p><p> First though, our top story this half an hour.  Countdown to midterm  elections now 15 days away.  President Trump and former President Obama  squaring off in dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  President Trump will hit the campaign trail  in Houston in support of Ted Cruz, while former President Obama will  touchdown in Las Vegas and campaign there.  Enthusiasm for President Trump  is high, lines of supporters are already covering entire blocks as nearly  100,000 people wait to enter venue that can hold 18,000.  18,000 is what  the capacity is.  </p><p> Yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham to get his take on the most important issues on the ballot  this November.  President Trump has hand-picked Senator Graham to go out  and campaign for colleagues.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRAHAM:  I think people are going to be voting on the mob rule of the  Democratic Party.  If you like Democrats around the House, you know exactly  what you're going to get: They're going to try and impeach the president,  impeach Kavanaugh; they don't care about your wallet, they just want to get  in your wallet.  </p><p> If you keep Republicans in charge, we're going to keep the economy moving  forward, we're going to secure our border, we're going to deal with our  enemies throughout the world, we're going to rebuild our military.  And  when it comes to standing up to the world, you need a strong leader like  President Trump, and the Democratic Party has showed us what they would do  with power, not much for you.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the president has asked Lindsey Graham to go on the road;  he's going to talk -- he's going to be in 13 cities in just a couple of  days.  Joining us right now is Republican Strategist Kimberly Klacik.   Kimberly, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.   Your reaction to Senator Graham and what you might expect from him in the  next couple of days as he travels to 13 cities to campaign?  </p><p> KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I see this new Lindsey Graham that  we've been seeing, I expect good things.  I mean, he's absolutely right.   You know exactly what you're going to get if the Democrats take over the  House.  They have been intolerant lately.  The mob -- the mob name actually  fits them properly.  And I think for a lot of people, we don't really  understand whether or not there is a blue wave coming.  I'm not convinced.   In 2016, everyone said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, we saw that  Trump won and that's basically because people were afraid to show support  for Trump, so I don't think we really know what's going to happen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The president's new line lately in his campaigns have been  \"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.\"  We saw that mob- thinking again this weekend when Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao  were harassed while they were at dinner, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, and there was a panel in MSNBC that essentially justifies  this kind of behavior base on the fact that Merrick Garland didn't get a  vote in front of the Senate under Mitch McConnell.  That was -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, it's justified.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, that that's justified.  And they're -- the message from  the Democrats is \"we are coming for you.\"  If you support Trump, we're  going to show up at your place of work, where you eat, where you live.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how do you deny that's not the mob?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It is the mob.  I think that that's a great slogan.  He's --  President Trump is also really focused on immigration, attention to the  border wall, and in fact, I know that Joe Donnelly who is a Democrat  running for election in Indiana has actually running ads promoting his  support of President Trump on immigration -- border wall.  And radical left  talking about abolishing ICE.  So, smart Democrats like Donnelly in  Indiana, they know that this is an important issue to Americans.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because -- and then you've got Kevin McCathy bringing the  bill to the floor right after midterms, Kimberly, to build the wall,  enforce the law -- act, that's what it is.  And voter interest in this  election has surged today record highs in both parties.  A new Wall Street  Journal/NBC News poll finds that nearly two-thirds of registered voters say  they are very interested in this year's midterms, that's the highest ever  recorded by the survey.  President Trump's job approval rating, as we just  heard, got a boost, the poll finds that approval rating now at 47 percent.   This is the highest of his time in office, Kimberly, going into these  midterm elections, what are your thoughts?  </p><p> KLACIK:  Yes, and it's well deserved.  You see, President Trump -- I don't  think the Democrats have identified that he's done anything wrong.  You  have to remember, usually, Democrats run on making promises, usually  promises they can't keep.  And so, right now, you have a bunch of problems  that Trump is solving on his own.  People were talking about immigration  and they should, because this is really a threat on our national security.   It's not about not wanting people to come in and live for the American  dream.  So, yes, they are absolutely right about this, and I think that is  why there's overwhelming support right now for President Trump, because  there's a lot of people on his side here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you know, Heather, when you look at these pictures of  this caravan making its way to the United States, it is just perfect timing  going into the midterm elections because it's a reminder that the president  is trying to secure the borders and have legal immigration.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  The caravan is the single largest one picture argument for a wall  that Trump could have ever asked for.  And particularly, when you see the  soldiers in Guatemala or the police there trying to stop it and getting  overrun on the fences, getting overrun --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HIGGINS:  What's interesting about the poll that just came out, I've been  saying from the beginning that there was not going to be a blue wave and  that the Republicans, actually, I will predict will keep the House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  And the poll has been interesting in that is now down to a nine- point Democrat advantage in the generic, but if you look in the  battleground states, it is completely even now.  I think, I think it is not  going to be the blue wave, I think it's going to be a major red wall, and  there's going to be more pick-ups in the Senate as well as holding of the  House.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know I'm talking out both sides in my mouth, one problem,  though, in President Trump making immigration a front and center issue,  talking about the wall is the fact that the Republicans in control of the  Senate and the House didn't fully fund his wall, and they didn't basically  starve the sanctuary cities of money.  This is another can that's been  kicked down the road after midterms, so in some way, he's highlighting what  the Republicans haven't gotten done, but they haven't fulfilled agenda on  this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely right.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Exactly.  This has been the biggest problem that Republicans have  had to overcome is their failure to follow through on things that they  promised to do, whether it was health care or taking on sanctuary cities or  border wall funding, I think part of the reason that you saw the tremendous  lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters until the Kavanaugh hearings was  that there was this disjunction, what had been promised versus what had  been delivered in the general sense of why would I bother voting for you?   Kavanaugh made it very clear why you would bother voting for them because  the alternative was much worse.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, now, Donald Trump just gave them another reason and that's  tax cut 2.0.  So, if you think about it, no better way to mobilize people  to vote than tell them you're going to do tax cut 2.0 a couple of weeks  before election.  So, I think that timing was perfect and he's now throwing  the Democrats in a (INAUDIBLE), because he's going to make them start  talking about taxes and has done very well for Republicans.  </p><p> BARTIROMO: And let not forget -- let's not forget, Kimberly, not one  Democrat voted for that tax cut plan.  </p><p> KLACIK:  Yes, that's true.  So, how much are they really for the American  people?  I think that right now this is the perfect storm, like you said  the caravan coming is the perfect storm.  We have to remember, do we really  want people in our country, as the first thing they do when they get here  is break our laws?  We are a nation of laws and we deserve to know who our  neighbors are, and we should be vetting legal immigrants.  I think,  honestly, I don't see the blue wave either.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kimberly, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p> KLACIK:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kimberly Klacik joining us there.  Coming up, doubling down on  data protection, details on Facebook's reported plans to purchase a  cybersecurity company, that's next.  And then getting into the Halloween  spirit, we will tell you the city spending the most money on Halloween  ahead of October 31.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New pressure this morning on Facebook over data  protection, Cheryl Casone on it in headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, the Japanese government has ordered Facebook to better  protect user data.  Japan's asking the company to fully communicate  security issues to its users and inform regulators of any change in  security measures.  This, of course, comes after Facebook said earlier this  month, hackers stole information of about 30 million people.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly planning to go buy a major cybersecurity  firm.  Reports say Facebook has approached several companies for a  potential acquisition.  Taking a look at shares of the company down 13  percent so far this year, there's Facebook.  </p><p> Well, JPMorgan Chase is planning to build a new campus that's going to  focus on Fintech or Financial Technology.  This campus is going to be out  in Silicon Valley.  More than 1,000 employees are going to work at the  campus when it opens up in Palo Alto in 2020.  A project part of an effort  by JPMorgan to keep up with changes in digital payments which is big  business.  Most of the employers are going to work for JPMorgan Chase's  merchant services division.  Shares of JPMorgan are up nearly one percent  so far this year.  </p><p> And Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry in the United States.   So, this year, Americans are expected to spend $9 billion on candy,  costumes, decorations.  That works out to an average 86 bucks per person.   And 24/7 Wall Street created an index to see which cities actually spend  the most on Halloween.  And this year, the top of the list: Number one,  Phoenix; right behind it, L.A., Honolulu, Burbank, and Paradise, Nevada.   Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money on candy and Halloween stuff.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's a lot of yummy candy, that's all I can say.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, are we going to have some Halloween candy onset at some  point?  </p><p> CASONE:  I'm working on it.  You know I'm on that.  You read my mind. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I figured there were some story around that.  That can get some  chocolate up here.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Whole Foods sells vegan candy corn.  I found that yesterday.   Quite delicious.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good one.  Good info.  </p><p> KELLY:  I can tell you why Phoenix is number one the list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p> KELLY:  Because of my sister, she goes by Pauline Halloween, and she makes  it the whole month and she spends -- I mean, this is her Super Bowl.  This  is, like, what she lives for every year.  So, I can -- that explains.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I was surprised its Phoenix.  I don't know why.  </p><p> KELLY:  I'm not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Some of decorations here in New York are pretty funny.  People  get into it.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  My kids are now, all three, simultaneously in college, but it  wasn't too long ago where the house was decorated stem to stern and we put  in a haunted house and all the rest of it.  And now, all of that stuff  stays in the basement because we're not at trick or treat age.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A very young French girl in my building told me that she's going  as one of the pink ladies, and she said, do you know who the pink ladies  are?  And I went, my dear, I saw Greece when it was released, at drive-in  movie theater.  And she went, what's a driving --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p> KELLY:  That's amazing.</p><p> HIGGINS:  That is funny.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, going  underground.  Elon Musk's infrastructure firm, the Boring Company gearing  up to unveil its first high-speed transit tunnel.  Details on the launch  right after this.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk out with new details about his high- speed hyperloop transport.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.   Lauren, good morning. </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Good morning, we have a date and we have a place.  So, this is  what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend: \"First tunnel almost done.\"  And  then he responded to a follower on Twitter, when: Well, \"opens December  10th.\"  His Boring Company on December 11th, will then take the public on  free rides of a tunnel track.  </p><p> Check this out, which will run in Hawthorne, California from SpaceX --  another one of Musk's company -- it's North 200th Street, then west from  there for about two miles.  It uses a loop system, which transports a car  or a vehicle, as you can see on platform, which they called the skate and  it basically skates you 150 miles an hour to your destination, no traffic,  no speeding ticket.  </p><p> When Musk first announced the boring company back in 2016 because he was  bored sitting in traffic, most people thought he was nuts.  But once again,  the visionary CEO making due on pie in the sky idea and inviting the public  to try it out for free and that maybe his way of faring well in the court  of public opinion because at least two of his tunnels face lawsuits.  </p><p> In California, they're worried about environment and what tunneling in  seismic-prone areas could do to residents' homes.  Now, Musk is also  working on a tunnel from Dodger's stadium to a nearby train station -- but  that one will not be opened for the World Series.  I know a lot of people  would appreciate that as we gear up for the big games tomorrow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  I think it's going to be great.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  An electric subterranean train station, essentially.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, but the real question is, can my face be pulled back?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes, he promised that. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  No, I'm dead serious.  His follower said, is this is going to  be like a really cool disco-like experience?  And he said, yes, so there's  going to be something cool happening in those tunnels -- it's kind of scary  if you ask me.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  So, when exactly are you trying out if the tunnels aren't yet  built?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Well, this would be taking someone -- the two or three miles to  the destination.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  OK.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, they're actually going to put people in that tunnel near  Hawthorne, California.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does anybody think Elon Musk is doing too much, given that you  have a publicly traded auto company that's struggling, largely in part  because of your own shenanigans?  So, maybe you ought to focus on one  thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And with all of that, he's just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But he's also delivering.  And then someone asked him, is he  going to be done in Elon time or real-time, and he said, I hope real-time,  but yes, he has his hands in many baskets but he is delivering on this, and  especially in Los Angeles where the traffic is terrible.  Look, this could  be the future of transportation and the future might be here and now or at  least the start of it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you listen to that Joe Rogan podcast, the whole thing, he  clearly is, like, the permitting process is impossible in Los Angeles,  right?  And so, to act like this is going to solve the problems of  commuters in Los Angeles is a bit farfetched.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But they don't have a good metro station there.  </p><p> KELLY:  I would rather ride this than go on SpaceX to Mars, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  My point is that, well, you know what, you're going to be able  to go to Mars before you can drive around to L.A. in a tunnel.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I don't know.  What do you guys think will happen?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's going to take time --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Decades.  Centuries. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- with the regulations.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  He's gotten exemptions from certain authorities to do the test  tubes of this, if you will, but you're right.  Now, they do have to come  through with the overall permitting process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Lauren, thank you.  Coming up,  still ahead, battle at the border, details on the migrant caravan with over  5,000 people in it approaching the United States, that's next hour right  here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.

That comes out this Friday.   We are watching for any news above 3 percent, if not 4 percent, which of  course was the second quarter, 4.2 percent.</p><p> This after a mixed session on Wall Street on Friday -- the market snapped a  two-day losing streak on Friday posting a slight gain on the Dow  Industrial, 65 points higher.  But the Nasdaq was lower again, down 36  points at the close on Friday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are higher again -- take a look.  FT 100 up  two thirds of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris up a third of a percent, DAX index  in Germany up two-thirds of a percent.</p><p> And in Asia overnight, gains across the board.  China had a big move --  Shanghai composite up better than 4 percent.  The government of China  revealing tax changes -- tax cuts that support a slowing economy.</p><p> Crisis at the border here in the U.S. -- the caravan makes its way to the  United States.  Now it has at least 7,000 people on it, we are told.  How  lawmakers plan to address the growing problem, coming up.</p><p> And upholding the alliance -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is headed  to Saudi Arabia this morning amid pressure to take action against the  kingdom and Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince after he -- the kingdom  admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  We have the very latest coming  up.</p><p> Awaiting the interview with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein --  Rosenstein is headed to Capitol Hill later this week.  He will testify on  Wednesday in a transcribed interview with House Judiciary Chairman, Bob  Goodlatte.  Goodlatte gave me a preview of what to expect this weekend on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA:  There is no limitation on the scope of  these questions.  We want to know in particular about the new developments  that we've been made aware of about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of  other DOJ and FBI employees and talking about the possibility of wearing a  wire when he meets with the President of the United States.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fallout later this hour, coming up.</p><p> And another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says he  wants to get something done before November -- that's eight days from now.   What it means ahead of the midterm elections to hear such an announcement.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.   Great to see you this morning.</p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Nice to be here.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to start the week off  with thinking there will be new tax cuts, right -- tax cuts 2.0, making  things permanents.  That's a great way to start the week.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HIGGINS:  It's an excellent way to go into the midterms.  </p><p> KELLY:  Oh, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump is trying to  get that economy, because that's his strongest issue -- number one in the  eyes of voters.  Because the latest Fox News poll, it was actually health  care.  And Republicans are a little bit back on their heels on the health  care issue.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  That's why he's been talking about pre-existing conditions too.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because they're running -- 50 percent of the ads that  Democrats are running are about health care.  And many of them focusing on  pre-existing conditions and trying to message that Republicans want to  remove those protections.</p><p> But in terms of the polling -- 47 percent approval rating for the President  according to the new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll -- his highest during his  time in office.  The enthusiasm gap has closed to 4 percentage points,  that's a very small advantage for the Democrats.</p><p> And to Heather's point earlier, \"The Cook Report\", nonpartisan, finds that  parties are dead even on the question of who should control Congress in  districts rated as the most competitive -- dead even.  And there was a 13  percentage point advantage for the Democrats just in the last month's poll  among registered voters.  So that advantage has disappeared.  </p><p> KELLY:  I can tell you why.  I saw an ad this weekend.  It's like do you  want Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house?  And I was like no.  I  was like -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you want Maxine Waters running the Financial Services  Committee?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you want Elijah Cummings or Jerry Nadler running the  Judiciary?  </p><p> KELLY:  That's the best ad.  It's like ok, you don't have to like us.  You  just don't want them to be in control of the House.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  In fact, when I wrote the piece publicly predicting that Trump  was going to win, when he was at his nadir that August, I said what's going  to happen to Republican voters even those who don't like how Trump talks  and don't like other things about him, they're going to look at the  alternative of what Hillary would mean in terms of continued policies, et  cetera.  And they're going to hold their noses and they're going to vote  for Trump and join the people who were voting for him.</p><p> And the same thing is going to happen with these midterm elections.  While  the spin is being put on it, which is not incorrect, that if the  Republicans lose the House, this creates a fantastic foil for Trump and  almost guarantees re-election in 2020.</p><p> The reality is, is that he wants a Republican Congress because he's running  on fulfilling his promises and getting things done, which is also going to  make him impossible to beat in 2020.  What you're seeing in the polls is  exactly what all of our work, all this year was.</p><p> And we kept saying to the Republicans, the economy alone is not going to be  your winning issue.  You're going to get really taken to the cleaners by  the left on health care and on your supposed cruelty on immigration and you  better be prepared.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It looks like the President at this point is expecting Biden to  be on the other side of the podium in 2020.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's at the top of polls in terms of Democratic contenders.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the President now has a name for him -- 1 percent, Joe -- 1  percent or something else.  The name came out this weekend.  You knew that.   Ok, well this is who the President is taking serious.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  It's also the public said this because Biden is the best known  name, right, in their heads in terms of presidential aspiration.  Over time  that's going to shift.  Biden tends to want to be anointed, not to actually  have to work for things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He also has historically had a lot of trouble fund raising.  So  that is to his disadvantage in terms of running for the Democratic  nomination -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which is what keeps Nancy Pelosi front and center in the  party.  She's a great fundraiser.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  Phenomenal.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Money talks and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes -- something else walks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- actually something else actually talks too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Our top story this hour is the looming crisis at the border --  another issue for the midterm elections.  The migrant caravan from Honduras  has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.  It  crossed into Mexico over the weekend and it sets up a potential showdown at  the U.S. border where President Trump says he will use the military if  necessary to stop these people from coming in.</p><p> Here now is Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman -- thanks  very much for joining us.</p><p> First, let me get your thoughts on this migrant caravan, your reaction to  this.  What should the U.S. do?  </p><p> REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well first of all, Maria -- good  morning to everyone.</p><p> This is indicative of the fact that the situation at the border is and has  been chaotic.  We've been saying this for years.  It's critical that the  United States secure its border, build the wall, get other technology to  make sure that our borders are safe and secure.</p><p> And this is an intolerable situation.  We cannot have throngs of people  just coming across porous borders.  It's a crisis that needs to be dealt  with now.  And it needs to be dealt with in the future.  That's why we've  got to secure our border.  That's why we've got to build the wall and make  sure that our southern border is safe.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So your colleague, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is  introducing a bill that would fully fund the President's border wall.  You  were an original co-sponsor of the bill.  Is its going to pass the house?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Sure, it will definitely pass the House.  Of course, the  arduous task has been always the Senate, the Senate the Senate.  But yes,  it will pass the House.  It's an important bill.  It gives what we wanted,  what the President wanted to fully fund the border wall.</p><p> But also, to make sure that we have other technology because it's very  important to realize that the wall can be built in certain areas but there  are other areas where the wall can't be built.  We have to use other  advanced technologies to make sure that we keep the illegal immigration  from coming across.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how much -- Kevin McCarthy says that this bill funds $23  billion, which is what's needed for the border wall because $1.5 billion  has already been accounted for.</p><p> But this weekend when I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked him  will it pass the Senate, he goes the Senate has $5 billion towards the  border wall.  He ignored the $23 billion that Kevin McCarthy is talking  about.  So where's the disconnect?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, the disconnect clearly is that the President and the  House have a much easier task to pass what they need.  The Senate, because  of the numbers, they need to get to 60, have had a lesser number. </p><p> I will say this.  If we get the McCarthy bill passed, and I think we will  in the House, it will give the Senate particularly this year an opportunity  to sit down and get that done and build the wall in a much more robust way.</p><p> Let's face it.  We did start with $5 billion, that's a start.  I actually  sit on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee and that's very important to me.  It's important  to our subcommittee.  I think it's important to most Americans.  We're  seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really  anarchistic the border situation has become.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the bottom line here in terms of the economic  proposals out of the administration.  Over the weekend, the President said  that another round of tax cuts is in the works aimed at the middle class.   Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be some time just prior I would say to November.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the status of this legislation?  I mean, you know, the  House is on -- out on recess until the midterms.  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we'll be back in November, hopefully looking forward to  a new Republican majority in both houses; but having said that it's very  important to realize that the first round of tax cuts was very important.   We had to get corporate done.  We did.  That's making America competitive  again.  We put more money in the hands of hard-working Americans.</p><p> But we need to refine it now.  Obviously it was so important to get tax  reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually very  sad.  And I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.  </p><p> This was a very good bill the first time.  We're just going to make it  better.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  But I mean the economy is growing well. </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 4.25 percent.  There's increasing worries  about the deficit.  Do we need another tax cut plan right now?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, when you look at it as an aggregate, as I've always  said, you reduce tax rates on everyone, more money actually comes into the  Treasury.  Why?  You incentivize work.  You incentivize investment.   Whether you're John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump, you realize  lower taxes means ultimately more money for the Treasury.  And I think  that's a good thing.</p><p> When we talk about deficits, we actually have to look at the spending side  of the equation and sadly really no one wants to look at that right now,  especially on the mandatory side of the equation.  Ultimately, I hope we  get there.</p><p> But if we don't have a taxing problem in America, we have a spending  problem in America.  So right now, more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans is good for the economy and good for the country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then there's Saudi Arabia and the U.S.- Saudi relations on  the line.  Secretary Mnuchin is traveling to Saudi today.  Some lawmakers  are calling for some harsh penalties against the Kingdom over its role  killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p> I spoke with Senate Armed Services Committee member Lindsey Graham  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  Here's his take.  Listen to this --  Congressman.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  I'd like  to punish those involved.  The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment,  sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this.  And I find it  impossible to believe that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So go after  him and his inner circle.</p><p> Save the alliance.  I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business  with the current leadership, MBS.  He's done to me.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Congressman?  Does MBS, the Crown Prince  need to step down?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, first of all, let me commend President Trump.  He's  handled this crisis very well.  He demanded facts, he's getting facts.   We're getting into the investigation right now.</p><p> But his response to this and he's withholding judgment on the final  punishment -- and I think that's very smart.  Looking at it this way --  Saudi Arabia is a key actor in the Middle East.  This was a tragedy.  We  can't say it any other way.  It should not have happened.  It's an  atrocity, what happened to this journalist.  </p><p> However, we have to make sure that the punishment or the sanction fits what  they did and punishes the people who are accountable, who actually did  this.  Having said that, Saudi Arabia just made a major military purchase  from the United States, they are a key actor, if you will, a key check on  Iran and other countries in the region who have been aberrant lately.  So  we've got to have a reasoned response.</p><p> And I think President Trump has handled this perfectly.  He's looking at  it.  He's concerned about it.  He's condemned it.  But he's going to make  sure that the punishment fits the crime.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in the midterms -- Congressman, in terms  of how this plays out, 15 days away?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  I'm optimistic.  Let's face it.  The Senate is trending up  very well in our great state of Tennessee.  Marsha Blackburn in a key state  is going to do very well.  I think she's going to win.  Looking across the  map, the Senate's in very good shape.</p><p> A month ago I was extremely concerned about the House.  Those competitive  House seats, though, have moved much tighter.  It's gone very well.  I  think we're going to hold the House.  It's razor-thin.</p><p> But I think Independents are going to see that the Democratic Party has  really gone off the rails.  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, like the  Republican Party, used to at least play on the same field.  The Democrats  sadly have jettisoned so far to the left -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  -- that I think the American people need to cure this and I  think Independents will do that and come out and vote for Republicans.  My  prediction -- we will hold the House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Rod Rosenstein under fire, what House Judiciary  Chairman Bob Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from the deputy  attorney general when he testifies on Wednesday.</p><p> Then steal a base, win a taco -- how you can win free food during the World  Series, coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p> An intense manhunt is underway this morning after a police officer is shot  and killed in Georgia.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well Maria -- one suspect is  already under arrest in the death of 30-year-old officer Antoine Tony.   Police say tony and other officers were responding to calls of a suspicious  vehicle.  When the officers found that car, shots were fired from inside  and one of those shots hit Tony.  Police are now searching for 18-year-old  Tafahree Maynard, wanted for murder.</p><p> Forty-two police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year.   That's already seven more than all of last year.</p><p> Well, U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is in Moscow this week for  what's expected to be some pretty tense talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin and other officials over U.S. plans to pull out of a nuclear  arms treaty.  The Kremlin says President Trump's decision is a cause for  deep concern.  It would make the world a more dangerous place.</p><p> Senator Rand Paul on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" says withdrawing from the treaty is  a bad idea.  .</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple  of months ago.  And they still regard this, this reduction of nuclear arms  and the disaster that would be nuclear war.  I don't want to see another  nuclear arms race with Russia or with any other country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, the U.S. claims that Russia has violated the agreement which  forbids the use of intermediate and short range rockets.  The Kremlin  adding the U.S. has not formally communicated its intentions to leave the  treaty to Russia.</p><p> And then there is this.  Papa John's founder, John Schnatter requesting the  company, amend its poison pill plan.  Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in  the company but he's prohibited from buying more stock until July of 2019  under a poison pill plan put in place by the board of directors.  Well  Schnatter was ousted, you may remember as chairman back in July after  racially-charged comments he made on a conference call leaked out to the  press.</p><p> Here's the stock.  Shares of Papa John's are down about 7 percent so far  this year.  And Maria -- as you can see on the chart, the pressure has been  on that stock as Schnatter's troubles have increased.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.</p><p> All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p> Coming up, a shakeup at CBS, the details as interim chairman, Richard  Parsons, is stepping down from the board now just a few weeks after  entering.</p><p> Then Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings -- we break down  those numbers.  As you can see, Hasbro now down 9 percent in the premarket.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Markets are higher ahead of the open this morning.  Investors are bracing  for the biggest week of third quarter earnings yet this week.</p><p>Dow Industrials up better than 90 points ahead of all of these earnings  coming out, a third of a percent.  We've got big names like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet -- all set to report.  Those are Nasdaq  companies.  And the Nasdaq is up this morning as you see all the numbers  coming out from a number of companies -- Caterpillar, McDonald's, also  market movers there.</p><p> Joining us now to talk more about that is Wells Fargo senior global equity  strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- it's good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us this morning.</p><p> What are your expectations for earnings and heading into the earnings  season, is it priced in to markets?  </p><p> SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Well, Maria --  good morning.</p><p> And I think what really people want to know, what the market wants to know  is -- we know these earnings are going to be good overall -- 20 percent,  maybe a little bit more than that.  But I think what the market really  wants to hear about is what's going to happen in 2019 because clearly  earnings growth in 2019 is going to be nowhere near what it is this year.</p><p> And then of course, you know, what's the cost?  What are these tariffs  doing to costs?  Is there wage pressure?  Anything that affects margins.   So I think that's what's really more important than the absolute results  because, you know, we know they're going to be good results.  </p><p> KELLY:  Scott -- it's pretty interesting what's happening in the market  right now and that's obviously the dislocations seem to be about one of  those costs and that's the rising cost of capital, right, going up.</p><p> But to me, it doesn't seem like the Fed is really, you know, making a  mistake here, given that inflation's up about 2.5 percent over the last 12  months but their Fed funds rate is still below that, so it's negative on  real terms.</p><p> Where do you see the Fed going next year?  Where do you see rates going?   And how is that going to impact where the market goes for the next year?   Because it seems if we're only up 4 percent so far this year, could we have  another year next year where it's only up a couple percent?  </p><p> WREN:  Well, I think, you know, as far as our fixed income group, they're  looking for a hike in December which I think the Fed is certainly directing  the market toward that.  They're also looking for three more next year, so  basically between now and the end of 2019, looking for four more hikes.</p><p> From an equity strategy point of view, we think that that -- you know,  that's really -- you're kind of at the red line and I think the market is  going to be very sensitive to any hint or conversation or enthusiasm out of  Jay Powell that, you know, hey, we might increase the pace here, which I  think would -- the market would not take very well.</p><p> Now, as far as the S&amp;P 500 right now, at least based on our analysis,  stocks are pretty close to fair value.  Our year-end target has been 2800  to 2900.  We're just a touch below there.  And I think probably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, you could see the S&amp;P 500 -- let's call  it 8 percent higher than where we are now.</p><p> So even though we think stocks are pretty fairly valued right now, still  think there's some upside here, still think the bull market is not over.   We still want to lean towards those sectors that are sensitive to a  continuation of the recovery.  We don't want our clients hiding right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott-- it's Dagen McDowell.  What do you make of the \"Wall  Street Journal\" highlights slowing sales growth and how that's a major head  wind for the markets?  Noting that third quarter sales are expected to be  up 7.3 percent from the same period last year, this is for the S&amp;P 500.   But that is the lowest rate for the S&amp;P in four quarters. </p><p> And Lindsey Bell has been on this program and voiced her concerns as well  about that.  </p><p> WREN:  You know, Dagen-- last quarter I have to say we were looking for  about -- in the second quarter we were looking for about 8 percent growth  and it came in close to 10 percent.  So our number for this third quarter  reporting season was 8 percent and we're a touch below that.</p><p> So, you know, I would consider really anything, you know, at this point in  the cycle, anything you know, 6 to 8 percent maybe 9 -- 6 to 9 percent  earnings growth or revenue growth, rather, I think that's good.  And I  think next year you'll probably see something at the lower end of that  range.</p><p> But I think that's what the market expects.  It's probably priced in and  really, you know, 7 percent or 8 percent earnings growth in the third  quarter I don't really think that's going to bother investors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you would put new money to work right here then, Scott?  </p><p> WREN:  Absolutely -- Maria.  You know, we're going to open this morning  basically sitting right on the 200 day moving average.  And we closed below  it a time or two over the last couple of weeks.  But right now I think  you're at a point where if you have money on the sidelines, you need to  start legging in.  And if we trade a little bit lower here, you should  continue to do that.</p><p> So if you have a certain amount of money, you know, at these levels, put a  third of it in and if we go a little bit lower, step in with another third  because if you think as I do that a trade war is unlikely, that we're going  to continue to see decent international growth that's based on what our  economists are looking at, we're going to see decent growth here in the  U.S., then the forward fundamentals look pretty good.  And we want our  clients stepping in here and getting exposure if they have cash on the  sidelines.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Scott -- we'll be watching.  Thanks so much.  Scott  Wren -- </p><p> WREN:  All right.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- joining us there from Wells Fargo.</p><p> Coming up, a college party turns into a nightmare -- The latest  developments after the floor collapses, injuring at least 30 people.</p><p> Then, demanding answers, what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein this upcoming Wednesday when Rosenstein testifies.  Back in a  moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 22nd.   Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> A higher start for the week for stock prices.  Take a look, markets are at  the highs right now, Dow Industrials set to open up about 100 points this  morning, that's almost one half of one percent higher.  NASDAQ is up three- quarters of a percent right now, that's the high of the morning, up 54  points on the NASDAQ.  And the S&amp;P is off third of a percent, 10 points  higher.  </p><p> This after a mixed day on Friday for the major indices at the close.  The  DowIndustrials were up 65 points, a quarter of a percent.  But the NASDAQ  was lower and the S&amp;P was also down one point on the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look, markets are seeing some gains here as  well.  FT-100 up almost one percent, 59 points higher.  CAC Quarante in  Paris up a half a percent, 23 points higher.  DAX Index in Germany up two- thirds of one percent, 77 points higher.  </p><p> Asian markets also closed higher overnight, China was the best performer,  Shanghai Composite up better than four percent.  The Chinese government  revealing tax cuts over the weekend to help boost an economy that has been  slowing.  </p><p> Well, stepping down, CBS board member Richard Parsons resigning under  health concerns.  We have details coming up this morning.  </p><p> And then, the party's over, a floor collapsed at Clemson University,  dropping party-goers and leaving at least 30 injured.  The latest on this  investigation coming up.  </p><p> Plus, basket brawl.  We're breaking down the Lakers, Rockets suspensions.   All that coming up.</p><p> Then this, free tacos, we will tell you about Taco Bell's promotion to give  away free food during tomorrow's World Series.  </p><p> All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein will appear before House  investigators this upcoming Wednesday.  The interview will be closed --  will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will be  transcribed.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte telling me  yesterday in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" what  investigators are looking for specifically.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We want to  know in particular about the new developments that we've been made aware of  about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees  and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the  president of the United States.  His boss, the chief executive officer of  our country.  </p><p> And the possibility of pulling together cabinet members to invoke the 25th  Amendment to the United States constitution which would be a mechanism to  declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice  president presumably serving in his place.  </p><p> These are very, very serious allegations.  We have all of this based upon a  newspaper report and we have third party testimony that we've heard in our  investigation.  We know he's met with President Trump.  President Trump has  been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two  at the Department of Justice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GOODLATTE:  But the Congress has oversight responsibility so we're going to  ask him about those questions along with many other things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial an analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  You only --  good morning.  You almost can't make this up really when you -- when you  think about it.  The people that Congressman Goodlatte's folks have  interviewed were not in the room when deputy attorney general Rosenstein  said this.  He doesn't seem to be much of as it be whether or not he said  it.  He says it was sarcastic.  Three people in the room say it was  sarcastic.  One person in the room, Andrew McCabe, fired from the FBI for  lying, said I interpret it seriously.  </p><p> The president either isn't worried about it or is biding his time until  after the midterm elections.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, there's more that's going to be on the -- on the  table obviously on Wednesday with Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Goodlatte is also looking to get to the bottom of what was said  to the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When they actually applied for a warrant to wiretap someone who  worked with the Trump campaign which of course is Carter Page.  And what  we've heard now from John Ratcliffe as well as Congressman Goodlatte is  that the Obama administration officials withheld information to the FISA  court in order to get that warrant.  Here's Bob Goodlatte on that issue.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOODLATTE:  There's a lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements  and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that.  He came into this matter at  the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal  of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court in  secret to approve a wiretap on an individual, who's a United States citizen  and this went on for a full year.  The last three months of which Mr.  Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.  So we have questions for  him about that and we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that, judge?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, I've been a very harsh critic for FISA for a  long time.  In my view, it is a corrupt way for the Justice Department to  use the lower FISA standard, probable cause of communicating with a foreign  person as opposed to the higher constitutional standard, you get a warrant,  probable cause of crime, in order to get the camel's nose under the tent.   In order to start listening to what someone is saying because they don't  have probable cause of crime but they do have probable cause of talking to  a foreign person.  Carter Page hasn't been charged with anything.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They served failed every conceivable thing about him for a  year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he was such -- he was such an enemy of the state, you would  have seen charges by now.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why the story outrages me.  And you know, the fact, what  John Ratcliffe told us is that when you have two pieces of information, you  have one thing from the unverified dossier to present to the FISA court,  then you have another piece of information that completely refutes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It refutes anything that Trump had anything to do with Russia  collusion, but they didn't present that to the FISA court.  They held that  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think -- I think you and I talked, maybe it was last week  about an experience I had on the bench where I learned that when  investigators came to me for an emergency search warrant which I signed.   They did not tell me what they also knew about it.  Years later, trying the  case, I said how did you get this -- how did you get this search warrant?   Did you tell the judge about this?  Not realizing that it was me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And I threw the charges out.  </p><p> So, the consequences of misbehavior by agents of the executive branch,  whether at the state level where I was or the federal level which is what  we're talking about, by not telling everything to the court can be  catastrophic for whatever they are trying to accomplish.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's Maria's issue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You are on the story like no one else, not just in T.V. but in  the media in general.  Because it falls by the wayside as people move on to  like out -- the outrage at the moment.  This is outrageous.  Because there  aren't any consequences.  Will anybody ever pay for doing this?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- who knows?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And let's put this in context of where we are, ia presidential  election year, the year is 2016.  You had one team wanting to spy on the  other team.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You had Hillary's team and the Obama administration saying you  know what, let's spy on Trump.  Let's do this.  And then, they get the  warrant to do so.  It's wrong.  It's disgusting.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two aspects here that we haven't talked about and that  is when the president of the United States said I'm going to release all  this FISA stuff, I haven't seen it but my people -- but my people have seen  it.  Who went to him and begged him not to?  British intelligence and  Israeli intelligence, which tells you their fingerprints are on it.  Which  tells you that through Jack Brennan the Obama administration was more  likely than not using foreign intelligence to commence its surveillance of  then candidate Trump and the people are watching them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they were just trying to do whatever they could to spy on  the political enemy.  It's as simple as that.  They wanted to spy on their  political enemy.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yet again, but it was also Susan  Rice didn't have -- she used surveillance, right?  She put in for the  application.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then unmasked everybody.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one -- I don't know this to be so.</p><p> KELLY:  This is getting back (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one that got this information to the  Washington Post.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And then they leaked it.  The strategy was  incredible.  </p><p> First, come up with this narrative, that Trump had anything to do with  Russia meddling.  Then, leak it to the media, let it -- get it into the  site guys.  Then, get informants to lure Trump people and say, Donald  Junior, let's go do a meeting, I've got this informant.  They're all  informants.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are some very angry Republicans about what Congressman  Goodlatte told you yesterday and who are they?  Republicans on the  committee that are not permitted to participate in this interrogation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan say Rosenstein's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- writing the rules for his own testimony because it was Rod  Rosenstein who said, you know what, we want two Republicans and two  Democrats in the room.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, when that happens and when it is recorded -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  on Wednesday.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  And then goes to the Intelligence Committee to  whitewash any classified material.  Then Republicans will leak their  version and Democrats will leak their version.  Yet again, instead of  letting the American people see that what the people we sent to Washington  to work for us are doing -- excuse me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  With the power we gave.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that, declassify.  And President needs --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They talked the -- they talked the president out of it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  The president needs to declassify these  documents so the American people can understand what went on here.  Is this  going to have a factor in the midterm?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  When and when and if it comes out, I think  it will be too late.  I don't -- I don't think this can -- this can come  out in the next two weeks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham also had a lot to say about this and he's going  to be doing a 13 city tour.  He's now, you know, looked at by the  Republican as the guy to sell their colleagues.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he became very popular when in the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  After Kavanaugh.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- in the midst of the Kavanaugh hearings, enough was enough,  I'm tired of this prosecutor from Arizona asking the questions, I'm tired  of what the Democrats are doing.  I'm going to take charge here and he did.   He lost his temper, or at least, it appeared that he did.  But he  galvanized a lot of the Republican base as well as all the Republicans on  the committee.  And pretty much chasing the Democrats.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because people felt like he was -- he was speaking for them.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anybody who was on the right felt the same way that Lindsey  Graham did.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think they're right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Watching these hearings.  So, whether -- and he just spoke from  his heart.  I mean, being a very blunt, passionate southerner.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I recognize that kind of behavior.  He's like enough is enough.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Are you a one passionate southerner?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm probably more prone to expletives than the senator.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  McKenzie, do we have the sound bite of Lindsey Graham?  I want  to tell you what Lindsey Graham said about the midterm elections and  specifically this investigation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The FBI investigation.  He's expecting to be the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham is.  Here's Lindsey Graham  with me yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, the House promises to  impeach the president and Kavanaugh.  I think the Republicans will continue  to try to hold the FBI and Department of Justice accountable for abuse of  power.  </p><p> If I'm the chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year, we hold the  Senate.  I promise you we're going to find out about the Simpson -- Fusion  GPS problem.  I promise you, we're going to get to the bottom of how they  used a dossier, prepared by foreign agents, paid for by the Democratic  Party to get a warrant against an American citizen.  We're not going to  turn our back on this.</p><p> If I'm chairman, we're going to get to the bottom of this.  And the only  way for me to be chairman is for us to hold the Senate.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if the Republicans hold the senate, as seems likely, if  the Democrats take the House which this morning seems likely, the two  chairs of the Judiciary Committee couldn't be more opposite.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerry Nadler.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And all the stuff that Congressman Goodlatte wants to come  out, the Democrats take the House, we'll never see it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It goes away.  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Another consequence of this midterm election.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Judge, great to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know I was kidding, McD.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know you were -- of course you were -- not really, actually.   Expletive, expletive, expletive.  You're lucky I didn't say -- you know  what, if I was really mad, I'd say --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I want to hear you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  coming up, major changes at CBS to tell you about, the details  as interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning from the company's board,  that's next.</p><p> And then a brawl on the basketball court, why three players and the lead  singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were ejected.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Get this, a college party turned into a  nightmare.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl, what a story.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  These poor kids, Maria.  About  30 people sent to the hospital after a floor suddenly gave way beneath them  during a party near the campus of Clemson University.  This happened in  South Carolina.  The whole thing captured on a party-goers iPhone.  </p><p> Yes, well, a witness says people were jumping to a popular song when the  floor just caved in.  Clemson said the police said none of the injuries are  luckily, life-threatening.  </p><p> Well, the interim chairman of CBS resigned after a month on the job due to  health issues.  Richard Parsons is stepping down after his doctors told him  to reduce his workload so he can deal with complications from multiple  myeloma.  Strauss Zelnick, another new board member is going to take over  for Parsons.  Shares of CBS are down three percent so far this year.  </p><p> Then there is this, guys, Senator Elizabeth Warren defending her decision  to take a DNA test to prove she is indeed part Native American.  So, at a  debate yesterday for her Senate seat, Warren said that she did it to,  quote:  Rebuild trust in the government through transparency.  </p><p> In March, Warren had said that no DNA test was needed to prove her claim  but she said she ultimately took the test which showed a relative six to 10  generations ago was indeed Native American.  And we played the ad for our  viewers last week, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what was -- what was that, one, 1000.  </p><p> CASONE:  Six to 10 generations.  Six grandparents ago.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  At the -- at the -- at the least, she is one, 1,024th native  American, which would put here at a lower percentage than the average  European-American in terms of the percentage of their background that is  Native American.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why are we still talking about this?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because she can't shut up about it.</p><p> KELLY:  Because Democrats --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She thinks the more she talks about it, she's somehow going to  be right.  Number one, she caved in to President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, totally.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Number one.  Number two, Harvard law school was presenting her  as their first woman of color.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, that's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In print.  Harvard law spokesman -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, she did gain them -- she gained from lying.  </p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  This is --  this is why it mattered.  As she was technically their minority person on  their faculty.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HIGGINS:  And so she deliberately traded on this part of status of -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HIGGINS:  You know, which is not knowing that it was in any way true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Are you a Taco Bell fan?  We will tell you how you  can score a free taco during the World Series, next.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are seven weeks into the NFL season.  The standings are  beginning to take shape.  Jared Max said the Chiefs are on top in the AFC.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria, the AFC really  looks like a two-team race between the Chiefs and the Patriots.  </p><p> One week after New England handed Kansas City its first loss, on the last  second field goal, Kansas City barbecued the Bengals, 45-10.   PatrickMahomes, four more touchdown passes, the Chiefs goes to 6-1, 45-10.  </p><p> Because of a snap penalty against Dallas, the Cowboy's 47-yard potential  game tying field goal became a 52-yarder.  Would have been good for 47, but  the Redskins win.  First place Redskins beat the Cowboys 20-17.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Losers, the Cowboys.  Losers.  Continue, Jared.  </p><p> MAX:  The Carolina Panthers -- the Carolina Panthers came back from 17 down  to beat the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles by three.  Panthers' Eric  Reid earlier had to be restrained before the opening coin toss.  Reid went  after the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and other players.  </p><p> Now, last year Jenkins co-founded the NFL players coalition to work with  the league on social justice issues.  Now, Jenkins no longer kneels for the  anthem.  Reid does.  And he thinks Jenkins is a sellout.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ERIC REID, SAFETY, PANTHERS:  I believe Malcolm capitalized on the  situation.  He co-opted the movement that was started by Collin to get his  organization funding.  It's cowardly.  He sold us out.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Sold them out, wow.  </p><p> And football, we have feistiness and also in the NBA.  After Saturday's  Lakers, Rockets game, became fight night at L.A. at the NBA, suspends three  players total of nine games without pay.  Chris Paul of the Rockets, two  games suspended.  He poked Rajon Rondo in the eye.  Rondo started to punch  Paul.  He got three games, one more than Paul, because he threw the first  punch and appears to have spit right at Chris Paul.  Now, this instigated  the fight.  Rondo throws a several punches and the Lakers Brandon Ingram  gets four games.  Wow.  </p><p> World Series begins tomorrow night on Fox at Fenway Park.  The Red Sox  favored to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Chris Sale will be Boston's game  one starter, likely Clayton Kershaw for L.A.  </p><p> World Series provisionally Taco Bell will give out free Doritos tacos --  free Doritos Locos Tacos, got to go crazy, for four hours on November 1st,  all we have to see is a base get stolen in the World Series and the free  Doritos Locos Tacos is yours.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, bring on the Locos Tacos.  </p><p> MAX:  Two quiero, Taco Bell.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.  What a fight there with the Lakers.  That  was --- that was not good.  Jared, thank you.  Catch Jared sports reports  on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM 115.  </p><p> Still ahead, the battle at the border.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p> CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.   Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government  revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.  </p><p> Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi  Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action  against the kingdom.  This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad  bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their  condolences.  </p><p> Plus, caravan crisis.  The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United  States border is growing.  It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on  that caravan.</p><p> On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol  Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House  investigators.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p> We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p> So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p> KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p> KELLY:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p> HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p> KELLY:  Correct.</p><p> HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p> He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p> The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p> BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p> And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p> YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p> And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p> And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p> And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p> YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p> We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p> YORK:  Correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p> The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p> ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p> YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p> We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p> Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p> HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p> YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p> The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p> And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p> The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p> President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p> However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p> HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p> So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p> We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p> The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p> Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p> And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p> OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p> Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p> European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p> The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p> All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p> Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p> FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p> FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p> FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p> FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p> FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p> FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p> FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p> FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p> FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p> FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p> FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p> FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p> FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p> FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p> News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.   Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.  I have alerted  Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency.  Must change  laws!\"  That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed  to the border of the U.S.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  When we come back, we're watching oil.  Brent  rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00  and change, what's driving this market.  Then, 15 days until midterm  elections.  The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart  Varney on that.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The economy under President Trump, the  President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections  according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p> I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p> But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p> I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p> SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p> Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p> SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p> SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning  to you.  Thank you so much.  Happy Monday.  We'll see you in a little bit,  girls.  Thank you.  It is Monday, October 27th -- October 22nd.  Good  morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Markets this morning are higher.  Here are your top stories.  6:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Fighting for gains, futures indicating the markets this morning will open  fractionally better on the session.  Dow Industrials up 25, NASDAQ up 31  right now, half a percent higher.</p><p> This after a mixed story on Wall Street on Friday.  The market snapped a  two-day losing streak, posting a slight gain on the session with the Dow  Industrials up 65 points, quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  weaker on Friday at the close.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are edging higher, take a look.  FT-100 up  a half percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of a percent, 40 points higher. </p><p> In Asia overnight, gains across the board at the close.  And as you see,  the Shanghai Composite, the best performer out of China, up better than  four percent on the session.</p><p> Stocks in china soaring.  The government revealing tax changes to help  support the slowing economy.  And with that, a multi-move across the board,  and the averages, best in four years.</p><p> Investors bracing for the busiest week of earnings season so far.  Ten Dow  Components due to report their third quarter earnings, plus technology  giants Amazon and Alphabet on deck this week.</p><p> On Friday, we get the first look at third quarter GDP.  That could be a  market mover.  We'll break it all down and we got all the preview on  earnings as well.</p><p> Another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says that  he wants to get something done before November eight days from now, what  that means ahead of the midterm elections this morning.</p><p> And upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is headed to  Saudi Arabia today, amid pressure to take action against the Kingdom after  it admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p> Senator Lindsey Graham telling me on Sunday Morning Futures he felt used by  the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he's open to keeping the arms  seal -- sales deal on track.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it impossible to believe  that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So, go after him and his inner  circle, save they alliance.</p><p> I don't mind military sales, but I cannot do business with the current  leadership.  MBS, he's done to me.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p> Plus, caravan crisis, thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into Mexico  with their sights on the U.S.A.  We're going to take you live to the border  to get an update on that caravan this morning.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  </p><p> And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and Independent Women's Voice CEO,  Heather Higgins, is here this morning.  Good to see you.</p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Thank you </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS:  It's going to be a  hectic week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hectic week because of earnings, hectic week because of?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  GDP out on Friday.  We find out how fast this country was  growing in the third quarter and if we need more tax cuts, quite frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  President said that on the campaigns trial on  Saturday, but it's also a huge week for earnings.  We've got technology in  the spotlight, Amazon and Alphabet may very well move markets.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, big time.  Especially because I'm looking forward to Verizon  tomorrow because they're going to talk about their 5G rollout.  They did it  in four different cities.  So, that's the way with the future.  </p><p> We'll see how much capital they need to put into that.  That's part of the  Infrastructure Bill.  Remember the President keeps talking about  infrastructure?  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, 5G is part of that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The GDP number on Friday, Dagen, I guess the, you know, Atlanta  Fed was all the way up at, what, four -- better than 4.5 percent, 4.8  percent or so?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  But the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where are we now on that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, the Wall Street Journal, in its estimate, so it was 4.2  percent in the second quarter, but the third quarter is expected to come in  at 3.4 percent in the preliminary reading.  A wide -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still a good number.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A widening trade gap could be a drag on third quarter GDP.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ooh.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Based on the Journal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  So good backdrop, Heather.</p><p> HIGGINS:  It is now.  And they're -- the administration's really happy with  anything over three percent just because we --- they keep saying --  everybody said even three percent was impossible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  We're so happy to have anything over three percent.  That is  great.  And so -- but they're looking at these four percent plus numbers  and they're thrilled.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you get the biggest week of third quarter earnings so far.   That's going to also show you some real growth.  That means like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent company, Alphabet, all setting to report along  with 10 Dow Components.</p><p> On the economic side, the highlight of the week, of course, is that GDP  report.  And in terms of what we're going to see in terms of market  expectations.  Pretty much baked in a better than three percent number?  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think it is.  One of the things that has weighed on  economists has been the tariffs, and so that's why the look-through into  tech earnings this week is, what have the implications been.  </p><p> Especially when you think about Apple, they come out next week.  They  haven't updated the guidance, but they said the tariffs are a tax on  consumers.  So, how is that going to impact their phone sales, especially  because they came out with new releases?  </p><p> I think it's interesting to note that technology stocks are only valued  seven percent higher than the general market.  The market's trading about  15.9 times earnings, tech's around 16.6, but they have twice the profit  margins.</p><p> So, let's see what the guidance is coming forward.  So you saw Goldman  Sachs even came out earlier this week.  I mean, last week.</p><p> They were talking about how tech isn't overvalued and that this the selloff  has been unwarranted, but it's important to note that investors have been  rotating into safer names.</p><p> They don't think we're going to get 10, 20, 30 percent returns going  forward.  They went into consumer staples stocks.  Consumer staples stocks  are up 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  Technology stocks are down 3.5 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing to also watch out for, the Wall Street Journal writes  about this in today's paper.  Slowing sales growth.</p><p> So instead of earnings, because, again, if sales growth slows -- and we  have had, according to the Journal, 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies  have reported so far.  Based on our estimates, it's actually 38 percent,  miss-sales forecasts.</p><p> If sustained, that quarterly sales miss-ratio would mark the highest so far  this year.  So again, if you're coming up short on sales for whatever  reason, whether it's higher prices that you -- you're not -- that you're  trying to pass on and people aren't buying it, whatever the reason, that  doesn't bode well for earnings growth into next year.  </p><p> And sales are only growing, are expected to grow 7.3 percent, which is  slightly lower than expectations going into this quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the guidance is going to be reflecting what the  expectations are on the trade situation, right?  On tariffs.</p><p> Because if we start -- this is when we're going to know.  I mean, companies  should probably guide us toward us, \"All right, we're going to see lower  sales than expected because of the tariffs.\"</p><p> I don't know that's the case, but I would imagine this is the quarter when  we find out if, in fact, it is going to weigh on earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the most important thing that the market's going to  focus is operating margins.  They think margins are going to come down and  be compressed because several factors.  Some of them are the rising input  costs, now we're seeing inflation's going up.  </p><p> We're also seeing labor costs are going up, costs of goods are going up.</p><p> HIGGINS:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  So the problem is this, how are they going to be able to maintain  that, if they're not able to get more productivity out of their workers?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  If you can pass on these higher costs, which like with  Unilever, some of the big consumer products companies, then that's good  news. The -- </p><p> I mean not ultimately to the customer, but it's good news for the companies  again, but it's -- again, the higher input costs, you can't -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  It's -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  For whatever reason, it's not just tariffs.  Watch a lot of  companies potentially, if they're coming up short, start to blame tariffs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're going to have to kind of comb through the -- try and  separate the fact from the fiction.</p><p> HIGGINS:  It'll be -- </p><p> KELLY:  Also the storm, they'll see that in -- about the storms, right?  So  we -- they'll think next quarter's going to be weak because of the storms,  whatever's happening.</p><p> We've seen -- Home Depot should be strong, but they actually got a  downgrade last week because they think the consumer's not going to be as  strong in upgrading their homes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, whatever weakness we see, the President's trying to  offset it now with talk of more tax cuts ahead of the election. </p><p> He spoke to reporters just this weekend about a package that they're  working on right now.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be sometime, just prior I would say to November.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, Election Day is 15 days away at this point, November  1st.  Ten days away.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He didn't say which November.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, of course, you know, Congress is out of session until  after the November Elections.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So maybe he comes out with an announcement before midterm  elections, but we're not going to see a vote, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  And quite frankly, the deficit is becoming -- it's starting  to become an issue for politicians and for the American people.</p><p> President Trump said \"I'm ordering all my cabinet secretaries to cut their  spending by 5 percent.  But discretionary spending is what one-third --  roughly one-third of the entire budget every year.  And if you cut out  defense, it's a cut -- I think it represents less than one percent of  overall spending.</p><p> So again, I don't -- he -- it would take -- it's a long road to plow in  terms of pushing through a tax cut at this point.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But we know they want to make the individual cut permanent and  we know that that's going to be on their agenda should they have the  opportunity, even after the midterm elections.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe it --I mean he said Kevin Brady is working on it.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  House, Ways and Means.  So maybe it's an announcement from  House, Ways and Means before the midterms.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  It could be.  They won't get anything passed.  But it's been  pretty clear that even though they passed the first tax cut, that even  though they were constrained by certain prior agreements to have the  individual cuts be temporary, the goal was always to make those be  permanent.</p><p> You are now seeing a recovery which, for the first time in a very long  time, is being led by blue-collar job growth, blue-collar wages, small  business confidence, rather than leading from the top.</p><p> It's sort of from the bottom.  And those people are going to be going into  the midterms looking at this fantastically booming economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Trump's approval ratings are now higher than Obama's were going  into his first midterms.  And his disapproval ratings have actually come  down, layering on a promised middle-class tax cuts can't hurt.</p><p> And -- because serious way, if you want to take on the deficit, and this  may be the one President who can cut through the swamp and actually get  this done, because the creatures on both sides of the aisle like the  current services baseline, economic gains that would never, ever be allowed  in the private sector in terms of automatic budget increases and claiming.  </p><p> Because, you know, they get to claim to these two different constituents  coming into their office and for the exact same thing, they get to claim  that they were either cutting it or increasing it because of the semantics  involved with the built-in increases.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  If you're serious about taking on the deficit, then have you to  be serious on taking on the financial accounting games that are played in  Washington.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there's Saudi Arabia on deck as well.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin now defending his decision to go to Saudi.  He's meeting  with Saudi officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p> He says the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at this critical moment.   He's not going to that conference, but this trip comes after Saudi Arabia  said that Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was in fact killed  in a fist fight inside the Istanbul Consulate.</p><p> The Kingdom is forcefully denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  Lawmakers, though, are showing  skepticism on that.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Did the Crown Prince know anything  about it?  If there were people closely tied to him involved in this  operation?</p><p> ADEL BIN AHMED AL-JUBEIR, DIPLOMAT, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:   There weren't people closely tied to him who were involved in this  operation.  This was an operation that was a rogue operation. </p><p> This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities  and responsibilities they had.</p><p> GRAHAM:  it's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to  kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it.  That would  be brazen abuse of authority.</p><p> He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in  Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I will quote the Wall Street Journal editorial today on this  very issue.  Saudi Arabia needs to step up.  We still don't know -- they  haven't produced Khashoggi's body, provided more details of precisely how  or when he decide.</p><p> The story doesn't add up.  Of the 18 people arrested, five others sacked,  several a part of Mohammed bin Salman the inner circle.  It's unlikely they  would have acted alone without at least, you know, feeling a tacit assent  from the Crown Prince.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal editorial goes on to write, \"The U.S. goal should  be to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear that  murdering journalists is unacceptable and that Mohammed bin Salman's  erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral  relationship.\"</p><p> We can't dictate what King Salman will do about who should run Saudi  Arabia, but you can -- but Mohammed bin Salman also can't be allowed to  conclude that America thinks this is no big deal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they've got to do something.  The U.S. has to do  something to push back in the face of this heinous situation.</p><p> Question is, does Mohammed bin Salman survive?  He's got two other sons.   There are a lot of people who want this guy out at this point.  Lindsey  Graham included.</p><p> So big question here, you know, I mean, the arms sales is going -- it's  going to go through.  The relationship is going to go through because  there's one big black eye here that we're faced with and that is Iran, so.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the muddled response from this administration and the uneven  response that we've seen since this all began, we need to be on very firm  footing about the message, like Lindsey Graham said that we send to King  Salman about who we -- who should run the country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  I want to disagree.  I think that the administration has been  taking a difficult situation.  These are people that behaved really badly,  like so many of the people we've had to deal with.  And they've got this  challenge of how do you negotiate making them pay for it, making them fess  up to it, but not having them lose so much for -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But comparing it to Brett Kavanaugh was a misstep.  I'm sorry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  </p><p> When we come back, it's shifting gears for FiatChrysler.  Details on the  automaker's roughly $7 billion car parts deal.  That's next.  </p><p> And then a spooky box office debut, we've got it here on Halloween.  Stay  with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Battle at the border for sure, a migrant caravan  moving toward the United States.  It has grown now to roughly 5,000 people.   Griff Jenkins is live in McAllen, Texas this morning with details there,  right in the middle of it.  Griff.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  When the  caravan gets to this border, if they do indeed come here, they're going to  find an overwhelmed border already with illegal crossing.  </p><p> And the Rio Grande Valley Sector where I'm standing McAllen is the busiest  sector of the entire U.S. border, and it had more than 12,700 illegal  crossing arrests in just the last three weeks.  </p><p> Over the weekend, over 800 pounds of marijuana confiscated, and it is part  of the problem here they're seeing is also family units, women and children  coming, much like the caravan of migrants from Central American countries.</p><p> We spent time yesterday with the Sector Chief, a guy named Manuel Padilla,  talking about the caravan that's coming and what he says is a need for more  infrastructure.  Take a listen.</p><p> MANUEL PADILLA, CHIEF, RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR:  If we had this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure throughout my border,  we would truly transform this area.  It's a win-win situation for  everybody.</p><p> This area right here, we do not see MS-13, we do not see criminal aliens  coming into this area, because of the capability that we have through this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure.</p><p> JENKINS:  But he's only got well and about 55 of the nearly 300 parts of  this sector and it's a busy one.  The President, Maria, will be in Houston  today and Houston is in this RGV area.  I'm sure this topic will certainly  come up.  Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins is live  McAllen, Texas.  </p><p> What a scene.  We are going to be watching that as that caravan moves  closer to where Griff is actually standing.</p><p> Switching gears, a deadly train derailment in Taiwan.  Cheryl Casone with  that right now in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, good morning.</p><p> An express train went off the tracks, killing at least 18 people.  This  happened in Eastern Taiwan.  More than 150 others were injured in this  disaster.  Witnesses say all eight of the train's carriages went off the  rails as it was traveling to the eastern city of Taitung.</p><p> This comes a year after another express train on the same line derailed.   The cause of yesterday's accident, under investigation.</p><p> Well, Fiat Chrysler is unloading its car parts business.  The company is  selling the unit to Japan's Calsonic Kansei for just over $7 billion.   Calsonic is owned by the U.S. private-equity firm, KKR.  The deal is going  to make the newly-combined company one of the world's biggest auto parts  suppliers.</p><p> The FiatChrysler- - excuse me -- in the premarket up 4.6 percent, about.</p><p> And then finally, there is this.  The horror movie, \"Halloween,\" making a  killing at the box office this weekend.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this  night.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been preparing for this for a long time. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is not safe to be on the streets tonight.  Go  home!  Get out of here!  Get inside!  Michael?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The film raking in $77.5 million, a record opening for the  franchise.  It also is the second-best October opening weekend of all time. </p><p> Holding on to second place, in its third weekend, \"A Star Is Born,\" $19.3  million.  </p><p> Rounding out top five, last week's big winner was \"Venom,\" followed by \"  Goosebumps 2:  Haunted Halloween,\" and, Maria, \"First Man.\"  </p><p> Jamie Curtis, she's still got it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, she does.  Good movies this weekend.  Thanks, Cheryl. </p><p> Coming up, a new way to calculate your FICO score, we will tell you why  your cash may help.  That's next.</p><p> And then Facebook goes shopping.  The technology giant's reported plan to  purchase a cybersecurity company, all right here after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Increasing access to credit, Fair Isaac, the  company behind the FICO score, is rolling out a major change, UltraFICO  Score will go beyond payment history.</p><p> According to the Journal this morning, it will factor in bank account  activity, how consumers manage their cash and checking, savings and money  market accounts.  It launches next year. </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Mark Hamrick.  He's  Bankrate.com's Senior Economic Analyst.  </p><p> And Mark, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining  us.  </p><p> MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you think this is about younger people, this new FICO  change.  Tell us about it.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Primarily, and we think about the fact that there's a large  portion of the U.S. population which really isn't doing business with  traditional financial service companies.  Millennial have been smart.   They're saving more money.</p><p> Our recent Bankrate survey found that about two-thirds of the American  public was essentially limiting its spending and millennials are doing the  best job of saving more money so that money is sitting in accounts not  necessarily being spent.</p><p> At Bankrate, we say that the two biggest problems that have been identified  by Americans is their failure to save for retirement and for emergencies.   So, financial companies want to create new customers and help connect them  to borrowing products.  It's a logical step for them.</p><p> KELLY:  Is there a way to opt out of this?  It's -- the last thing I want  with the Equifax hacking and everything going on about security, the last  thing I want is somebody to pull up my UltraFICO to see how much money --  cash I have in a bank account, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how you're managing all your money, and all your accounts.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Savings, checking.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Yes.  Well, to the question, I think you're right on.  I think  Americans are tired of having their personal information essentially taken  from them.  </p><p> And I think this is going to be something to watch in terms of regulation  in the coming years, whether it's the information that Facebook and Google  possess about us or our credit rating scores, because I think we have a  sense that we have no control over this information.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the -- with the -- this new FICO score, is this a way  to essentially offer people even more credit, if you will, that this is at  a time when people are increasingly stretched, that you've seen auto  lending particularly on the fringes of people with very low subprime auto  lending really being pulled back on?  </p><p> Is this a way to basically shine up people's credit scores and make them  more palatable to the lender?  </p><p> HAMRICK:  That's a very good question.  I think that is essentially the  tension that could be created by this.  In other words, giving loans to  people who are not well qualified. </p><p> But that, I don't think, is the intention.  Most financial service firms  are not looking to create new losses.</p><p> Fed Chair Powell has said that he thinks that household balance sheets are  in good shape.  He's more concerned about the commercial side.</p><p> So, I think this is more about trying to identify good data about consumers  and potential borrowers and connecting them to products that they might  find useful.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Meanwhile, you've got a new survey on how Americans are spending,  and if they're cutting back on spending, right?  Let's talk about that.  </p><p> Sixty-six percent say that they're living -- they're limiting spending,  thirty-six percent say that they are doing it to save money.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Yes, and I think this is a good thing.  As I said, you know, I  don't think there are many Americans that go essentially into their last  days saying, \"You know what, I saved too much money.\"  Ii think more  Americans regret that they didn't do a better job of saving for retirement  or emergencies.</p><p> HIGGINS:  And I think that 36 percent was only of the 66 percent that were  saving.  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Right.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  So it was only 24 percent overall that we're saving for longer  term.</p><p> The other thing that was interesting in the study was, there has long been  a contention that the big difference between how well you do in life is how  long your time horizon is.</p><p> And when you looked at the study, the people who were making over $50,000  clearly had a longer time horizon that they were saving for, whereas the  people who were under that were just sort of saving for the short-term  needs and they weren't thinking beyond that.</p><p> How, if we're going to move away from the Keynesian mentality, that the  more debt you have and the more spending you have, the better off we all  are, to one where people are more prudent and thinking about their savings,  how is borrowing going to help that happen?</p><p> HAMRICK:  I think essentially, it's two different questions.  I think the  first question is, as long as you have a healthy economy, most Americans  will be mindful of trying to achieve proper financial goals.</p><p> I do think in our society, we have a significant problem with lack of  financial literacy and that's an education issue, which i don't hear a lot  of people talking about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's too bad.  It really just starts at home.  But we're  certainly interested in that.</p><p> HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mark, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you this morning.  Mark Hamrick joining us from  Bankrate.com.  </p><p> Take a short break.  When we come back, Jamie Dimon's big bet, why J.P.  Morgan is building a campus in Silicon Valley.  That's coming up.</p><p> Then fixing traffic gridlock, details on Elon Musk's high-speed transit  tunnel.  It's nearly finished.  Will it offer free rides to the public?  We  will tell you about that.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, October  22nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  The major  indices on Wall Street looking to open higher this morning ahead of a big  week for earnings.  This right here is the high of the morning, up 73  points on the Dow Industrials, a quarter of a percent.  The NASDAQ is up  two-thirds of a percent, that's 42 points higher.  This after a mixed close  on Friday, all ahead of a big week in earnings.  This is one of the busiest  weeks we're going to see.  </p><p>Dow Industrials, on Friday, up 65 points at the close, a quarter of a  percent higher.  The S&amp;P500 was flat, down one point; and the NASDAQ was  lower by half a percent, 36 points lower on NASDAQ on Friday.  In Europe  this morning, take a look at indices, higher across the board.  FT-100 up  two-thirds of one percent; CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent;  and the DAX Index in Germany, up two-thirds of one percent right now.   Asian markets closed higher overnight.  The Shanghai Composite was up  strong, up four percent.  China's government revealing tax cuts over the  weekend to help boost that economy which has shown slowdown.  </p><p>Facebook is eyeing, shoring up its security.  The company reportedly  looking to make an acquisition in cyber sector.  Plus, the company faces  request a from Japan to beef up security.  Building the future.  Details on  JPMorgan Chase's newest investment in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you  what's behind that move.  And then a rare -- a rare reality.  Elon Musk  tweeting out date for his hyperloop transport.  When you can expect to take  a ride on a high-speed rail, from Elon Musk?  And forget getting candies in  your trick or treat bags.  We've got the very list of the U.S. cities  spending the most on Halloween this year -- it might surprise you.  </p><p> First though, our top story this half an hour.  Countdown to midterm  elections now 15 days away.  President Trump and former President Obama  squaring off in dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  President Trump will hit the campaign trail  in Houston in support of Ted Cruz, while former President Obama will  touchdown in Las Vegas and campaign there.  Enthusiasm for President Trump  is high, lines of supporters are already covering entire blocks as nearly  100,000 people wait to enter venue that can hold 18,000.  18,000 is what  the capacity is.  </p><p> Yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham to get his take on the most important issues on the ballot  this November.  President Trump has hand-picked Senator Graham to go out  and campaign for colleagues.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRAHAM:  I think people are going to be voting on the mob rule of the  Democratic Party.  If you like Democrats around the House, you know exactly  what you're going to get: They're going to try and impeach the president,  impeach Kavanaugh; they don't care about your wallet, they just want to get  in your wallet.  </p><p> If you keep Republicans in charge, we're going to keep the economy moving  forward, we're going to secure our border, we're going to deal with our  enemies throughout the world, we're going to rebuild our military.  And  when it comes to standing up to the world, you need a strong leader like  President Trump, and the Democratic Party has showed us what they would do  with power, not much for you.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the president has asked Lindsey Graham to go on the road;  he's going to talk -- he's going to be in 13 cities in just a couple of  days.  Joining us right now is Republican Strategist Kimberly Klacik.   Kimberly, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.   Your reaction to Senator Graham and what you might expect from him in the  next couple of days as he travels to 13 cities to campaign?  </p><p> KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I see this new Lindsey Graham that  we've been seeing, I expect good things.  I mean, he's absolutely right.   You know exactly what you're going to get if the Democrats take over the  House.  They have been intolerant lately.  The mob -- the mob name actually  fits them properly.  And I think for a lot of people, we don't really  understand whether or not there is a blue wave coming.  I'm not convinced.   In 2016, everyone said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, we saw that  Trump won and that's basically because people were afraid to show support  for Trump, so I don't think we really know what's going to happen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The president's new line lately in his campaigns have been  \"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.\"  We saw that mob- thinking again this weekend when Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao  were harassed while they were at dinner, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, and there was a panel in MSNBC that essentially justifies  this kind of behavior base on the fact that Merrick Garland didn't get a  vote in front of the Senate under Mitch McConnell.  That was -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, it's justified.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, that that's justified.  And they're -- the message from  the Democrats is \"we are coming for you.\"  If you support Trump, we're  going to show up at your place of work, where you eat, where you live.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how do you deny that's not the mob?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It is the mob.  I think that that's a great slogan.  He's --  President Trump is also really focused on immigration, attention to the  border wall, and in fact, I know that Joe Donnelly who is a Democrat  running for election in Indiana has actually running ads promoting his  support of President Trump on immigration -- border wall.  And radical left  talking about abolishing ICE.  So, smart Democrats like Donnelly in  Indiana, they know that this is an important issue to Americans.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because -- and then you've got Kevin McCathy bringing the  bill to the floor right after midterms, Kimberly, to build the wall,  enforce the law -- act, that's what it is.  And voter interest in this  election has surged today record highs in both parties.  A new Wall Street  Journal/NBC News poll finds that nearly two-thirds of registered voters say  they are very interested in this year's midterms, that's the highest ever  recorded by the survey.  President Trump's job approval rating, as we just  heard, got a boost, the poll finds that approval rating now at 47 percent.   This is the highest of his time in office, Kimberly, going into these  midterm elections, what are your thoughts?  </p><p> KLACIK:  Yes, and it's well deserved.  You see, President Trump -- I don't  think the Democrats have identified that he's done anything wrong.  You  have to remember, usually, Democrats run on making promises, usually  promises they can't keep.  And so, right now, you have a bunch of problems  that Trump is solving on his own.  People were talking about immigration  and they should, because this is really a threat on our national security.   It's not about not wanting people to come in and live for the American  dream.  So, yes, they are absolutely right about this, and I think that is  why there's overwhelming support right now for President Trump, because  there's a lot of people on his side here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you know, Heather, when you look at these pictures of  this caravan making its way to the United States, it is just perfect timing  going into the midterm elections because it's a reminder that the president  is trying to secure the borders and have legal immigration.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  The caravan is the single largest one picture argument for a wall  that Trump could have ever asked for.  And particularly, when you see the  soldiers in Guatemala or the police there trying to stop it and getting  overrun on the fences, getting overrun --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HIGGINS:  What's interesting about the poll that just came out, I've been  saying from the beginning that there was not going to be a blue wave and  that the Republicans, actually, I will predict will keep the House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  And the poll has been interesting in that is now down to a nine- point Democrat advantage in the generic, but if you look in the  battleground states, it is completely even now.  I think, I think it is not  going to be the blue wave, I think it's going to be a major red wall, and  there's going to be more pick-ups in the Senate as well as holding of the  House.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know I'm talking out both sides in my mouth, one problem,  though, in President Trump making immigration a front and center issue,  talking about the wall is the fact that the Republicans in control of the  Senate and the House didn't fully fund his wall, and they didn't basically  starve the sanctuary cities of money.  This is another can that's been  kicked down the road after midterms, so in some way, he's highlighting what  the Republicans haven't gotten done, but they haven't fulfilled agenda on  this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely right.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Exactly.  This has been the biggest problem that Republicans have  had to overcome is their failure to follow through on things that they  promised to do, whether it was health care or taking on sanctuary cities or  border wall funding, I think part of the reason that you saw the tremendous  lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters until the Kavanaugh hearings was  that there was this disjunction, what had been promised versus what had  been delivered in the general sense of why would I bother voting for you?   Kavanaugh made it very clear why you would bother voting for them because  the alternative was much worse.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, now, Donald Trump just gave them another reason and that's  tax cut 2.0.  So, if you think about it, no better way to mobilize people  to vote than tell them you're going to do tax cut 2.0 a couple of weeks  before election.  So, I think that timing was perfect and he's now throwing  the Democrats in a (INAUDIBLE), because he's going to make them start  talking about taxes and has done very well for Republicans.  </p><p> BARTIROMO: And let not forget -- let's not forget, Kimberly, not one  Democrat voted for that tax cut plan.  </p><p> KLACIK:  Yes, that's true.  So, how much are they really for the American  people?  I think that right now this is the perfect storm, like you said  the caravan coming is the perfect storm.  We have to remember, do we really  want people in our country, as the first thing they do when they get here  is break our laws?  We are a nation of laws and we deserve to know who our  neighbors are, and we should be vetting legal immigrants.  I think,  honestly, I don't see the blue wave either.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kimberly, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p> KLACIK:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kimberly Klacik joining us there.  Coming up, doubling down on  data protection, details on Facebook's reported plans to purchase a  cybersecurity company, that's next.  And then getting into the Halloween  spirit, we will tell you the city spending the most money on Halloween  ahead of October 31.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New pressure this morning on Facebook over data  protection, Cheryl Casone on it in headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, the Japanese government has ordered Facebook to better  protect user data.  Japan's asking the company to fully communicate  security issues to its users and inform regulators of any change in  security measures.  This, of course, comes after Facebook said earlier this  month, hackers stole information of about 30 million people.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly planning to go buy a major cybersecurity  firm.  Reports say Facebook has approached several companies for a  potential acquisition.  Taking a look at shares of the company down 13  percent so far this year, there's Facebook.  </p><p> Well, JPMorgan Chase is planning to build a new campus that's going to  focus on Fintech or Financial Technology.  This campus is going to be out  in Silicon Valley.  More than 1,000 employees are going to work at the  campus when it opens up in Palo Alto in 2020.  A project part of an effort  by JPMorgan to keep up with changes in digital payments which is big  business.  Most of the employers are going to work for JPMorgan Chase's  merchant services division.  Shares of JPMorgan are up nearly one percent  so far this year.  </p><p> And Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry in the United States.   So, this year, Americans are expected to spend $9 billion on candy,  costumes, decorations.  That works out to an average 86 bucks per person.   And 24/7 Wall Street created an index to see which cities actually spend  the most on Halloween.  And this year, the top of the list: Number one,  Phoenix; right behind it, L.A., Honolulu, Burbank, and Paradise, Nevada.   Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money on candy and Halloween stuff.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's a lot of yummy candy, that's all I can say.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, are we going to have some Halloween candy onset at some  point?  </p><p> CASONE:  I'm working on it.  You know I'm on that.  You read my mind. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I figured there were some story around that.  That can get some  chocolate up here.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Whole Foods sells vegan candy corn.  I found that yesterday.   Quite delicious.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good one.  Good info.  </p><p> KELLY:  I can tell you why Phoenix is number one the list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p> KELLY:  Because of my sister, she goes by Pauline Halloween, and she makes  it the whole month and she spends -- I mean, this is her Super Bowl.  This  is, like, what she lives for every year.  So, I can -- that explains.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I was surprised its Phoenix.  I don't know why.  </p><p> KELLY:  I'm not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Some of decorations here in New York are pretty funny.  People  get into it.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  My kids are now, all three, simultaneously in college, but it  wasn't too long ago where the house was decorated stem to stern and we put  in a haunted house and all the rest of it.  And now, all of that stuff  stays in the basement because we're not at trick or treat age.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A very young French girl in my building told me that she's going  as one of the pink ladies, and she said, do you know who the pink ladies  are?  And I went, my dear, I saw Greece when it was released, at drive-in  movie theater.  And she went, what's a driving --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p> KELLY:  That's amazing.</p><p> HIGGINS:  That is funny.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, going  underground.  Elon Musk's infrastructure firm, the Boring Company gearing  up to unveil its first high-speed transit tunnel.  Details on the launch  right after this.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk out with new details about his high- speed hyperloop transport.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.   Lauren, good morning. </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Good morning, we have a date and we have a place.  So, this is  what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend: \"First tunnel almost done.\"  And  then he responded to a follower on Twitter, when: Well, \"opens December  10th.\"  His Boring Company on December 11th, will then take the public on  free rides of a tunnel track.  </p><p> Check this out, which will run in Hawthorne, California from SpaceX --  another one of Musk's company -- it's North 200th Street, then west from  there for about two miles.  It uses a loop system, which transports a car  or a vehicle, as you can see on platform, which they called the skate and  it basically skates you 150 miles an hour to your destination, no traffic,  no speeding ticket.  </p><p> When Musk first announced the boring company back in 2016 because he was  bored sitting in traffic, most people thought he was nuts.  But once again,  the visionary CEO making due on pie in the sky idea and inviting the public  to try it out for free and that maybe his way of faring well in the court  of public opinion because at least two of his tunnels face lawsuits.  </p><p> In California, they're worried about environment and what tunneling in  seismic-prone areas could do to residents' homes.  Now, Musk is also  working on a tunnel from Dodger's stadium to a nearby train station -- but  that one will not be opened for the World Series.  I know a lot of people  would appreciate that as we gear up for the big games tomorrow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  I think it's going to be great.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  An electric subterranean train station, essentially.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, but the real question is, can my face be pulled back?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes, he promised that. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  No, I'm dead serious.  His follower said, is this is going to  be like a really cool disco-like experience?  And he said, yes, so there's  going to be something cool happening in those tunnels -- it's kind of scary  if you ask me.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  So, when exactly are you trying out if the tunnels aren't yet  built?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Well, this would be taking someone -- the two or three miles to  the destination.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  OK.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, they're actually going to put people in that tunnel near  Hawthorne, California.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does anybody think Elon Musk is doing too much, given that you  have a publicly traded auto company that's struggling, largely in part  because of your own shenanigans?  So, maybe you ought to focus on one  thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And with all of that, he's just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But he's also delivering.  And then someone asked him, is he  going to be done in Elon time or real-time, and he said, I hope real-time,  but yes, he has his hands in many baskets but he is delivering on this, and  especially in Los Angeles where the traffic is terrible.  Look, this could  be the future of transportation and the future might be here and now or at  least the start of it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you listen to that Joe Rogan podcast, the whole thing, he  clearly is, like, the permitting process is impossible in Los Angeles,  right?  And so, to act like this is going to solve the problems of  commuters in Los Angeles is a bit farfetched.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But they don't have a good metro station there.  </p><p> KELLY:  I would rather ride this than go on SpaceX to Mars, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  My point is that, well, you know what, you're going to be able  to go to Mars before you can drive around to L.A. in a tunnel.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I don't know.  What do you guys think will happen?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's going to take time --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Decades.  Centuries. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- with the regulations.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  He's gotten exemptions from certain authorities to do the test  tubes of this, if you will, but you're right.  Now, they do have to come  through with the overall permitting process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Lauren, thank you.  Coming up,  still ahead, battle at the border, details on the migrant caravan with over  5,000 people in it approaching the United States, that's next hour right  here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

We want to know in particular about the new developments  that we've been made aware of about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of  other DOJ and FBI employees and talking about the possibility of wearing a  wire when he meets with the President of the United States.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fallout later this hour, coming up.</p><p> And another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says he  wants to get something done before November -- that's eight days from now.   What it means ahead of the midterm elections to hear such an announcement.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.   Great to see you this morning.</p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Nice to be here.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to start the week off  with thinking there will be new tax cuts, right -- tax cuts 2.0, making  things permanents.  That's a great way to start the week.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HIGGINS:  It's an excellent way to go into the midterms.  </p><p> KELLY:  Oh, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump is trying to  get that economy, because that's his strongest issue -- number one in the  eyes of voters.  Because the latest Fox News poll, it was actually health  care.  And Republicans are a little bit back on their heels on the health  care issue.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  That's why he's been talking about pre-existing conditions too.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because they're running -- 50 percent of the ads that  Democrats are running are about health care.  And many of them focusing on  pre-existing conditions and trying to message that Republicans want to  remove those protections.</p><p> But in terms of the polling -- 47 percent approval rating for the President  according to the new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll -- his highest during his  time in office.  The enthusiasm gap has closed to 4 percentage points,  that's a very small advantage for the Democrats.</p><p> And to Heather's point earlier, \"The Cook Report\", nonpartisan, finds that  parties are dead even on the question of who should control Congress in  districts rated as the most competitive -- dead even.  And there was a 13  percentage point advantage for the Democrats just in the last month's poll  among registered voters.  So that advantage has disappeared.  </p><p> KELLY:  I can tell you why.  I saw an ad this weekend.  It's like do you  want Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house?  And I was like no.  I  was like -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you want Maxine Waters running the Financial Services  Committee?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you want Elijah Cummings or Jerry Nadler running the  Judiciary?  </p><p> KELLY:  That's the best ad.  It's like ok, you don't have to like us.  You  just don't want them to be in control of the House.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  In fact, when I wrote the piece publicly predicting that Trump  was going to win, when he was at his nadir that August, I said what's going  to happen to Republican voters even those who don't like how Trump talks  and don't like other things about him, they're going to look at the  alternative of what Hillary would mean in terms of continued policies, et  cetera.  And they're going to hold their noses and they're going to vote  for Trump and join the people who were voting for him.</p><p> And the same thing is going to happen with these midterm elections.  While  the spin is being put on it, which is not incorrect, that if the  Republicans lose the House, this creates a fantastic foil for Trump and  almost guarantees re-election in 2020.</p><p> The reality is, is that he wants a Republican Congress because he's running  on fulfilling his promises and getting things done, which is also going to  make him impossible to beat in 2020.  What you're seeing in the polls is  exactly what all of our work, all this year was.</p><p> And we kept saying to the Republicans, the economy alone is not going to be  your winning issue.  You're going to get really taken to the cleaners by  the left on health care and on your supposed cruelty on immigration and you  better be prepared.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It looks like the President at this point is expecting Biden to  be on the other side of the podium in 2020.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's at the top of polls in terms of Democratic contenders.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the President now has a name for him -- 1 percent, Joe -- 1  percent or something else.  The name came out this weekend.  You knew that.   Ok, well this is who the President is taking serious.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  It's also the public said this because Biden is the best known  name, right, in their heads in terms of presidential aspiration.  Over time  that's going to shift.  Biden tends to want to be anointed, not to actually  have to work for things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He also has historically had a lot of trouble fund raising.  So  that is to his disadvantage in terms of running for the Democratic  nomination -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which is what keeps Nancy Pelosi front and center in the  party.  She's a great fundraiser.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  Phenomenal.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Money talks and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes -- something else walks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- actually something else actually talks too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Our top story this hour is the looming crisis at the border --  another issue for the midterm elections.  The migrant caravan from Honduras  has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.  It  crossed into Mexico over the weekend and it sets up a potential showdown at  the U.S. border where President Trump says he will use the military if  necessary to stop these people from coming in.</p><p> Here now is Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman -- thanks  very much for joining us.</p><p> First, let me get your thoughts on this migrant caravan, your reaction to  this.  What should the U.S. do?  </p><p> REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well first of all, Maria -- good  morning to everyone.</p><p> This is indicative of the fact that the situation at the border is and has  been chaotic.  We've been saying this for years.  It's critical that the  United States secure its border, build the wall, get other technology to  make sure that our borders are safe and secure.</p><p> And this is an intolerable situation.  We cannot have throngs of people  just coming across porous borders.  It's a crisis that needs to be dealt  with now.  And it needs to be dealt with in the future.  That's why we've  got to secure our border.  That's why we've got to build the wall and make  sure that our southern border is safe.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So your colleague, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is  introducing a bill that would fully fund the President's border wall.  You  were an original co-sponsor of the bill.  Is its going to pass the house?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Sure, it will definitely pass the House.  Of course, the  arduous task has been always the Senate, the Senate the Senate.  But yes,  it will pass the House.  It's an important bill.  It gives what we wanted,  what the President wanted to fully fund the border wall.</p><p> But also, to make sure that we have other technology because it's very  important to realize that the wall can be built in certain areas but there  are other areas where the wall can't be built.  We have to use other  advanced technologies to make sure that we keep the illegal immigration  from coming across.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how much -- Kevin McCarthy says that this bill funds $23  billion, which is what's needed for the border wall because $1.5 billion  has already been accounted for.</p><p> But this weekend when I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked him  will it pass the Senate, he goes the Senate has $5 billion towards the  border wall.  He ignored the $23 billion that Kevin McCarthy is talking  about.  So where's the disconnect?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, the disconnect clearly is that the President and the  House have a much easier task to pass what they need.  The Senate, because  of the numbers, they need to get to 60, have had a lesser number. </p><p> I will say this.  If we get the McCarthy bill passed, and I think we will  in the House, it will give the Senate particularly this year an opportunity  to sit down and get that done and build the wall in a much more robust way.</p><p> Let's face it.  We did start with $5 billion, that's a start.  I actually  sit on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee and that's very important to me.  It's important  to our subcommittee.  I think it's important to most Americans.  We're  seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really  anarchistic the border situation has become.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the bottom line here in terms of the economic  proposals out of the administration.  Over the weekend, the President said  that another round of tax cuts is in the works aimed at the middle class.   Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be some time just prior I would say to November.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the status of this legislation?  I mean, you know, the  House is on -- out on recess until the midterms.  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we'll be back in November, hopefully looking forward to  a new Republican majority in both houses; but having said that it's very  important to realize that the first round of tax cuts was very important.   We had to get corporate done.  We did.  That's making America competitive  again.  We put more money in the hands of hard-working Americans.</p><p> But we need to refine it now.  Obviously it was so important to get tax  reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually very  sad.  And I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.  </p><p> This was a very good bill the first time.  We're just going to make it  better.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  But I mean the economy is growing well. </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 4.25 percent.  There's increasing worries  about the deficit.  Do we need another tax cut plan right now?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, when you look at it as an aggregate, as I've always  said, you reduce tax rates on everyone, more money actually comes into the  Treasury.  Why?  You incentivize work.  You incentivize investment.   Whether you're John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump, you realize  lower taxes means ultimately more money for the Treasury.  And I think  that's a good thing.</p><p> When we talk about deficits, we actually have to look at the spending side  of the equation and sadly really no one wants to look at that right now,  especially on the mandatory side of the equation.  Ultimately, I hope we  get there.</p><p> But if we don't have a taxing problem in America, we have a spending  problem in America.  So right now, more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans is good for the economy and good for the country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then there's Saudi Arabia and the U.S.- Saudi relations on  the line.  Secretary Mnuchin is traveling to Saudi today.  Some lawmakers  are calling for some harsh penalties against the Kingdom over its role  killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p> I spoke with Senate Armed Services Committee member Lindsey Graham  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  Here's his take.  Listen to this --  Congressman.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  I'd like  to punish those involved.  The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment,  sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this.  And I find it  impossible to believe that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So go after  him and his inner circle.</p><p> Save the alliance.  I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business  with the current leadership, MBS.  He's done to me.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Congressman?  Does MBS, the Crown Prince  need to step down?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, first of all, let me commend President Trump.  He's  handled this crisis very well.  He demanded facts, he's getting facts.   We're getting into the investigation right now.</p><p> But his response to this and he's withholding judgment on the final  punishment -- and I think that's very smart.  Looking at it this way --  Saudi Arabia is a key actor in the Middle East.  This was a tragedy.  We  can't say it any other way.  It should not have happened.  It's an  atrocity, what happened to this journalist.  </p><p> However, we have to make sure that the punishment or the sanction fits what  they did and punishes the people who are accountable, who actually did  this.  Having said that, Saudi Arabia just made a major military purchase  from the United States, they are a key actor, if you will, a key check on  Iran and other countries in the region who have been aberrant lately.  So  we've got to have a reasoned response.</p><p> And I think President Trump has handled this perfectly.  He's looking at  it.  He's concerned about it.  He's condemned it.  But he's going to make  sure that the punishment fits the crime.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in the midterms -- Congressman, in terms  of how this plays out, 15 days away?  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  I'm optimistic.  Let's face it.  The Senate is trending up  very well in our great state of Tennessee.  Marsha Blackburn in a key state  is going to do very well.  I think she's going to win.  Looking across the  map, the Senate's in very good shape.</p><p> A month ago I was extremely concerned about the House.  Those competitive  House seats, though, have moved much tighter.  It's gone very well.  I  think we're going to hold the House.  It's razor-thin.</p><p> But I think Independents are going to see that the Democratic Party has  really gone off the rails.  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, like the  Republican Party, used to at least play on the same field.  The Democrats  sadly have jettisoned so far to the left -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  -- that I think the American people need to cure this and I  think Independents will do that and come out and vote for Republicans.  My  prediction -- we will hold the House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Rod Rosenstein under fire, what House Judiciary  Chairman Bob Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from the deputy  attorney general when he testifies on Wednesday.</p><p> Then steal a base, win a taco -- how you can win free food during the World  Series, coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p> An intense manhunt is underway this morning after a police officer is shot  and killed in Georgia.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well Maria -- one suspect is  already under arrest in the death of 30-year-old officer Antoine Tony.   Police say tony and other officers were responding to calls of a suspicious  vehicle.  When the officers found that car, shots were fired from inside  and one of those shots hit Tony.  Police are now searching for 18-year-old  Tafahree Maynard, wanted for murder.</p><p> Forty-two police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year.   That's already seven more than all of last year.</p><p> Well, U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is in Moscow this week for  what's expected to be some pretty tense talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin and other officials over U.S. plans to pull out of a nuclear  arms treaty.  The Kremlin says President Trump's decision is a cause for  deep concern.  It would make the world a more dangerous place.</p><p> Senator Rand Paul on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" says withdrawing from the treaty is  a bad idea.  .</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple  of months ago.  And they still regard this, this reduction of nuclear arms  and the disaster that would be nuclear war.  I don't want to see another  nuclear arms race with Russia or with any other country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, the U.S. claims that Russia has violated the agreement which  forbids the use of intermediate and short range rockets.  The Kremlin  adding the U.S. has not formally communicated its intentions to leave the  treaty to Russia.</p><p> And then there is this.  Papa John's founder, John Schnatter requesting the  company, amend its poison pill plan.  Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in  the company but he's prohibited from buying more stock until July of 2019  under a poison pill plan put in place by the board of directors.  Well  Schnatter was ousted, you may remember as chairman back in July after  racially-charged comments he made on a conference call leaked out to the  press.</p><p> Here's the stock.  Shares of Papa John's are down about 7 percent so far  this year.  And Maria -- as you can see on the chart, the pressure has been  on that stock as Schnatter's troubles have increased.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.</p><p> All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p> Coming up, a shakeup at CBS, the details as interim chairman, Richard  Parsons, is stepping down from the board now just a few weeks after  entering.</p><p> Then Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings -- we break down  those numbers.  As you can see, Hasbro now down 9 percent in the premarket.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Markets are higher ahead of the open this morning.  Investors are bracing  for the biggest week of third quarter earnings yet this week.</p><p>Dow Industrials up better than 90 points ahead of all of these earnings  coming out, a third of a percent.  We've got big names like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet -- all set to report.  Those are Nasdaq  companies.  And the Nasdaq is up this morning as you see all the numbers  coming out from a number of companies -- Caterpillar, McDonald's, also  market movers there.</p><p> Joining us now to talk more about that is Wells Fargo senior global equity  strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- it's good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us this morning.</p><p> What are your expectations for earnings and heading into the earnings  season, is it priced in to markets?  </p><p> SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Well, Maria --  good morning.</p><p> And I think what really people want to know, what the market wants to know  is -- we know these earnings are going to be good overall -- 20 percent,  maybe a little bit more than that.  But I think what the market really  wants to hear about is what's going to happen in 2019 because clearly  earnings growth in 2019 is going to be nowhere near what it is this year.</p><p> And then of course, you know, what's the cost?  What are these tariffs  doing to costs?  Is there wage pressure?  Anything that affects margins.   So I think that's what's really more important than the absolute results  because, you know, we know they're going to be good results.  </p><p> KELLY:  Scott -- it's pretty interesting what's happening in the market  right now and that's obviously the dislocations seem to be about one of  those costs and that's the rising cost of capital, right, going up.</p><p> But to me, it doesn't seem like the Fed is really, you know, making a  mistake here, given that inflation's up about 2.5 percent over the last 12  months but their Fed funds rate is still below that, so it's negative on  real terms.</p><p> Where do you see the Fed going next year?  Where do you see rates going?   And how is that going to impact where the market goes for the next year?   Because it seems if we're only up 4 percent so far this year, could we have  another year next year where it's only up a couple percent?  </p><p> WREN:  Well, I think, you know, as far as our fixed income group, they're  looking for a hike in December which I think the Fed is certainly directing  the market toward that.  They're also looking for three more next year, so  basically between now and the end of 2019, looking for four more hikes.</p><p> From an equity strategy point of view, we think that that -- you know,  that's really -- you're kind of at the red line and I think the market is  going to be very sensitive to any hint or conversation or enthusiasm out of  Jay Powell that, you know, hey, we might increase the pace here, which I  think would -- the market would not take very well.</p><p> Now, as far as the S&amp;P 500 right now, at least based on our analysis,  stocks are pretty close to fair value.  Our year-end target has been 2800  to 2900.  We're just a touch below there.  And I think probably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, you could see the S&amp;P 500 -- let's call  it 8 percent higher than where we are now.</p><p> So even though we think stocks are pretty fairly valued right now, still  think there's some upside here, still think the bull market is not over.   We still want to lean towards those sectors that are sensitive to a  continuation of the recovery.  We don't want our clients hiding right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott-- it's Dagen McDowell.  What do you make of the \"Wall  Street Journal\" highlights slowing sales growth and how that's a major head  wind for the markets?  Noting that third quarter sales are expected to be  up 7.3 percent from the same period last year, this is for the S&amp;P 500.   But that is the lowest rate for the S&amp;P in four quarters. </p><p> And Lindsey Bell has been on this program and voiced her concerns as well  about that.  </p><p> WREN:  You know, Dagen-- last quarter I have to say we were looking for  about -- in the second quarter we were looking for about 8 percent growth  and it came in close to 10 percent.  So our number for this third quarter  reporting season was 8 percent and we're a touch below that.</p><p> So, you know, I would consider really anything, you know, at this point in  the cycle, anything you know, 6 to 8 percent maybe 9 -- 6 to 9 percent  earnings growth or revenue growth, rather, I think that's good.  And I  think next year you'll probably see something at the lower end of that  range.</p><p> But I think that's what the market expects.  It's probably priced in and  really, you know, 7 percent or 8 percent earnings growth in the third  quarter I don't really think that's going to bother investors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you would put new money to work right here then, Scott?  </p><p> WREN:  Absolutely -- Maria.  You know, we're going to open this morning  basically sitting right on the 200 day moving average.  And we closed below  it a time or two over the last couple of weeks.  But right now I think  you're at a point where if you have money on the sidelines, you need to  start legging in.  And if we trade a little bit lower here, you should  continue to do that.</p><p> So if you have a certain amount of money, you know, at these levels, put a  third of it in and if we go a little bit lower, step in with another third  because if you think as I do that a trade war is unlikely, that we're going  to continue to see decent international growth that's based on what our  economists are looking at, we're going to see decent growth here in the  U.S., then the forward fundamentals look pretty good.  And we want our  clients stepping in here and getting exposure if they have cash on the  sidelines.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Scott -- we'll be watching.  Thanks so much.  Scott  Wren -- </p><p> WREN:  All right.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- joining us there from Wells Fargo.</p><p> Coming up, a college party turns into a nightmare -- The latest  developments after the floor collapses, injuring at least 30 people.</p><p> Then, demanding answers, what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein this upcoming Wednesday when Rosenstein testifies.  Back in a  moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 22nd.   Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> A higher start for the week for stock prices.  Take a look, markets are at  the highs right now, Dow Industrials set to open up about 100 points this  morning, that's almost one half of one percent higher.  NASDAQ is up three- quarters of a percent right now, that's the high of the morning, up 54  points on the NASDAQ.  And the S&amp;P is off third of a percent, 10 points  higher.  </p><p> This after a mixed day on Friday for the major indices at the close.  The  Dow Industrials were up 65 points, a quarter of a percent.  But the NASDAQ  was lower and the S&amp;P was also down one point on the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look, markets are seeing some gains here as  well.  FT-100 up almost one percent, 59 points higher.  CAC Quarante in  Paris up a half a percent, 23 points higher.  DAX Index in Germany up two- thirds of one percent, 77 points higher.  </p><p> Asian markets also closed higher overnight, China was the best performer,  Shanghai Composite up better than four percent.  The Chinese government  revealing tax cuts over the weekend to help boost an economy that has been  slowing.  </p><p> Well, stepping down, CBS board member Richard Parsons resigning under  health concerns.  We have details coming up this morning.  </p><p> And then, the party's over, a floor collapsed at Clemson University,  dropping party-goers and leaving at least 30 injured.  The latest on this  investigation coming up.  </p><p> Plus, basket brawl.  We're breaking down the Lakers, Rockets suspensions.   All that coming up.</p><p> Then this, free tacos, we will tell you about Taco Bell's promotion to give  away free food during tomorrow's World Series.  </p><p> All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein will appear before House  investigators this upcoming Wednesday.  The interview will be closed --  will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will be  transcribed.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte telling me  yesterday in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" what  investigators are looking for specifically.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We want to  know in particular about the new developments that we've been made aware of  about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees  and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the  president of the United States.  His boss, the chief executive officer of  our country.  </p><p> And the possibility of pulling together cabinet members to invoke the 25th  Amendment to the United States constitution which would be a mechanism to  declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice  president presumably serving in his place.  </p><p> These are very, very serious allegations.  We have all of this based upon a  newspaper report and we have third party testimony that we've heard in our  investigation.  We know he's met with President Trump.  President Trump has  been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two  at the Department of Justice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GOODLATTE:  But the Congress has oversight responsibility so we're going to  ask him about those questions along with many other things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial an analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  You only --  good morning.  You almost can't make this up really when you -- when you  think about it.  The people that Congressman Goodlatte's folks have  interviewed were not in the room when deputy attorney general Rosenstein  said this.  He doesn't seem to be much of as it be whether or not he said  it.  He says it was sarcastic.  Three people in the room say it was  sarcastic.  One person in the room, Andrew McCabe, fired from the FBI for  lying, said I interpret it seriously.  </p><p> The president either isn't worried about it or is biding his time until  after the midterm elections.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, there's more that's going to be on the -- on the  table obviously on Wednesday with Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Goodlatte is also looking to get to the bottom of what was said  to the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When they actually applied for a warrant to wiretap someone who  worked with the Trump campaign which of course is Carter Page.  And what  we've heard now from John Ratcliffe as well as Congressman Goodlatte is  that the Obama administration officials withheld information to the FISA  court in order to get that warrant.  Here's Bob Goodlatte on that issue.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOODLATTE:  There's a lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements  and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that.  He came into this matter at  the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal  of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court in  secret to approve a wiretap on an individual, who's a United States citizen  and this went on for a full year.  The last three months of which Mr.  Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.  So we have questions for  him about that and we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that, judge?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, I've been a very harsh critic for FISA for a  long time.  In my view, it is a corrupt way for the Justice Department to  use the lower FISA standard, probable cause of communicating with a foreign  person as opposed to the higher constitutional standard, you get a warrant,  probable cause of crime, in order to get the camel's nose under the tent.   In order to start listening to what someone is saying because they don't  have probable cause of crime but they do have probable cause of talking to  a foreign person.  Carter Page hasn't been charged with anything.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They served failed every conceivable thing about him for a  year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he was such -- he was such an enemy of the state, you would  have seen charges by now.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why the story outrages me.  And you know, the fact, what  John Ratcliffe told us is that when you have two pieces of information, you  have one thing from the unverified dossier to present to the FISA court,  then you have another piece of information that completely refutes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It refutes anything that Trump had anything to do with Russia  collusion, but they didn't present that to the FISA court.  They held that  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think -- I think you and I talked, maybe it was last week  about an experience I had on the bench where I learned that when  investigators came to me for an emergency search warrant which I signed.   They did not tell me what they also knew about it.  Years later, trying the  case, I said how did you get this -- how did you get this search warrant?   Did you tell the judge about this?  Not realizing that it was me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And I threw the charges out.  </p><p> So, the consequences of misbehavior by agents of the executive branch,  whether at the state level where I was or the federal level which is what  we're talking about, by not telling everything to the court can be  catastrophic for whatever they are trying to accomplish.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's Maria's issue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You are on the story like no one else, not just in T.V. but in  the media in general.  Because it falls by the wayside as people move on to  like out -- the outrage at the moment.  This is outrageous.  Because there  aren't any consequences.  Will anybody ever pay for doing this?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- who knows?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And let's put this in context of where we are, ia presidential  election year, the year is 2016.  You had one team wanting to spy on the  other team.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You had Hillary's team and the Obama administration saying you  know what, let's spy on Trump.  Let's do this.  And then, they get the  warrant to do so.  It's wrong.  It's disgusting.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two aspects here that we haven't talked about and that  is when the president of the United States said I'm going to release all  this FISA stuff, I haven't seen it but my people -- but my people have seen  it.  Who went to him and begged him not to?  British intelligence and  Israeli intelligence, which tells you their fingerprints are on it.  Which  tells you that through Jack Brennan the Obama administration was more  likely than not using foreign intelligence to commence its surveillance of  then candidate Trump and the people are watching them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they were just trying to do whatever they could to spy on  the political enemy.  It's as simple as that.  They wanted to spy on their  political enemy.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yet again, but it was also Susan  Rice didn't have -- she used surveillance, right?  She put in for the  application.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then unmasked everybody.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one -- I don't know this to be so.</p><p> KELLY:  This is getting back (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one that got this information to the  Washington Post.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And then they leaked it.  The strategy was  incredible.  </p><p> First, come up with this narrative, that Trump had anything to do with  Russia meddling.  Then, leak it to the media, let it -- get it into the  site guys.  Then, get informants to lure Trump people and say, Donald  Junior, let's go do a meeting, I've got this informant.  They're all  informants.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are some very angry Republicans about what Congressman  Goodlatte told you yesterday and who are they?  Republicans on the  committee that are not permitted to participate in this interrogation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan say Rosenstein's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- writing the rules for his own testimony because it was Rod  Rosenstein who said, you know what, we want two Republicans and two  Democrats in the room.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, when that happens and when it is recorded -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  on Wednesday.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  And then goes to the Intelligence Committee to  whitewash any classified material.  Then Republicans will leak their  version and Democrats will leak their version.  Yet again, instead of  letting the American people see that what the people we sent to Washington  to work for us are doing -- excuse me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  With the power we gave.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that, declassify.  And President needs --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They talked the -- they talked the president out of it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  The president needs to declassify these  documents so the American people can understand what went on here.  Is this  going to have a factor in the midterm?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  When and when and if it comes out, I think  it will be too late.  I don't -- I don't think this can -- this can come  out in the next two weeks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham also had a lot to say about this and he's going  to be doing a 13 city tour.  He's now, you know, looked at by the  Republican as the guy to sell their colleagues.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he became very popular when in the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  After Kavanaugh.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- in the midst of the Kavanaugh hearings, enough was enough,  I'm tired of this prosecutor from Arizona asking the questions, I'm tired  of what the Democrats are doing.  I'm going to take charge here and he did.   He lost his temper, or at least, it appeared that he did.  But he  galvanized a lot of the Republican base as well as all the Republicans on  the committee.  And pretty much chasing the Democrats.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because people felt like he was -- he was speaking for them.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anybody who was on the right felt the same way that Lindsey  Graham did.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think they're right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Watching these hearings.  So, whether -- and he just spoke from  his heart.  I mean, being a very blunt, passionate southerner.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I recognize that kind of behavior.  He's like enough is enough.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Are you a one passionate southerner?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm probably more prone to expletives than the senator.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  McKenzie, do we have the sound bite of Lindsey Graham?  I want  to tell you what Lindsey Graham said about the midterm elections and  specifically this investigation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The FBI investigation.  He's expecting to be the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham is.  Here's Lindsey Graham  with me yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, the House promises to  impeach the president and Kavanaugh.  I think the Republicans will continue  to try to hold the FBI and Department of Justice accountable for abuse of  power.  </p><p> If I'm the chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year, we hold the  Senate.  I promise you we're going to find out about the Simpson -- Fusion  GPS problem.  I promise you, we're going to get to the bottom of how they  used a dossier, prepared by foreign agents, paid for by the Democratic  Party to get a warrant against an American citizen.  We're not going to  turn our back on this.</p><p> If I'm chairman, we're going to get to the bottom of this.  And the only  way for me to be chairman is for us to hold the Senate.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if the Republicans hold the senate, as seems likely, if  the Democrats take the House which this morning seems likely, the two  chairs of the Judiciary Committee couldn't be more opposite.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerry Nadler.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And all the stuff that Congressman Goodlatte wants to come  out, the Democrats take the House, we'll never see it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It goes away.  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Another consequence of this midterm election.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Judge, great to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know I was kidding, McD.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know you were -- of course you were -- not really, actually.   Expletive, expletive, expletive.  You're lucky I didn't say -- you know  what, if I was really mad, I'd say --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I want to hear you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  coming up, major changes at CBS to tell you about, the details  as interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning from the company's board,  that's next.</p><p> And then a brawl on the basketball court, why three players and the lead  singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were ejected.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Get this, a college party turned into a  nightmare.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl, what a story.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  These poor kids, Maria.  About  30 people sent to the hospital after a floor suddenly gave way beneath them  during a party near the campus of Clemson University.  This happened in  South Carolina.  The whole thing captured on a party-goers iPhone.  </p><p> Yes, well, a witness says people were jumping to a popular song when the  floor just caved in.  Clemson said the police said none of the injuries are  luckily, life-threatening.  </p><p> Well, the interim chairman of CBS resigned after a month on the job due to  health issues.  Richard Parsons is stepping down after his doctors told him  to reduce his workload so he can deal with complications from multiple  myeloma.  Strauss Zelnick, another new board member is going to take over  for Parsons.  Shares of CBS are down three percent so far this year.  </p><p> Then there is this, guys, Senator Elizabeth Warren defending her decision  to take a DNA test to prove she is indeed part Native American.  So, at a  debate yesterday for her Senate seat, Warren said that she did it to,  quote:  Rebuild trust in the government through transparency.  </p><p> In March, Warren had said that no DNA test was needed to prove her claim  but she said she ultimately took the test which showed a relative six to 10  generations ago was indeed Native American.  And we played the ad for our  viewers last week, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what was -- what was that, one, 1000.  </p><p> CASONE:  Six to 10 generations.  Six grandparents ago.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  At the -- at the -- at the least, she is one, 1,024th native  American, which would put here at a lower percentage than the average  European-American in terms of the percentage of their background that is  Native American.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why are we still talking about this?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because she can't shut up about it.</p><p> KELLY:  Because Democrats --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She thinks the more she talks about it, she's somehow going to  be right.  Number one, she caved in to President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, totally.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Number one.  Number two, Harvard law school was presenting her  as their first woman of color.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, that's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In print.  Harvard law spokesman -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, she did gain them -- she gained from lying.  </p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  This is --  this is why it mattered.  As she was technically their minority person on  their faculty.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HIGGINS:  And so she deliberately traded on this part of status of -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HIGGINS:  You know, which is not knowing that it was in any way true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Are you a Taco Bell fan?  We will tell you how you  can score a free taco during the World Series, next.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are seven weeks into the NFL season.  The standings are  beginning to take shape.  Jared Max said the Chiefs are on top in the AFC.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria, the AFC really  looks like a two-team race between the Chiefs and the Patriots.  </p><p> One week after New England handed Kansas City its first loss, on the last  second field goal, Kansas City barbecued the Bengals, 45-10.   PatrickMahomes, four more touchdown passes, the Chiefs goes to 6-1, 45-10.  </p><p> Because of a snap penalty against Dallas, the Cowboy's 47-yard potential  game tying field goal became a 52-yarder.  Would have been good for 47, but  the Redskins win.  First place Redskins beat the Cowboys 20-17.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Losers, the Cowboys.  Losers.  Continue, Jared.  </p><p> MAX:  The Carolina Panthers -- the Carolina Panthers came back from 17 down  to beat the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles by three.  Panthers' Eric  Reid earlier had to be restrained before the opening coin toss.  Reid went  after the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and other players.  </p><p> Now, last year Jenkins co-founded the NFL players coalition to work with  the league on social justice issues.  Now, Jenkins no longer kneels for the  anthem.  Reid does.  And he thinks Jenkins is a sellout.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ERIC REID, SAFETY, PANTHERS:  I believe Malcolm capitalized on the  situation.  He co-opted the movement that was started by Collin to get his  organization funding.  It's cowardly.  He sold us out.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Sold them out, wow.  </p><p> And football, we have feistiness and also in the NBA.  After Saturday's  Lakers, Rockets game, became fight night at L.A. at the NBA, suspends three  players total of nine games without pay.  Chris Paul of the Rockets, two  games suspended.  He poked Rajon Rondo in the eye.  Rondo started to punch  Paul.  He got three games, one more than Paul, because he threw the first  punch and appears to have spit right at Chris Paul.  Now, this instigated  the fight.  Rondo throws a several punches and the Lakers Brandon Ingram  gets four games.  Wow.  </p><p> World Series begins tomorrow night on Fox at Fenway Park.  The Red Sox  favored to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Chris Sale will be Boston's game  one starter, likely Clayton Kershaw for L.A.  </p><p> World Series provisionally Taco Bell will give out free Doritos tacos --  free Doritos Locos Tacos, got to go crazy, for four hours on November 1st,  all we have to see is a base get stolen in the World Series and the free  Doritos Locos Tacos is yours.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, bring on the Locos Tacos.  </p><p> MAX:  Two quiero, Taco Bell.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.  What a fight there with the Lakers.  That  was --- that was not good.  Jared, thank you.  Catch Jared sports reports  on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM 115.  </p><p> Still ahead, the battle at the border.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p> CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.   Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government  revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.  </p><p> Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi  Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action  against the kingdom.  This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad  bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their  condolences.  </p><p> Plus, caravan crisis.  The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United  States border is growing.  It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on  that caravan.</p><p> On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol  Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House  investigators.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p> We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p> HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p> So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p> KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p> KELLY:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p> HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p> KELLY:  Correct.</p><p> HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p> He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p> The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p> BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p> And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p> YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p> And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p> And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p> And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p> YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p> We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p> YORK:  Correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p> The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p> ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p> YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p> We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p> Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p> HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p> HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p> YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p> The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p> And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p> The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p> President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p> However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p> HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p> So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p> We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p> The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p> Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p> And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p> OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p> Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p> European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p> The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p> All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p> Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p> FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p> FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p> FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p> FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p> FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p> FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p> FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p> FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p> FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p> FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p> FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p> FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p> FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p> FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p> FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p> News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.   Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.  I have alerted  Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency.  Must change  laws!\"  That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed  to the border of the U.S.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  When we come back, we're watching oil.  Brent  rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00  and change, what's driving this market.  Then, 15 days until midterm  elections.  The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart  Varney on that.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The economy under President Trump, the  President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections  according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p> I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p> But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p> I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p> SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p> Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p> SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p> SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p> VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning  to you.  Thank you so much.  Happy Monday.  We'll see you in a little bit,  girls.  Thank you.  It is Monday, October 27th -- October 22nd.  Good  morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher.  Here are your top stories.  6:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting for gains, futures indicating the markets this morning will open  fractionally better on the session.  Dow Industrials up 25, NASDAQ up 31  right now, half a percent higher.</p><p>This after a mixed story on Wall Street on Friday.  The market snapped a  two-day losing streak, posting a slight gain on the session with the Dow  Industrials up 65 points, quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  weaker on Friday at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are edging higher, take a look.  FT-100 up  a half percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of a percent, 40 points higher. </p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board at the close.  And as you see,  the Shanghai Composite, the best performer out of China, up better than  four percent on the session.</p><p>Stocks in china soaring.  The government revealing tax changes to help  support the slowing economy.  And with that, a multi-move across the board,  and the averages, best in four years.</p><p>Investors bracing for the busiest week of earnings season so far.  Ten Dow  Components due to report their third quarter earnings, plus technology  giants Amazon and Alphabet on deck this week.</p><p>On Friday, we get the first look at third quarter GDP.  That could be a  market mover.  We'll break it all down and we got all the preview on  earnings as well.</p><p>Another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says that  he wants to get something done before November eight days from now, what  that means ahead of the midterm elections this morning.</p><p>And upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is headed to  Saudi Arabia today, amid pressure to take action against the Kingdom after  it admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham telling me on Sunday Morning Futures he felt used by  the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he's open to keeping the arms  seal -- sales deal on track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it impossible to believe  that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So, go after him and his inner  circle, save they alliance.</p><p>I don't mind military sales, but I cannot do business with the current  leadership.  MBS, he's done to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus, caravan crisis, thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into Mexico  with their sights on the U.S.A.  We're going to take you live to the border  to get an update on that caravan this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and Independent Women's Voice CEO,  Heather Higgins, is here this morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Thank you </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS:  It's going to be a  hectic week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hectic week because of earnings, hectic week because of?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  GDP out on Friday.  We find out how fast this country was  growing in the third quarter and if we need more tax cuts, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  President said that on the campaigns trial on  Saturday, but it's also a huge week for earnings.  We've got technology in  the spotlight, Amazon and Alphabet may very well move markets.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, big time.  Especially because I'm looking forward to Verizon  tomorrow because they're going to talk about their 5G rollout.  They did it  in four different cities.  So, that's the way with the future.  </p><p>We'll see how much capital they need to put into that.  That's part of the  Infrastructure Bill.  Remember the President keeps talking about  infrastructure?  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, 5G is part of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The GDP number on Friday, Dagen, I guess the, you know, Atlanta  Fed was all the way up at, what, four -- better than 4.5 percent, 4.8  percent or so?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we now on that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the Wall Street Journal, in its estimate, so it was 4.2  percent in the second quarter, but the third quarter is expected to come in  at 3.4 percent in the preliminary reading.  A wide -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still a good number.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A widening trade gap could be a drag on third quarter GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Based on the Journal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  So good backdrop, Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It is now.  And they're -- the administration's really happy with  anything over three percent just because we --- they keep saying --  everybody said even three percent was impossible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  We're so happy to have anything over three percent.  That is  great.  And so -- but they're looking at these four percent plus numbers  and they're thrilled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you get the biggest week of third quarter earnings so far.   That's going to also show you some real growth.  That means like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent company, Alphabet, all setting to report along  with 10 Dow Components.</p><p>On the economic side, the highlight of the week, of course, is that GDP  report.  And in terms of what we're going to see in terms of market  expectations.  Pretty much baked in a better than three percent number?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think it is.  One of the things that has weighed on  economists has been the tariffs, and so that's why the look-through into  tech earnings this week is, what have the implications been.  </p><p>Especially when you think about Apple, they come out next week.  They  haven't updated the guidance, but they said the tariffs are a tax on  consumers.  So, how is that going to impact their phone sales, especially  because they came out with new releases?  </p><p>I think it's interesting to note that technology stocks are only valued  seven percent higher than the general market.  The market's trading about  15.9 times earnings, tech's around 16.6, but they have twice the profit  margins.</p><p>So, let's see what the guidance is coming forward.  So you saw Goldman  Sachs even came out earlier this week.  I mean, last week.</p><p>They were talking about how tech isn't overvalued and that this the selloff  has been unwarranted, but it's important to note that investors have been  rotating into safer names.</p><p>They don't think we're going to get 10, 20, 30 percent returns going  forward.  They went into consumer staples stocks.  Consumer staples stocks  are up 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Technology stocks are down 3.5 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to also watch out for, the Wall Street Journal writes  about this in today's paper.  Slowing sales growth.</p><p>So instead of earnings, because, again, if sales growth slows -- and we  have had, according to the Journal, 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies  have reported so far.  Based on our estimates, it's actually 38 percent,  miss-sales forecasts.</p><p>If sustained, that quarterly sales miss-ratio would mark the highest so far  this year.  So again, if you're coming up short on sales for whatever  reason, whether it's higher prices that you -- you're not -- that you're  trying to pass on and people aren't buying it, whatever the reason, that  doesn't bode well for earnings growth into next year.  </p><p>And sales are only growing, are expected to grow 7.3 percent, which is  slightly lower than expectations going into this quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the guidance is going to be reflecting what the  expectations are on the trade situation, right?  On tariffs.</p><p>Because if we start -- this is when we're going to know.  I mean, companies  should probably guide us toward us, \"All right, we're going to see lower  sales than expected because of the tariffs.\"</p><p>I don't know that's the case, but I would imagine this is the quarter when  we find out if, in fact, it is going to weigh on earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the most important thing that the market's going to  focus is operating margins.  They think margins are going to come down and  be compressed because several factors.  Some of them are the rising input  costs, now we're seeing inflation's going up.  </p><p>We're also seeing labor costs are going up, costs of goods are going up.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So the problem is this, how are they going to be able to maintain  that, if they're not able to get more productivity out of their workers?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  If you can pass on these higher costs, which like with  Unilever, some of the big consumer products companies, then that's good  news. The -- </p><p>I mean not ultimately to the customer, but it's good news for the companies  again, but it's -- again, the higher input costs, you can't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  For whatever reason, it's not just tariffs.  Watch a lot of  companies potentially, if they're coming up short, start to blame tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're going to have to kind of comb through the -- try and  separate the fact from the fiction.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It'll be -- </p><p>KELLY:  Also the storm, they'll see that in -- about the storms, right?  So  we -- they'll think next quarter's going to be weak because of the storms,  whatever's happening.</p><p>We've seen -- Home Depot should be strong, but they actually got a  downgrade last week because they think the consumer's not going to be as  strong in upgrading their homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, whatever weakness we see, the President's trying to  offset it now with talk of more tax cuts ahead of the election. </p><p>He spoke to reporters just this weekend about a package that they're  working on right now.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be sometime, just prior I would say to November.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, Election Day is 15 days away at this point, November  1st.  Ten days away.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He didn't say which November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, of course, you know, Congress is out of session until  after the November Elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe he comes out with an announcement before midterm  elections, but we're not going to see a vote, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  And quite frankly, the deficit is becoming -- it's starting  to become an issue for politicians and for the American people.</p><p>President Trump said \"I'm ordering all my cabinet secretaries to cut their  spending by 5 percent.  But discretionary spending is what one-third --  roughly one-third of the entire budget every year.  And if you cut out  defense, it's a cut -- I think it represents less than one percent of  overall spending.</p><p>So again, I don't -- he -- it would take -- it's a long road to plow in  terms of pushing through a tax cut at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we know they want to make the individual cut permanent and  we know that that's going to be on their agenda should they have the  opportunity, even after the midterm elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe it --I mean he said Kevin Brady is working on it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  House, Ways and Means.  So maybe it's an announcement from  House, Ways and Means before the midterms.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It could be.  They won't get anything passed.  But it's been  pretty clear that even though they passed the first tax cut, that even  though they were constrained by certain prior agreements to have the  individual cuts be temporary, the goal was always to make those be  permanent.</p><p>You are now seeing a recovery which, for the first time in a very long  time, is being led by blue-collar job growth, blue-collar wages, small  business confidence, rather than leading from the top.</p><p>It's sort of from the bottom.  And those people are going to be going into  the midterms looking at this fantastically booming economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Trump's approval ratings are now higher than Obama's were going  into his first midterms.  And his disapproval ratings have actually come  down, layering on a promised middle-class tax cuts can't hurt.</p><p>And -- because serious way, if you want to take on the deficit, and this  may be the one President who can cut through the swamp and actually get  this done, because the creatures on both sides of the aisle like the  current services baseline, economic gains that would never, ever be allowed  in the private sector in terms of automatic budget increases and claiming.  </p><p>Because, you know, they get to claim to these two different constituents  coming into their office and for the exact same thing, they get to claim  that they were either cutting it or increasing it because of the semantics  involved with the built-in increases.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  If you're serious about taking on the deficit, then have you to  be serious on taking on the financial accounting games that are played in  Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's Saudi Arabia on deck as well.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin now defending his decision to go to Saudi.  He's meeting  with Saudi officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p>He says the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at this critical moment.   He's not going to that conference, but this trip comes after Saudi Arabia  said that Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was in fact killed  in a fist fight inside the Istanbul Consulate.</p><p>The Kingdom is forcefully denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  Lawmakers, though, are showing  skepticism on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Did the Crown Prince know anything  about it?  If there were people closely tied to him involved in this  operation?</p><p>ADEL BIN AHMED AL-JUBEIR, DIPLOMAT, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:   There weren't people closely tied to him who were involved in this  operation.  This was an operation that was a rogue operation. </p><p>This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities  and responsibilities they had.</p><p>GRAHAM:  it's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to  kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it.  That would  be brazen abuse of authority.</p><p>He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in  Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will quote the Wall Street Journal editorial today on this  very issue.  Saudi Arabia needs to step up.  We still don't know -- they  haven't produced Khashoggi's body, provided more details of precisely how  or when he decide.</p><p>The story doesn't add up.  Of the 18 people arrested, five others sacked,  several a part of Mohammed bin Salman the inner circle.  It's unlikely they  would have acted alone without at least, you know, feeling a tacit assent  from the Crown Prince.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial goes on to write, \"The U.S. goal should  be to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear that  murdering journalists is unacceptable and that Mohammed bin Salman's  erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral  relationship.\"</p><p>We can't dictate what King Salman will do about who should run Saudi  Arabia, but you can -- but Mohammed bin Salman also can't be allowed to  conclude that America thinks this is no big deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they've got to do something.  The U.S. has to do  something to push back in the face of this heinous situation.</p><p>Question is, does Mohammed bin Salman survive?  He's got two other sons.   There are a lot of people who want this guy out at this point.  Lindsey  Graham included.</p><p>So big question here, you know, I mean, the arms sales is going -- it's  going to go through.  The relationship is going to go through because  there's one big black eye here that we're faced with and that is Iran, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the muddled response from this administration and the uneven  response that we've seen since this all began, we need to be on very firm  footing about the message, like Lindsey Graham said that we send to King  Salman about who we -- who should run the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  I want to disagree.  I think that the administration has been  taking a difficult situation.  These are people that behaved really badly,  like so many of the people we've had to deal with.  And they've got this  challenge of how do you negotiate making them pay for it, making them fess  up to it, but not having them lose so much for -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But comparing it to Brett Kavanaugh was a misstep.  I'm sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, it's shifting gears for FiatChrysler.  Details on the  automaker's roughly $7 billion car parts deal.  That's next.  </p><p>And then a spooky box office debut, we've got it here on Halloween.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Battle at the border for sure, a migrant caravan  moving toward the United States.  It has grown now to roughly 5,000 people.   Griff Jenkins is live in McAllen, Texas this morning with details there,  right in the middle of it.  Griff.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  When the  caravan gets to this border, if they do indeed come here, they're going to  find an overwhelmed border already with illegal crossing.  </p><p>And the Rio Grande Valley Sector where I'm standing McAllen is the busiest  sector of the entire U.S. border, and it had more than 12,700 illegal  crossing arrests in just the last three weeks.  </p><p>Over the weekend, over 800 pounds of marijuana confiscated, and it is part  of the problem here they're seeing is also family units, women and children  coming, much like the caravan of migrants from Central American countries.</p><p>We spent time yesterday with the Sector Chief, a guy named Manuel Padilla,  talking about the caravan that's coming and what he says is a need for more  infrastructure.  Take a listen.</p><p>MANUEL PADILLA, CHIEF, RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR:  If we had this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure throughout my border,  we would truly transform this area.  It's a win-win situation for  everybody.</p><p>This area right here, we do not see MS-13, we do not see criminal aliens  coming into this area, because of the capability that we have through this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure.</p><p>JENKINS:  But he's only got well and about 55 of the nearly 300 parts of  this sector and it's a busy one.  The President, Maria, will be in Houston  today and Houston is in this RGV area.  I'm sure this topic will certainly  come up.  Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins is live  McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>What a scene.  We are going to be watching that as that caravan moves  closer to where Griff is actually standing.</p><p>Switching gears, a deadly train derailment in Taiwan.  Cheryl Casone with  that right now in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, good morning.</p><p>An express train went off the tracks, killing at least 18 people.  This  happened in Eastern Taiwan.  More than 150 others were injured in this  disaster.  Witnesses say all eight of the train's carriages went off the  rails as it was traveling to the eastern city of Taitung.</p><p>This comes a year after another express train on the same line derailed.   The cause of yesterday's accident, under investigation.</p><p>Well, Fiat Chrysler is unloading its car parts business.  The company is  selling the unit to Japan's Calsonic Kansei for just over $7 billion.   Calsonic is owned by the U.S. private-equity firm, KKR.  The deal is going  to make the newly-combined company one of the world's biggest auto parts  suppliers.</p><p>The FiatChrysler- - excuse me -- in the premarket up 4.6 percent, about.</p><p>And then finally, there is this.  The horror movie, \"Halloween,\" making a  killing at the box office this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this  night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been preparing for this for a long time. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is not safe to be on the streets tonight.  Go  home!  Get out of here!  Get inside!  Michael?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The film raking in $77.5 million, a record opening for the  franchise.  It also is the second-best October opening weekend of all time. </p><p>Holding on to second place, in its third weekend, \"A Star Is Born,\" $19.3  million.  </p><p>Rounding out top five, last week's big winner was \"Venom,\" followed by \"  Goosebumps 2:  Haunted Halloween,\" and, Maria, \"First Man.\"  </p><p>Jamie Curtis, she's still got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she does.  Good movies this weekend.  Thanks, Cheryl. </p><p>Coming up, a new way to calculate your FICO score, we will tell you why  your cash may help.  That's next.</p><p>And then Facebook goes shopping.  The technology giant's reported plan to  purchase a cybersecurity company, all right here after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Increasing access to credit, Fair Isaac, the  company behind the FICO score, is rolling out a major change, UltraFICO  Score will go beyond payment history.</p><p>According to the Journal this morning, it will factor in bank account  activity, how consumers manage their cash and checking, savings and money  market accounts.  It launches next year. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Mark Hamrick.  He's  Bankrate.com's Senior Economic Analyst.  </p><p>And Mark, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining  us.  </p><p>MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think this is about younger people, this new FICO  change.  Tell us about it.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Primarily, and we think about the fact that there's a large  portion of the U.S. population which really isn't doing business with  traditional financial service companies.  Millennial have been smart.   They're saving more money.</p><p>Our recent Bankrate survey found that about two-thirds of the American  public was essentially limiting its spending and millennials are doing the  best job of saving more money so that money is sitting in accounts not  necessarily being spent.</p><p>At Bankrate, we say that the two biggest problems that have been identified  by Americans is their failure to save for retirement and for emergencies.   So, financial companies want to create new customers and help connect them  to borrowing products.  It's a logical step for them.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there a way to opt out of this?  It's -- the last thing I want  with the Equifax hacking and everything going on about security, the last  thing I want is somebody to pull up my UltraFICO to see how much money --  cash I have in a bank account, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how you're managing all your money, and all your accounts.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Savings, checking.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes.  Well, to the question, I think you're right on.  I think  Americans are tired of having their personal information essentially taken  from them.  </p><p>And I think this is going to be something to watch in terms of regulation  in the coming years, whether it's the information that Facebook and Google  possess about us or our credit rating scores, because I think we have a  sense that we have no control over this information.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the -- with the -- this new FICO score, is this a way  to essentially offer people even more credit, if you will, that this is at  a time when people are increasingly stretched, that you've seen auto  lending particularly on the fringes of people with very low subprime auto  lending really being pulled back on?  </p><p>Is this a way to basically shine up people's credit scores and make them  more palatable to the lender?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  That's a very good question.  I think that is essentially the  tension that could be created by this.  In other words, giving loans to  people who are not well qualified. </p><p>But that, I don't think, is the intention.  Most financial service firms  are not looking to create new losses.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell has said that he thinks that household balance sheets are  in good shape.  He's more concerned about the commercial side.</p><p>So, I think this is more about trying to identify good data about consumers  and potential borrowers and connecting them to products that they might  find useful.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Meanwhile, you've got a new survey on how Americans are spending,  and if they're cutting back on spending, right?  Let's talk about that.  </p><p>Sixty-six percent say that they're living -- they're limiting spending,  thirty-six percent say that they are doing it to save money.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes, and I think this is a good thing.  As I said, you know, I  don't think there are many Americans that go essentially into their last  days saying, \"You know what, I saved too much money.\"  Ii think more  Americans regret that they didn't do a better job of saving for retirement  or emergencies.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And I think that 36 percent was only of the 66 percent that were  saving.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So it was only 24 percent overall that we're saving for longer  term.</p><p>The other thing that was interesting in the study was, there has long been  a contention that the big difference between how well you do in life is how  long your time horizon is.</p><p>And when you looked at the study, the people who were making over $50,000  clearly had a longer time horizon that they were saving for, whereas the  people who were under that were just sort of saving for the short-term  needs and they weren't thinking beyond that.</p><p>How, if we're going to move away from the Keynesian mentality, that the  more debt you have and the more spending you have, the better off we all  are, to one where people are more prudent and thinking about their savings,  how is borrowing going to help that happen?</p><p>HAMRICK:  I think essentially, it's two different questions.  I think the  first question is, as long as you have a healthy economy, most Americans  will be mindful of trying to achieve proper financial goals.</p><p>I do think in our society, we have a significant problem with lack of  financial literacy and that's an education issue, which i don't hear a lot  of people talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's too bad.  It really just starts at home.  But we're  certainly interested in that.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you this morning.  Mark Hamrick joining us from  Bankrate.com.  </p><p>Take a short break.  When we come back, Jamie Dimon's big bet, why J.P.  Morgan is building a campus in Silicon Valley.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then fixing traffic gridlock, details on Elon Musk's high-speed transit  tunnel.  It's nearly finished.  Will it offer free rides to the public?  We  will tell you about that.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, October  22nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  The major  indices on Wall Street looking to open higher this morning ahead of a big  week for earnings.  This right here is the high of the morning, up 73  points on the Dow Industrials, a quarter of a percent.  The NASDAQ is up  two-thirds of a percent, that's 42 points higher.  This after a mixed close  on Friday, all ahead of a big week in earnings.  This is one of the busiest  weeks we're going to see.  </p><p>Dow Industrials, on Friday, up 65 points at the close, a quarter of a  percent higher.  The S&amp;P500 was flat, down one point; and the NASDAQ was  lower by half a percent, 36 points lower on NASDAQ on Friday.  In Europe  this morning, take a look at indices, higher across the board.  FT-100 up  two-thirds of one percent; CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent;  and the DAX Index in Germany, up two-thirds of one percent right now.   Asian markets closed higher overnight.  The Shanghai Composite was up  strong, up four percent.  China's government revealing tax cuts over the  weekend to help boost that economy which has shown slowdown.  </p><p>Facebook is eyeing, shoring up its security.  The company reportedly  looking to make an acquisition in cyber sector.  Plus, the company faces  request a from Japan to beef up security.  Building the future.  Details on  JPMorgan Chase's newest investment in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you  what's behind that move.  And then a rare -- a rare reality.  Elon Musk  tweeting out date for his hyperloop transport.  When you can expect to take  a ride on a high-speed rail, from Elon Musk?  And forget getting candies in  your trick or treat bags.  We've got the very list of the U.S. cities  spending the most on Halloween this year -- it might surprise you.  </p><p>First though, our top story this half an hour.  Countdown to midterm  elections now 15 days away.  President Trump and former President Obama  squaring off in dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  President Trump will hit the campaign trail  in Houston in support of Ted Cruz, while former President Obama will  touchdown in Las Vegas and campaign there.  Enthusiasm for President Trump  is high, lines of supporters are already covering entire blocks as nearly  100,000 people wait to enter venue that can hold 18,000.  18,000 is what  the capacity is.  </p><p>Yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham to get his take on the most important issues on the ballot  this November.  President Trump has hand-picked Senator Graham to go out  and campaign for colleagues.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM:  I think people are going to be voting on the mob rule of the  Democratic Party.  If you like Democrats around the House, you know exactly  what you're going to get: They're going to try and impeach the president,  impeach Kavanaugh; they don't care about your wallet, they just want to get  in your wallet.  </p><p>If you keep Republicans in charge, we're going to keep the economy moving  forward, we're going to secure our border, we're going to deal with our  enemies throughout the world, we're going to rebuild our military.  And  when it comes to standing up to the world, you need a strong leader like  President Trump, and the Democratic Party has showed us what they would do  with power, not much for you.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the president has asked Lindsey Graham to go on the road;  he's going to talk -- he's going to be in 13 cities in just a couple of  days.  Joining us right now is Republican Strategist Kimberly Klacik.   Kimberly, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.   Your reaction to Senator Graham and what you might expect from him in the  next couple of days as he travels to 13 cities to campaign?  </p><p>KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I see this new Lindsey Graham that  we've been seeing, I expect good things.  I mean, he's absolutely right.   You know exactly what you're going to get if the Democrats take over the  House.  They have been intolerant lately.  The mob -- the mob name actually  fits them properly.  And I think for a lot of people, we don't really  understand whether or not there is a blue wave coming.  I'm not convinced.   In 2016, everyone said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, we saw that  Trump won and that's basically because people were afraid to show support  for Trump, so I don't think we really know what's going to happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's new line lately in his campaigns have been  \"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.\"  We saw that mob- thinking again this weekend when Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao  were harassed while they were at dinner, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and there was a panel in MSNBC that essentially justifies  this kind of behavior base on the fact that Merrick Garland didn't get a  vote in front of the Senate under Mitch McConnell.  That was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's justified.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, that that's justified.  And they're -- the message from  the Democrats is \"we are coming for you.\"  If you support Trump, we're  going to show up at your place of work, where you eat, where you live.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you deny that's not the mob?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is the mob.  I think that that's a great slogan.  He's --  President Trump is also really focused on immigration, attention to the  border wall, and in fact, I know that Joe Donnelly who is a Democrat  running for election in Indiana has actually running ads promoting his  support of President Trump on immigration -- border wall.  And radical left  talking about abolishing ICE.  So, smart Democrats like Donnelly in  Indiana, they know that this is an important issue to Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because -- and then you've got Kevin McCathy bringing the  bill to the floor right after midterms, Kimberly, to build the wall,  enforce the law -- act, that's what it is.  And voter interest in this  election has surged today record highs in both parties.  A new Wall Street  Journal/NBC News poll finds that nearly two-thirds of registered voters say  they are very interested in this year's midterms, that's the highest ever  recorded by the survey.  President Trump's job approval rating, as we just  heard, got a boost, the poll finds that approval rating now at 47 percent.   This is the highest of his time in office, Kimberly, going into these  midterm elections, what are your thoughts?  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, and it's well deserved.  You see, President Trump -- I don't  think the Democrats have identified that he's done anything wrong.  You  have to remember, usually, Democrats run on making promises, usually  promises they can't keep.  And so, right now, you have a bunch of problems  that Trump is solving on his own.  People were talking about immigration  and they should, because this is really a threat on our national security.   It's not about not wanting people to come in and live for the American  dream.  So, yes, they are absolutely right about this, and I think that is  why there's overwhelming support right now for President Trump, because  there's a lot of people on his side here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you know, Heather, when you look at these pictures of  this caravan making its way to the United States, it is just perfect timing  going into the midterm elections because it's a reminder that the president  is trying to secure the borders and have legal immigration.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  The caravan is the single largest one picture argument for a wall  that Trump could have ever asked for.  And particularly, when you see the  soldiers in Guatemala or the police there trying to stop it and getting  overrun on the fences, getting overrun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HIGGINS:  What's interesting about the poll that just came out, I've been  saying from the beginning that there was not going to be a blue wave and  that the Republicans, actually, I will predict will keep the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  And the poll has been interesting in that is now down to a nine- point Democrat advantage in the generic, but if you look in the  battleground states, it is completely even now.  I think, I think it is not  going to be the blue wave, I think it's going to be a major red wall, and  there's going to be more pick-ups in the Senate as well as holding of the  House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know I'm talking out both sides in my mouth, one problem,  though, in President Trump making immigration a front and center issue,  talking about the wall is the fact that the Republicans in control of the  Senate and the House didn't fully fund his wall, and they didn't basically  starve the sanctuary cities of money.  This is another can that's been  kicked down the road after midterms, so in some way, he's highlighting what  the Republicans haven't gotten done, but they haven't fulfilled agenda on  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Exactly.  This has been the biggest problem that Republicans have  had to overcome is their failure to follow through on things that they  promised to do, whether it was health care or taking on sanctuary cities or  border wall funding, I think part of the reason that you saw the tremendous  lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters until the Kavanaugh hearings was  that there was this disjunction, what had been promised versus what had  been delivered in the general sense of why would I bother voting for you?   Kavanaugh made it very clear why you would bother voting for them because  the alternative was much worse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, now, Donald Trump just gave them another reason and that's  tax cut 2.0.  So, if you think about it, no better way to mobilize people  to vote than tell them you're going to do tax cut 2.0 a couple of weeks  before election.  So, I think that timing was perfect and he's now throwing  the Democrats in a (INAUDIBLE), because he's going to make them start  talking about taxes and has done very well for Republicans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: And let not forget -- let's not forget, Kimberly, not one  Democrat voted for that tax cut plan.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, that's true.  So, how much are they really for the American  people?  I think that right now this is the perfect storm, like you said  the caravan coming is the perfect storm.  We have to remember, do we really  want people in our country, as the first thing they do when they get here  is break our laws?  We are a nation of laws and we deserve to know who our  neighbors are, and we should be vetting legal immigrants.  I think,  honestly, I don't see the blue wave either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kimberly, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kimberly Klacik joining us there.  Coming up, doubling down on  data protection, details on Facebook's reported plans to purchase a  cybersecurity company, that's next.  And then getting into the Halloween  spirit, we will tell you the city spending the most money on Halloween  ahead of October 31.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New pressure this morning on Facebook over data  protection, Cheryl Casone on it in headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, the Japanese government has ordered Facebook to better  protect user data.  Japan's asking the company to fully communicate  security issues to its users and inform regulators of any change in  security measures.  This, of course, comes after Facebook said earlier this  month, hackers stole information of about 30 million people.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly planning to go buy a major cybersecurity  firm.  Reports say Facebook has approached several companies for a  potential acquisition.  Taking a look at shares of the company down 13  percent so far this year, there's Facebook.  </p><p>Well, JPMorgan Chase is planning to build a new campus that's going to  focus on Fintech or Financial Technology.  This campus is going to be out  in Silicon Valley.  More than 1,000 employees are going to work at the  campus when it opens up in Palo Alto in 2020.  A project part of an effort  by JPMorgan to keep up with changes in digital payments which is big  business.  Most of the employers are going to work for JPMorgan Chase's  merchant services division.  Shares of JPMorgan are up nearly one percent  so far this year.  </p><p>And Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry in the United States.   So, this year, Americans are expected to spend $9 billion on candy,  costumes, decorations.  That works out to an average 86 bucks per person.   And 24/7 Wall Street created an index to see which cities actually spend  the most on Halloween.  And this year, the top of the list: Number one,  Phoenix; right behind it, L.A., Honolulu, Burbank, and Paradise, Nevada.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money on candy and Halloween stuff.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's a lot of yummy candy, that's all I can say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, are we going to have some Halloween candy onset at some  point?  </p><p>CASONE:  I'm working on it.  You know I'm on that.  You read my mind. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I figured there were some story around that.  That can get some  chocolate up here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whole Foods sells vegan candy corn.  I found that yesterday.   Quite delicious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one.  Good info.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why Phoenix is number one the list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>KELLY:  Because of my sister, she goes by Pauline Halloween, and she makes  it the whole month and she spends -- I mean, this is her Super Bowl.  This  is, like, what she lives for every year.  So, I can -- that explains.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was surprised its Phoenix.  I don't know why.  </p><p>KELLY:  I'm not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of decorations here in New York are pretty funny.  People  get into it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  My kids are now, all three, simultaneously in college, but it  wasn't too long ago where the house was decorated stem to stern and we put  in a haunted house and all the rest of it.  And now, all of that stuff  stays in the basement because we're not at trick or treat age.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A very young French girl in my building told me that she's going  as one of the pink ladies, and she said, do you know who the pink ladies  are?  And I went, my dear, I saw Greece when it was released, at drive-in  movie theater.  And she went, what's a driving --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>KELLY:  That's amazing.</p><p>HIGGINS:  That is funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, going  underground.  Elon Musk's infrastructure firm, the Boring Company gearing  up to unveil its first high-speed transit tunnel.  Details on the launch  right after this.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk out with new details about his high- speed hyperloop transport.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.   Lauren, good morning. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good morning, we have a date and we have a place.  So, this is  what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend: \"First tunnel almost done.\"  And  then he responded to a follower on Twitter, when: Well, \"opens December  10th.\"  His Boring Company on December 11th, will then take the public on  free rides of a tunnel track.  </p><p>Check this out, which will run in Hawthorne, California from SpaceX --  another one of Musk's company -- it's North 200th Street, then west from  there for about two miles.  It uses a loop system, which transports a car  or a vehicle, as you can see on platform, which they called the skate and  it basically skates you 150 miles an hour to your destination, no traffic,  no speeding ticket.  </p><p>When Musk first announced the boring company back in 2016 because he was  bored sitting in traffic, most people thought he was nuts.  But once again,  the visionary CEO making due on pie in the sky idea and inviting the public  to try it out for free and that maybe his way of faring well in the court  of public opinion because at least two of his tunnels face lawsuits.  </p><p>In California, they're worried about environment and what tunneling in  seismic-prone areas could do to residents' homes.  Now, Musk is also  working on a tunnel from Dodger's stadium to a nearby train station -- but  that one will not be opened for the World Series.  I know a lot of people  would appreciate that as we gear up for the big games tomorrow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  I think it's going to be great.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  An electric subterranean train station, essentially.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but the real question is, can my face be pulled back?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, he promised that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, I'm dead serious.  His follower said, is this is going to  be like a really cool disco-like experience?  And he said, yes, so there's  going to be something cool happening in those tunnels -- it's kind of scary  if you ask me.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So, when exactly are you trying out if the tunnels aren't yet  built?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, this would be taking someone -- the two or three miles to  the destination.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  OK.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, they're actually going to put people in that tunnel near  Hawthorne, California.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does anybody think Elon Musk is doing too much, given that you  have a publicly traded auto company that's struggling, largely in part  because of your own shenanigans?  So, maybe you ought to focus on one  thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with all of that, he's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But he's also delivering.  And then someone asked him, is he  going to be done in Elon time or real-time, and he said, I hope real-time,  but yes, he has his hands in many baskets but he is delivering on this, and  especially in Los Angeles where the traffic is terrible.  Look, this could  be the future of transportation and the future might be here and now or at  least the start of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you listen to that Joe Rogan podcast, the whole thing, he  clearly is, like, the permitting process is impossible in Los Angeles,  right?  And so, to act like this is going to solve the problems of  commuters in Los Angeles is a bit farfetched.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But they don't have a good metro station there.  </p><p>KELLY:  I would rather ride this than go on SpaceX to Mars, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My point is that, well, you know what, you're going to be able  to go to Mars before you can drive around to L.A. in a tunnel.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't know.  What do you guys think will happen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's going to take time --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Decades.  Centuries. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- with the regulations.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's gotten exemptions from certain authorities to do the test  tubes of this, if you will, but you're right.  Now, they do have to come  through with the overall permitting process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Lauren, thank you.  Coming up,  still ahead, battle at the border, details on the migrant caravan with over  5,000 people in it approaching the United States, that's next hour right  here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.

Great to see you this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Nice to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to start the week off  with thinking there will be new tax cuts, right -- tax cuts 2.0, making  things permanents.  That's a great way to start the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It's an excellent way to go into the midterms.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump is trying to  get that economy, because that's his strongest issue -- number one in the  eyes of voters.  Because the latest Fox News poll, it was actually health  care.  And Republicans are a little bit back on their heels on the health  care issue.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  That's why he's been talking about pre-existing conditions too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because they're running -- 50 percent of the ads that  Democrats are running are about health care.  And many of them focusing on  pre-existing conditions and trying to message that Republicans want to  remove those protections.</p><p>But in terms of the polling -- 47 percent approval rating for the President  according to the new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll -- his highest during his  time in office.  The enthusiasm gap has closed to 4 percentage points,  that's a very small advantage for the Democrats.</p><p>And to Heather's point earlier, \"The Cook Report\", nonpartisan, finds that  parties are dead even on the question of who should control Congress in  districts rated as the most competitive -- dead even.  And there was a 13  percentage point advantage for the Democrats just in the last month's poll  among registered voters.  So that advantage has disappeared.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why.  I saw an ad this weekend.  It's like do you  want Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house?  And I was like no.  I  was like -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Maxine Waters running the Financial Services  Committee?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Elijah Cummings or Jerry Nadler running the  Judiciary?  </p><p>KELLY:  That's the best ad.  It's like ok, you don't have to like us.  You  just don't want them to be in control of the House.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  In fact, when I wrote the piece publicly predicting that Trump  was going to win, when he was at his nadir that August, I said what's going  to happen to Republican voters even those who don't like how Trump talks  and don't like other things about him, they're going to look at the  alternative of what Hillary would mean in terms of continued policies, et  cetera.  And they're going to hold their noses and they're going to vote  for Trump and join the people who were voting for him.</p><p>And the same thing is going to happen with these midterm elections.  While  the spin is being put on it, which is not incorrect, that if the  Republicans lose the House, this creates a fantastic foil for Trump and  almost guarantees re-election in 2020.</p><p>The reality is, is that he wants a Republican Congress because he's running  on fulfilling his promises and getting things done, which is also going to  make him impossible to beat in 2020.  What you're seeing in the polls is  exactly what all of our work, all this year was.</p><p>And we kept saying to the Republicans, the economy alone is not going to be  your winning issue.  You're going to get really taken to the cleaners by  the left on health care and on your supposed cruelty on immigration and you  better be prepared.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks like the President at this point is expecting Biden to  be on the other side of the podium in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's at the top of polls in terms of Democratic contenders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the President now has a name for him -- 1 percent, Joe -- 1  percent or something else.  The name came out this weekend.  You knew that.   Ok, well this is who the President is taking serious.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It's also the public said this because Biden is the best known  name, right, in their heads in terms of presidential aspiration.  Over time  that's going to shift.  Biden tends to want to be anointed, not to actually  have to work for things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He also has historically had a lot of trouble fund raising.  So  that is to his disadvantage in terms of running for the Democratic  nomination -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which is what keeps Nancy Pelosi front and center in the  party.  She's a great fundraiser.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  Phenomenal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- something else walks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- actually something else actually talks too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Our top story this hour is the looming crisis at the border --  another issue for the midterm elections.  The migrant caravan from Honduras  has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.  It  crossed into Mexico over the weekend and it sets up a potential showdown at  the U.S. border where President Trump says he will use the military if  necessary to stop these people from coming in.</p><p>Here now is Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman -- thanks  very much for joining us.</p><p>First, let me get your thoughts on this migrant caravan, your reaction to  this.  What should the U.S. do?  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well first of all, Maria -- good  morning to everyone.</p><p>This is indicative of the fact that the situation at the border is and has  been chaotic.  We've been saying this for years.  It's critical that the  United States secure its border, build the wall, get other technology to  make sure that our borders are safe and secure.</p><p>And this is an intolerable situation.  We cannot have throngs of people  just coming across porous borders.  It's a crisis that needs to be dealt  with now.  And it needs to be dealt with in the future.  That's why we've  got to secure our border.  That's why we've got to build the wall and make  sure that our southern border is safe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your colleague, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is  introducing a bill that would fully fund the President's border wall.  You  were an original co-sponsor of the bill.  Is its going to pass the house?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Sure, it will definitely pass the House.  Of course, the  arduous task has been always the Senate, the Senate the Senate.  But yes,  it will pass the House.  It's an important bill.  It gives what we wanted,  what the President wanted to fully fund the border wall.</p><p>But also, to make sure that we have other technology because it's very  important to realize that the wall can be built in certain areas but there  are other areas where the wall can't be built.  We have to use other  advanced technologies to make sure that we keep the illegal immigration  from coming across.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how much -- Kevin McCarthy says that this bill funds $23  billion, which is what's needed for the border wall because $1.5 billion  has already been accounted for.</p><p>But this weekend when I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked him  will it pass the Senate, he goes the Senate has $5 billion towards the  border wall.  He ignored the $23 billion that Kevin McCarthy is talking  about.  So where's the disconnect?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, the disconnect clearly is that the President and the  House have a much easier task to pass what they need.  The Senate, because  of the numbers, they need to get to 60, have had a lesser number. </p><p>I will say this.  If we get the McCarthy bill passed, and I think we will  in the House, it will give the Senate particularly this year an opportunity  to sit down and get that done and build the wall in a much more robust way.</p><p>Let's face it.  We did start with $5 billion, that's a start.  I actually  sit on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee and that's very important to me.  It's important  to our subcommittee.  I think it's important to most Americans.  We're  seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really  anarchistic the border situation has become.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the bottom line here in terms of the economic  proposals out of the administration.  Over the weekend, the President said  that another round of tax cuts is in the works aimed at the middle class.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be some time just prior I would say to November.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the status of this legislation?  I mean, you know, the  House is on -- out on recess until the midterms.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we'll be back in November, hopefully looking forward to  a new Republican majority in both houses; but having said that it's very  important to realize that the first round of tax cuts was very important.   We had to get corporate done.  We did.  That's making America competitive  again.  We put more money in the hands of hard-working Americans.</p><p>But we need to refine it now.  Obviously it was so important to get tax  reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually very  sad.  And I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.  </p><p>This was a very good bill the first time.  We're just going to make it  better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  But I mean the economy is growing well. </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 4.25 percent.  There's increasing worries  about the deficit.  Do we need another tax cut plan right now?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, when you look at it as an aggregate, as I've always  said, you reduce tax rates on everyone, more money actually comes into the  Treasury.  Why?  You incentivize work.  You incentivize investment.   Whether you're John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump, you realize  lower taxes means ultimately more money for the Treasury.  And I think  that's a good thing.</p><p>When we talk about deficits, we actually have to look at the spending side  of the equation and sadly really no one wants to look at that right now,  especially on the mandatory side of the equation.  Ultimately, I hope we  get there.</p><p>But if we don't have a taxing problem in America, we have a spending  problem in America.  So right now, more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans is good for the economy and good for the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Saudi Arabia and the U.S.- Saudi relations on  the line.  Secretary Mnuchin is traveling to Saudi today.  Some lawmakers  are calling for some harsh penalties against the Kingdom over its role  killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>I spoke with Senate Armed Services Committee member Lindsey Graham  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  Here's his take.  Listen to this --  Congressman.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  I'd like  to punish those involved.  The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment,  sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this.  And I find it  impossible to believe that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So go after  him and his inner circle.</p><p>Save the alliance.  I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business  with the current leadership, MBS.  He's done to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Congressman?  Does MBS, the Crown Prince  need to step down?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, first of all, let me commend President Trump.  He's  handled this crisis very well.  He demanded facts, he's getting facts.   We're getting into the investigation right now.</p><p>But his response to this and he's withholding judgment on the final  punishment -- and I think that's very smart.  Looking at it this way --  Saudi Arabia is a key actor in the Middle East.  This was a tragedy.  We  can't say it any other way.  It should not have happened.  It's an  atrocity, what happened to this journalist.  </p><p>However, we have to make sure that the punishment or the sanction fits what  they did and punishes the people who are accountable, who actually did  this.  Having said that, Saudi Arabia just made a major military purchase  from the United States, they are a key actor, if you will, a key check on  Iran and other countries in the region who have been aberrant lately.  So  we've got to have a reasoned response.</p><p>And I think President Trump has handled this perfectly.  He's looking at  it.  He's concerned about it.  He's condemned it.  But he's going to make  sure that the punishment fits the crime.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in the midterms -- Congressman, in terms  of how this plays out, 15 days away?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I'm optimistic.  Let's face it.  The Senate is trending up  very well in our great state of Tennessee.  Marsha Blackburn in a key state  is going to do very well.  I think she's going to win.  Looking across the  map, the Senate's in very good shape.</p><p>A month ago I was extremely concerned about the House.  Those competitive  House seats, though, have moved much tighter.  It's gone very well.  I  think we're going to hold the House.  It's razor-thin.</p><p>But I think Independents are going to see that the Democratic Party has  really gone off the rails.  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, like the  Republican Party, used to at least play on the same field.  The Democrats  sadly have jettisoned so far to the left -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  -- that I think the American people need to cure this and I  think Independents will do that and come out and vote for Republicans.  My  prediction -- we will hold the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Rod Rosenstein under fire, what House Judiciary  Chairman Bob Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from the deputy  attorney general when he testifies on Wednesday.</p><p>Then steal a base, win a taco -- how you can win free food during the World  Series, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>An intense manhunt is underway this morning after a police officer is shot  and killed in Georgia.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well Maria -- one suspect is  already under arrest in the death of 30-year-old officer Antoine Tony.   Police say tony and other officers were responding to calls of a suspicious  vehicle.  When the officers found that car, shots were fired from inside  and one of those shots hit Tony.  Police are now searching for 18-year-old  Tafahree Maynard, wanted for murder.</p><p>Forty-two police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year.   That's already seven more than all of last year.</p><p>Well, U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is in Moscow this week for  what's expected to be some pretty tense talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin and other officials over U.S. plans to pull out of a nuclear  arms treaty.  The Kremlin says President Trump's decision is a cause for  deep concern.  It would make the world a more dangerous place.</p><p>Senator Rand Paul on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" says withdrawing from the treaty is  a bad idea.  .</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple  of months ago.  And they still regard this, this reduction of nuclear arms  and the disaster that would be nuclear war.  I don't want to see another  nuclear arms race with Russia or with any other country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the U.S. claims that Russia has violated the agreement which  forbids the use of intermediate and short range rockets.  The Kremlin  adding the U.S. has not formally communicated its intentions to leave the  treaty to Russia.</p><p>And then there is this.  Papa John's founder, John Schnatter requesting the  company, amend its poison pill plan.  Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in  the company but he's prohibited from buying more stock until July of 2019  under a poison pill plan put in place by the board of directors.  Well  Schnatter was ousted, you may remember as chairman back in July after  racially-charged comments he made on a conference call leaked out to the  press.</p><p>Here's the stock.  Shares of Papa John's are down about 7 percent so far  this year.  And Maria -- as you can see on the chart, the pressure has been  on that stock as Schnatter's troubles have increased.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.</p><p>All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a shakeup at CBS, the details as interim chairman, Richard  Parsons, is stepping down from the board now just a few weeks after  entering.</p><p>Then Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings -- we break down  those numbers.  As you can see, Hasbro now down 9 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are higher ahead of the open this morning.  Investors are bracing  for the biggest week of third quarter earnings yet this week.</p><p>Dow Industrials up better than 90 points ahead of all of these earnings  coming out, a third of a percent.  We've got big names like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet -- all set to report.  Those are Nasdaq  companies.  And the Nasdaq is up this morning as you see all the numbers  coming out from a number of companies -- Caterpillar, McDonald's, also  market movers there.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about that is Wells Fargo senior global equity  strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- it's good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us this morning.</p><p>What are your expectations for earnings and heading into the earnings  season, is it priced in to markets?  </p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Well, Maria --  good morning.</p><p>And I think what really people want to know, what the market wants to know  is -- we know these earnings are going to be good overall -- 20 percent,  maybe a little bit more than that.  But I think what the market really  wants to hear about is what's going to happen in 2019 because clearly  earnings growth in 2019 is going to be nowhere near what it is this year.</p><p>And then of course, you know, what's the cost?  What are these tariffs  doing to costs?  Is there wage pressure?  Anything that affects margins.   So I think that's what's really more important than the absolute results  because, you know, we know they're going to be good results.  </p><p>KELLY:  Scott -- it's pretty interesting what's happening in the market  right now and that's obviously the dislocations seem to be about one of  those costs and that's the rising cost of capital, right, going up.</p><p>But to me, it doesn't seem like the Fed is really, you know, making a  mistake here, given that inflation's up about 2.5 percent over the last 12  months but their Fed funds rate is still below that, so it's negative on  real terms.</p><p>Where do you see the Fed going next year?  Where do you see rates going?   And how is that going to impact where the market goes for the next year?   Because it seems if we're only up 4 percent so far this year, could we have  another year next year where it's only up a couple percent?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think, you know, as far as our fixed income group, they're  looking for a hike in December which I think the Fed is certainly directing  the market toward that.  They're also looking for three more next year, so  basically between now and the end of 2019, looking for four more hikes.</p><p>From an equity strategy point of view, we think that that -- you know,  that's really -- you're kind of at the red line and I think the market is  going to be very sensitive to any hint or conversation or enthusiasm out of  Jay Powell that, you know, hey, we might increase the pace here, which I  think would -- the market would not take very well.</p><p>Now, as far as the S&amp;P 500 right now, at least based on our analysis,  stocks are pretty close to fair value.  Our year-end target has been 2800  to 2900.  We're just a touch below there.  And I think probably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, you could see the S&amp;P 500 -- let's call  it 8 percent higher than where we are now.</p><p>So even though we think stocks are pretty fairly valued right now, still  think there's some upside here, still think the bull market is not over.   We still want to lean towards those sectors that are sensitive to a  continuation of the recovery.  We don't want our clients hiding right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott-- it's Dagen McDowell.  What do you make of the \"Wall  Street Journal\" highlights slowing sales growth and how that's a major head  wind for the markets?  Noting that third quarter sales are expected to be  up 7.3 percent from the same period last year, this is for the S&amp;P 500.   But that is the lowest rate for the S&amp;P in four quarters. </p><p>And Lindsey Bell has been on this program and voiced her concerns as well  about that.  </p><p>WREN:  You know, Dagen-- last quarter I have to say we were looking for  about -- in the second quarter we were looking for about 8 percent growth  and it came in close to 10 percent.  So our number for this third quarter  reporting season was 8 percent and we're a touch below that.</p><p>So, you know, I would consider really anything, you know, at this point in  the cycle, anything you know, 6 to 8 percent maybe 9 -- 6 to 9 percent  earnings growth or revenue growth, rather, I think that's good.  And I  think next year you'll probably see something at the lower end of that  range.</p><p>But I think that's what the market expects.  It's probably priced in and  really, you know, 7 percent or 8 percent earnings growth in the third  quarter I don't really think that's going to bother investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would put new money to work right here then, Scott?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely -- Maria.  You know, we're going to open this morning  basically sitting right on the 200 day moving average.  And we closed below  it a time or two over the last couple of weeks.  But right now I think  you're at a point where if you have money on the sidelines, you need to  start legging in.  And if we trade a little bit lower here, you should  continue to do that.</p><p>So if you have a certain amount of money, you know, at these levels, put a  third of it in and if we go a little bit lower, step in with another third  because if you think as I do that a trade war is unlikely, that we're going  to continue to see decent international growth that's based on what our  economists are looking at, we're going to see decent growth here in the  U.S., then the forward fundamentals look pretty good.  And we want our  clients stepping in here and getting exposure if they have cash on the  sidelines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Scott -- we'll be watching.  Thanks so much.  Scott  Wren -- </p><p>WREN:  All right.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us there from Wells Fargo.</p><p>Coming up, a college party turns into a nightmare -- The latest  developments after the floor collapses, injuring at least 30 people.</p><p>Then, demanding answers, what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein this upcoming Wednesday when Rosenstein testifies.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 22nd.   Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>A higher start for the week for stock prices.  Take a look, markets are at  the highs right now, Dow Industrials set to open up about 100 points this  morning, that's almost one half of one percent higher.  NASDAQ is up three- quarters of a percent right now, that's the high of the morning, up 54  points on the NASDAQ.  And the S&amp;P is off third of a percent, 10 points  higher.  </p><p>This after a mixed day on Friday for the major indices at the close.  The  DowIndustrials were up 65 points, a quarter of a percent.  But the NASDAQ  was lower and the S&amp;P was also down one point on the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look, markets are seeing some gains here as  well.  FT-100 up almost one percent, 59 points higher.  CAC Quarante in  Paris up a half a percent, 23 points higher.  DAX Index in Germany up two- thirds of one percent, 77 points higher.  </p><p>Asian markets also closed higher overnight, China was the best performer,  Shanghai Composite up better than four percent.

The interview will be closed --  will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will be  transcribed.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte telling me  yesterday in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" what  investigators are looking for specifically.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We want to  know in particular about the new developments that we've been made aware of  about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees  and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the  president of the United States.  His boss, the chief executive officer of  our country.  </p><p>And the possibility of pulling together cabinet members to invoke the 25th  Amendment to the United States constitution which would be a mechanism to  declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice  president presumably serving in his place.  </p><p>These are very, very serious allegations.  We have all of this based upon a  newspaper report and we have third party testimony that we've heard in our  investigation.  We know he's met with President Trump.  President Trump has  been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two  at the Department of Justice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOODLATTE:  But the Congress has oversight responsibility so we're going to  ask him about those questions along with many other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial an analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  You only --  good morning.  You almost can't make this up really when you -- when you  think about it.  The people that Congressman Goodlatte's folks have  interviewed were not in the room when deputy attorney general Rosenstein  said this.  He doesn't seem to be much of as it be whether or not he said  it.  He says it was sarcastic.  Three people in the room say it was  sarcastic.  One person in the room, Andrew McCabe, fired from the FBI for  lying, said I interpret it seriously.  </p><p>The president either isn't worried about it or is biding his time until  after the midterm elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's more that's going to be on the -- on the  table obviously on Wednesday with Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goodlatte is also looking to get to the bottom of what was said  to the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When they actually applied for a warrant to wiretap someone who  worked with the Trump campaign which of course is Carter Page.  And what  we've heard now from John Ratcliffe as well as Congressman Goodlatte is  that the Obama administration officials withheld information to the FISA  court in order to get that warrant.  Here's Bob Goodlatte on that issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  There's a lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements  and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that.  He came into this matter at  the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal  of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court in  secret to approve a wiretap on an individual, who's a United States citizen  and this went on for a full year.  The last three months of which Mr.  Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.  So we have questions for  him about that and we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, judge?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, I've been a very harsh critic for FISA for a  long time.  In my view, it is a corrupt way for the Justice Department to  use the lower FISA standard, probable cause of communicating with a foreign  person as opposed to the higher constitutional standard, you get a warrant,  probable cause of crime, in order to get the camel's nose under the tent.   In order to start listening to what someone is saying because they don't  have probable cause of crime but they do have probable cause of talking to  a foreign person.  Carter Page hasn't been charged with anything.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They served failed every conceivable thing about him for a  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was such -- he was such an enemy of the state, you would  have seen charges by now.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why the story outrages me.  And you know, the fact, what  John Ratcliffe told us is that when you have two pieces of information, you  have one thing from the unverified dossier to present to the FISA court,  then you have another piece of information that completely refutes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It refutes anything that Trump had anything to do with Russia  collusion, but they didn't present that to the FISA court.  They held that  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think -- I think you and I talked, maybe it was last week  about an experience I had on the bench where I learned that when  investigators came to me for an emergency search warrant which I signed.   They did not tell me what they also knew about it.  Years later, trying the  case, I said how did you get this -- how did you get this search warrant?   Did you tell the judge about this?  Not realizing that it was me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And I threw the charges out.  </p><p>So, the consequences of misbehavior by agents of the executive branch,  whether at the state level where I was or the federal level which is what  we're talking about, by not telling everything to the court can be  catastrophic for whatever they are trying to accomplish.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's Maria's issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are on the story like no one else, not just in T.V. but in  the media in general.  Because it falls by the wayside as people move on to  like out -- the outrage at the moment.  This is outrageous.  Because there  aren't any consequences.  Will anybody ever pay for doing this?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- who knows?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's put this in context of where we are, ia presidential  election year, the year is 2016.  You had one team wanting to spy on the  other team.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You had Hillary's team and the Obama administration saying you  know what, let's spy on Trump.  Let's do this.  And then, they get the  warrant to do so.  It's wrong.  It's disgusting.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two aspects here that we haven't talked about and that  is when the president of the United States said I'm going to release all  this FISA stuff, I haven't seen it but my people -- but my people have seen  it.  Who went to him and begged him not to?  British intelligence and  Israeli intelligence, which tells you their fingerprints are on it.  Which  tells you that through Jack Brennan the Obama administration was more  likely than not using foreign intelligence to commence its surveillance of  then candidate Trump and the people are watching them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they were just trying to do whatever they could to spy on  the political enemy.  It's as simple as that.  They wanted to spy on their  political enemy.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yet again, but it was also Susan  Rice didn't have -- she used surveillance, right?  She put in for the  application.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then unmasked everybody.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one -- I don't know this to be so.</p><p>KELLY:  This is getting back (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one that got this information to the  Washington Post.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And then they leaked it.  The strategy was  incredible.  </p><p>First, come up with this narrative, that Trump had anything to do with  Russia meddling.  Then, leak it to the media, let it -- get it into the  site guys.  Then, get informants to lure Trump people and say, Donald  Junior, let's go do a meeting, I've got this informant.  They're all  informants.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are some very angry Republicans about what Congressman  Goodlatte told you yesterday and who are they?  Republicans on the  committee that are not permitted to participate in this interrogation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan say Rosenstein's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- writing the rules for his own testimony because it was Rod  Rosenstein who said, you know what, we want two Republicans and two  Democrats in the room.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, when that happens and when it is recorded -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  on Wednesday.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  And then goes to the Intelligence Committee to  whitewash any classified material.  Then Republicans will leak their  version and Democrats will leak their version.  Yet again, instead of  letting the American people see that what the people we sent to Washington  to work for us are doing -- excuse me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  With the power we gave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that, declassify.  And President needs --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They talked the -- they talked the president out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  The president needs to declassify these  documents so the American people can understand what went on here.  Is this  going to have a factor in the midterm?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  When and when and if it comes out, I think  it will be too late.  I don't -- I don't think this can -- this can come  out in the next two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham also had a lot to say about this and he's going  to be doing a 13 city tour.  He's now, you know, looked at by the  Republican as the guy to sell their colleagues.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he became very popular when in the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  After Kavanaugh.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- in the midst of the Kavanaugh hearings, enough was enough,  I'm tired of this prosecutor from Arizona asking the questions, I'm tired  of what the Democrats are doing.  I'm going to take charge here and he did.   He lost his temper, or at least, it appeared that he did.  But he  galvanized a lot of the Republican base as well as all the Republicans on  the committee.  And pretty much chasing the Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because people felt like he was -- he was speaking for them.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody who was on the right felt the same way that Lindsey  Graham did.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think they're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Watching these hearings.  So, whether -- and he just spoke from  his heart.  I mean, being a very blunt, passionate southerner.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I recognize that kind of behavior.  He's like enough is enough.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Are you a one passionate southerner?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm probably more prone to expletives than the senator.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  McKenzie, do we have the sound bite of Lindsey Graham?  I want  to tell you what Lindsey Graham said about the midterm elections and  specifically this investigation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The FBI investigation.  He's expecting to be the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham is.  Here's Lindsey Graham  with me yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, the House promises to  impeach the president and Kavanaugh.  I think the Republicans will continue  to try to hold the FBI and Department of Justice accountable for abuse of  power.  </p><p>If I'm the chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year, we hold the  Senate.  I promise you we're going to find out about the Simpson -- Fusion  GPS problem.  I promise you, we're going to get to the bottom of how they  used a dossier, prepared by foreign agents, paid for by the Democratic  Party to get a warrant against an American citizen.  We're not going to  turn our back on this.</p><p>If I'm chairman, we're going to get to the bottom of this.  And the only  way for me to be chairman is for us to hold the Senate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if the Republicans hold the senate, as seems likely, if  the Democrats take the House which this morning seems likely, the two  chairs of the Judiciary Committee couldn't be more opposite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerry Nadler.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And all the stuff that Congressman Goodlatte wants to come  out, the Democrats take the House, we'll never see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It goes away.  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Another consequence of this midterm election.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, great to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know I was kidding, McD.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know you were -- of course you were -- not really, actually.   Expletive, expletive, expletive.  You're lucky I didn't say -- you know  what, if I was really mad, I'd say --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I want to hear you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  coming up, major changes at CBS to tell you about, the details  as interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning from the company's board,  that's next.</p><p>And then a brawl on the basketball court, why three players and the lead  singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were ejected.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Get this, a college party turned into a  nightmare.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl, what a story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  These poor kids, Maria.  About  30 people sent to the hospital after a floor suddenly gave way beneath them  during a party near the campus of Clemson University.  This happened in  South Carolina.  The whole thing captured on a party-goers iPhone.  </p><p>Yes, well, a witness says people were jumping to a popular song when the  floor just caved in.  Clemson said the police said none of the injuries are  luckily, life-threatening.  </p><p>Well, the interim chairman of CBS resigned after a month on the job due to  health issues.  Richard Parsons is stepping down after his doctors told him  to reduce his workload so he can deal with complications from multiple  myeloma.  Strauss Zelnick, another new board member is going to take over  for Parsons.  Shares of CBS are down three percent so far this year.  </p><p>Then there is this, guys, Senator Elizabeth Warren defending her decision  to take a DNA test to prove she is indeed part Native American.  So, at a  debate yesterday for her Senate seat, Warren said that she did it to,  quote:  Rebuild trust in the government through transparency.  </p><p>In March, Warren had said that no DNA test was needed to prove her claim  but she said she ultimately took the test which showed a relative six to 10  generations ago was indeed Native American.  And we played the ad for our  viewers last week, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what was -- what was that, one, 1000.  </p><p>CASONE:  Six to 10 generations.  Six grandparents ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the -- at the -- at the least, she is one, 1,024th native  American, which would put here at a lower percentage than the average  European-American in terms of the percentage of their background that is  Native American.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we still talking about this?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because she can't shut up about it.</p><p>KELLY:  Because Democrats --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She thinks the more she talks about it, she's somehow going to  be right.  Number one, she caved in to President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number one.  Number two, Harvard law school was presenting her  as their first woman of color.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In print.  Harvard law spokesman -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, she did gain them -- she gained from lying.  </p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  This is --  this is why it mattered.  As she was technically their minority person on  their faculty.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And so she deliberately traded on this part of status of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You know, which is not knowing that it was in any way true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Are you a Taco Bell fan?  We will tell you how you  can score a free taco during the World Series, next.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are seven weeks into the NFL season.  The standings are  beginning to take shape.  Jared Max said the Chiefs are on top in the AFC.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria, the AFC really  looks like a two-team race between the Chiefs and the Patriots.  </p><p>One week after New England handed Kansas City its first loss, on the last  second field goal, Kansas City barbecued the Bengals, 45-10.   PatrickMahomes, four more touchdown passes, the Chiefs goes to 6-1, 45-10.  </p><p>Because of a snap penalty against Dallas, the Cowboy's 47-yard potential  game tying field goal became a 52-yarder.  Would have been good for 47, but  the Redskins win.  First place Redskins beat the Cowboys 20-17.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Losers, the Cowboys.  Losers.  Continue, Jared.  </p><p>MAX:  The Carolina Panthers -- the Carolina Panthers came back from 17 down  to beat the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles by three.  Panthers' Eric  Reid earlier had to be restrained before the opening coin toss.  Reid went  after the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and other players.  </p><p>Now, last year Jenkins co-founded the NFL players coalition to work with  the league on social justice issues.  Now, Jenkins no longer kneels for the  anthem.  Reid does.  And he thinks Jenkins is a sellout.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC REID, SAFETY, PANTHERS:  I believe Malcolm capitalized on the  situation.  He co-opted the movement that was started by Collin to get his  organization funding.  It's cowardly.  He sold us out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Sold them out, wow.  </p><p>And football, we have feistiness and also in the NBA.  After Saturday's  Lakers, Rockets game, became fight night at L.A. at the NBA, suspends three  players total of nine games without pay.  Chris Paul of the Rockets, two  games suspended.  He poked Rajon Rondo in the eye.  Rondo started to punch  Paul.  He got three games, one more than Paul, because he threw the first  punch and appears to have spit right at Chris Paul.  Now, this instigated  the fight.  Rondo throws a several punches and the Lakers Brandon Ingram  gets four games.  Wow.  </p><p>World Series begins tomorrow night on Fox at Fenway Park.  The Red Sox  favored to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Chris Sale will be Boston's game  one starter, likely Clayton Kershaw for L.A.  </p><p>World Series provisionally Taco Bell will give out free Doritos tacos --  free Doritos Locos Tacos, got to go crazy, for four hours on November 1st,  all we have to see is a base get stolen in the World Series and the free  Doritos Locos Tacos is yours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, bring on the Locos Tacos.  </p><p>MAX:  Two quiero, Taco Bell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p>CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.   Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government  revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.  </p><p>Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi  Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action  against the kingdom.  This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad  bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their  condolences.  </p><p>Plus, caravan crisis.  The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United  States border is growing.  It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on  that caravan.</p><p>On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol  Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House  investigators.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p>We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p>So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p>KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p>HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p>He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p>The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p>And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p>And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p>And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p>And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p>We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p>YORK:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p>The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p>ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p>YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p>We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p>Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p>HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p>YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p>The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p>And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p>However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p>So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p>We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p>The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p>Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p>And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p>OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p>Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p>European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p>The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p>All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p>FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p>FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p>FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p>FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p>FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p>FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p>FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p>FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p>FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p>FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p>FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p>News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.

Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p>I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p>I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p>Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p>SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning  to you.  Thank you so much.  Happy Monday.  We'll see you in a little bit,  girls.  Thank you.  It is Monday, October 27th -- October 22nd.  Good  morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher.  Here are your top stories.  6:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting for gains, futures indicating the markets this morning will open  fractionally better on the session.  Dow Industrials up 25, NASDAQ up 31  right now, half a percent higher.</p><p>This after a mixed story on Wall Street on Friday.  The market snapped a  two-day losing streak, posting a slight gain on the session with the Dow  Industrials up 65 points, quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  weaker on Friday at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are edging higher, take a look.  FT-100 up  a half percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany up one-third of a percent, 40 points higher. </p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board at the close.  And as you see,  the Shanghai Composite, the best performer out of China, up better than  four percent on the session.</p><p>Stocks in china soaring.  The government revealing tax changes to help  support the slowing economy.  And with that, a multi-move across the board,  and the averages, best in four years.</p><p>Investors bracing for the busiest week of earnings season so far.  Ten Dow  Components due to report their third quarter earnings, plus technology  giants Amazon and Alphabet on deck this week.</p><p>On Friday, we get the first look at third quarter GDP.  That could be a  market mover.  We'll break it all down and we got all the preview on  earnings as well.</p><p>Another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says that  he wants to get something done before November eight days from now, what  that means ahead of the midterm elections this morning.</p><p>And upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is headed to  Saudi Arabia today, amid pressure to take action against the Kingdom after  it admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham telling me on Sunday Morning Futures he felt used by  the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he's open to keeping the arms  seal -- sales deal on track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it impossible to believe  that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So, go after him and his inner  circle, save they alliance.</p><p>I don't mind military sales, but I cannot do business with the current  leadership.  MBS, he's done to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus, caravan crisis, thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into Mexico  with their sights on the U.S.A.  We're going to take you live to the border  to get an update on that caravan this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and Independent Women's Voice CEO,  Heather Higgins, is here this morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Thank you </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK INVESTMENTS:  It's going to be a  hectic week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hectic week because of earnings, hectic week because of?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  GDP out on Friday.  We find out how fast this country was  growing in the third quarter and if we need more tax cuts, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  President said that on the campaigns trial on  Saturday, but it's also a huge week for earnings.  We've got technology in  the spotlight, Amazon and Alphabet may very well move markets.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, big time.  Especially because I'm looking forward to Verizon  tomorrow because they're going to talk about their 5G rollout.  They did it  in four different cities.  So, that's the way with the future.  </p><p>We'll see how much capital they need to put into that.  That's part of the  Infrastructure Bill.  Remember the President keeps talking about  infrastructure?  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, 5G is part of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The GDP number on Friday, Dagen, I guess the, you know, Atlanta  Fed was all the way up at, what, four -- better than 4.5 percent, 4.8  percent or so?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we now on that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the Wall Street Journal, in its estimate, so it was 4.2  percent in the second quarter, but the third quarter is expected to come in  at 3.4 percent in the preliminary reading.  A wide -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still a good number.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A widening trade gap could be a drag on third quarter GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Based on the Journal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  So good backdrop, Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It is now.  And they're -- the administration's really happy with  anything over three percent just because we --- they keep saying --  everybody said even three percent was impossible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  We're so happy to have anything over three percent.  That is  great.  And so -- but they're looking at these four percent plus numbers  and they're thrilled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you get the biggest week of third quarter earnings so far.   That's going to also show you some real growth.  That means like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent company, Alphabet, all setting to report along  with 10 Dow Components.</p><p>On the economic side, the highlight of the week, of course, is that GDP  report.  And in terms of what we're going to see in terms of market  expectations.  Pretty much baked in a better than three percent number?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think it is.  One of the things that has weighed on  economists has been the tariffs, and so that's why the look-through into  tech earnings this week is, what have the implications been.  </p><p>Especially when you think about Apple, they come out next week.  They  haven't updated the guidance, but they said the tariffs are a tax on  consumers.  So, how is that going to impact their phone sales, especially  because they came out with new releases?  </p><p>I think it's interesting to note that technology stocks are only valued  seven percent higher than the general market.  The market's trading about  15.9 times earnings, tech's around 16.6, but they have twice the profit  margins.</p><p>So, let's see what the guidance is coming forward.  So you saw Goldman  Sachs even came out earlier this week.  I mean, last week.</p><p>They were talking about how tech isn't overvalued and that this the selloff  has been unwarranted, but it's important to note that investors have been  rotating into safer names.</p><p>They don't think we're going to get 10, 20, 30 percent returns going  forward.  They went into consumer staples stocks.  Consumer staples stocks  are up 3.5 percent over the last month.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Technology stocks are down 3.5 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to also watch out for, the Wall Street Journal writes  about this in today's paper.  Slowing sales growth.</p><p>So instead of earnings, because, again, if sales growth slows -- and we  have had, according to the Journal, 35 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies  have reported so far.  Based on our estimates, it's actually 38 percent,  miss-sales forecasts.</p><p>If sustained, that quarterly sales miss-ratio would mark the highest so far  this year.  So again, if you're coming up short on sales for whatever  reason, whether it's higher prices that you -- you're not -- that you're  trying to pass on and people aren't buying it, whatever the reason, that  doesn't bode well for earnings growth into next year.  </p><p>And sales are only growing, are expected to grow 7.3 percent, which is  slightly lower than expectations going into this quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, the guidance is going to be reflecting what the  expectations are on the trade situation, right?  On tariffs.</p><p>Because if we start -- this is when we're going to know.  I mean, companies  should probably guide us toward us, \"All right, we're going to see lower  sales than expected because of the tariffs.\"</p><p>I don't know that's the case, but I would imagine this is the quarter when  we find out if, in fact, it is going to weigh on earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the most important thing that the market's going to  focus is operating margins.  They think margins are going to come down and  be compressed because several factors.  Some of them are the rising input  costs, now we're seeing inflation's going up.  </p><p>We're also seeing labor costs are going up, costs of goods are going up.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So the problem is this, how are they going to be able to maintain  that, if they're not able to get more productivity out of their workers?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  If you can pass on these higher costs, which like with  Unilever, some of the big consumer products companies, then that's good  news. The -- </p><p>I mean not ultimately to the customer, but it's good news for the companies  again, but it's -- again, the higher input costs, you can't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  For whatever reason, it's not just tariffs.  Watch a lot of  companies potentially, if they're coming up short, start to blame tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're going to have to kind of comb through the -- try and  separate the fact from the fiction.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It'll be -- </p><p>KELLY:  Also the storm, they'll see that in -- about the storms, right?  So  we -- they'll think next quarter's going to be weak because of the storms,  whatever's happening.</p><p>We've seen -- Home Depot should be strong, but they actually got a  downgrade last week because they think the consumer's not going to be as  strong in upgrading their homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, whatever weakness we see, the President's trying to  offset it now with talk of more tax cuts ahead of the election. </p><p>He spoke to reporters just this weekend about a package that they're  working on right now.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be sometime, just prior I would say to November.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, Election Day is 15 days away at this point, November  1st.  Ten days away.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He didn't say which November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, of course, you know, Congress is out of session until  after the November Elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe he comes out with an announcement before midterm  elections, but we're not going to see a vote, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  And quite frankly, the deficit is becoming -- it's starting  to become an issue for politicians and for the American people.</p><p>President Trump said \"I'm ordering all my cabinet secretaries to cut their  spending by 5 percent.  But discretionary spending is what one-third --  roughly one-third of the entire budget every year.  And if you cut out  defense, it's a cut -- I think it represents less than one percent of  overall spending.</p><p>So again, I don't -- he -- it would take -- it's a long road to plow in  terms of pushing through a tax cut at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we know they want to make the individual cut permanent and  we know that that's going to be on their agenda should they have the  opportunity, even after the midterm elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe it --I mean he said Kevin Brady is working on it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  House, Ways and Means.  So maybe it's an announcement from  House, Ways and Means before the midterms.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It could be.  They won't get anything passed.  But it's been  pretty clear that even though they passed the first tax cut, that even  though they were constrained by certain prior agreements to have the  individual cuts be temporary, the goal was always to make those be  permanent.</p><p>You are now seeing a recovery which, for the first time in a very long  time, is being led by blue-collar job growth, blue-collar wages, small  business confidence, rather than leading from the top.</p><p>It's sort of from the bottom.  And those people are going to be going into  the midterms looking at this fantastically booming economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Trump's approval ratings are now higher than Obama's were going  into his first midterms.  And his disapproval ratings have actually come  down, layering on a promised middle-class tax cuts can't hurt.</p><p>And -- because serious way, if you want to take on the deficit, and this  may be the one President who can cut through the swamp and actually get  this done, because the creatures on both sides of the aisle like the  current services baseline, economic gains that would never, ever be allowed  in the private sector in terms of automatic budget increases and claiming.  </p><p>Because, you know, they get to claim to these two different constituents  coming into their office and for the exact same thing, they get to claim  that they were either cutting it or increasing it because of the semantics  involved with the built-in increases.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  If you're serious about taking on the deficit, then have you to  be serious on taking on the financial accounting games that are played in  Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's Saudi Arabia on deck as well.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin now defending his decision to go to Saudi.  He's meeting  with Saudi officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p>He says the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at this critical moment.   He's not going to that conference, but this trip comes after Saudi Arabia  said that Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was in fact killed  in a fist fight inside the Istanbul Consulate.</p><p>The Kingdom is forcefully denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  Lawmakers, though, are showing  skepticism on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Did the Crown Prince know anything  about it?  If there were people closely tied to him involved in this  operation?</p><p>ADEL BIN AHMED AL-JUBEIR, DIPLOMAT, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:   There weren't people closely tied to him who were involved in this  operation.  This was an operation that was a rogue operation. </p><p>This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities  and responsibilities they had.</p><p>GRAHAM:  it's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to  kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it.  That would  be brazen abuse of authority.</p><p>He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in  Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will quote the Wall Street Journal editorial today on this  very issue.  Saudi Arabia needs to step up.  We still don't know -- they  haven't produced Khashoggi's body, provided more details of precisely how  or when he decide.</p><p>The story doesn't add up.  Of the 18 people arrested, five others sacked,  several a part of Mohammed bin Salman the inner circle.  It's unlikely they  would have acted alone without at least, you know, feeling a tacit assent  from the Crown Prince.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial goes on to write, \"The U.S. goal should  be to preserve our alliance with Saudi Arabia while making clear that  murdering journalists is unacceptable and that Mohammed bin Salman's  erratic judgment and willful use of power are problems for the bilateral  relationship.\"</p><p>We can't dictate what King Salman will do about who should run Saudi  Arabia, but you can -- but Mohammed bin Salman also can't be allowed to  conclude that America thinks this is no big deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they've got to do something.  The U.S. has to do  something to push back in the face of this heinous situation.</p><p>Question is, does Mohammed bin Salman survive?  He's got two other sons.   There are a lot of people who want this guy out at this point.  Lindsey  Graham included.</p><p>So big question here, you know, I mean, the arms sales is going -- it's  going to go through.  The relationship is going to go through because  there's one big black eye here that we're faced with and that is Iran, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the muddled response from this administration and the uneven  response that we've seen since this all began, we need to be on very firm  footing about the message, like Lindsey Graham said that we send to King  Salman about who we -- who should run the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  I want to disagree.  I think that the administration has been  taking a difficult situation.  These are people that behaved really badly,  like so many of the people we've had to deal with.  And they've got this  challenge of how do you negotiate making them pay for it, making them fess  up to it, but not having them lose so much for -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But comparing it to Brett Kavanaugh was a misstep.  I'm sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, it's shifting gears for FiatChrysler.  Details on the  automaker's roughly $7 billion car parts deal.  That's next.  </p><p>And then a spooky box office debut, we've got it here on Halloween.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Battle at the border for sure, a migrant caravan  moving toward the United States.  It has grown now to roughly 5,000 people.   Griff Jenkins is live in McAllen, Texas this morning with details there,  right in the middle of it.  Griff.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  When the  caravan gets to this border, if they do indeed come here, they're going to  find an overwhelmed border already with illegal crossing.  </p><p>And the Rio Grande Valley Sector where I'm standing McAllen is the busiest  sector of the entire U.S. border, and it had more than 12,700 illegal  crossing arrests in just the last three weeks.  </p><p>Over the weekend, over 800 pounds of marijuana confiscated, and it is part  of the problem here they're seeing is also family units, women and children  coming, much like the caravan of migrants from Central American countries.</p><p>We spent time yesterday with the Sector Chief, a guy named Manuel Padilla,  talking about the caravan that's coming and what he says is a need for more  infrastructure.  Take a listen.</p><p>MANUEL PADILLA, CHIEF, RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR:  If we had this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure throughout my border,  we would truly transform this area.  It's a win-win situation for  everybody.</p><p>This area right here, we do not see MS-13, we do not see criminal aliens  coming into this area, because of the capability that we have through this  combination of personnel, technology, infrastructure.</p><p>JENKINS:  But he's only got well and about 55 of the nearly 300 parts of  this sector and it's a busy one.  The President, Maria, will be in Houston  today and Houston is in this RGV area.  I'm sure this topic will certainly  come up.  Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins is live  McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>What a scene.  We are going to be watching that as that caravan moves  closer to where Griff is actually standing.</p><p>Switching gears, a deadly train derailment in Taiwan.  Cheryl Casone with  that right now in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, good morning.</p><p>An express train went off the tracks, killing at least 18 people.  This  happened in Eastern Taiwan.  More than 150 others were injured in this  disaster.

The deal is going  to make the newly-combined company one of the world's biggest auto parts  suppliers.</p><p>The FiatChrysler- - excuse me -- in the premarket up 4.6 percent, about.</p><p>And then finally, there is this.  The horror movie, \"Halloween,\" making a  killing at the box office this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this  night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been preparing for this for a long time. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is not safe to be on the streets tonight.

It also is the second-best October opening weekend of all time. </p><p>Holding on to second place, in its third weekend, \"A Star Is Born,\" $19.3  million.  </p><p>Rounding out top five, last week's big winner was \"Venom,\" followed by \"  Goosebumps 2:  Haunted Halloween,\" and, Maria, \"First Man.\"  </p><p>Jamie Curtis, she's still got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she does.  Good movies this weekend.  Thanks, Cheryl. </p><p>Coming up, a new way to calculate your FICO score, we will tell you why  your cash may help.  That's next.</p><p>And then Facebook goes shopping.  The technology giant's reported plan to  purchase a cybersecurity company, all right here after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Increasing access to credit, Fair Isaac, the  company behind the FICO score, is rolling out a major change, UltraFICO  Score will go beyond payment history.</p><p>According to the Journal this morning, it will factor in bank account  activity, how consumers manage their cash and checking, savings and money  market accounts.  It launches next year. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Mark Hamrick.  He's  Bankrate.com's Senior Economic Analyst.  </p><p>And Mark, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining  us.  </p><p>MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think this is about younger people, this new FICO  change.  Tell us about it.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Primarily, and we think about the fact that there's a large  portion of the U.S. population which really isn't doing business with  traditional financial service companies.  Millennial have been smart.   They're saving more money.</p><p>Our recent Bankrate survey found that about two-thirds of the American  public was essentially limiting its spending and millennials are doing the  best job of saving more money so that money is sitting in accounts not  necessarily being spent.</p><p>At Bankrate, we say that the two biggest problems that have been identified  by Americans is their failure to save for retirement and for emergencies.   So, financial companies want to create new customers and help connect them  to borrowing products.  It's a logical step for them.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there a way to opt out of this?  It's -- the last thing I want  with the Equifax hacking and everything going on about security, the last  thing I want is somebody to pull up my UltraFICO to see how much money --  cash I have in a bank account, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how you're managing all your money, and all your accounts.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Savings, checking.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes.  Well, to the question, I think you're right on.  I think  Americans are tired of having their personal information essentially taken  from them.  </p><p>And I think this is going to be something to watch in terms of regulation  in the coming years, whether it's the information that Facebook and Google  possess about us or our credit rating scores, because I think we have a  sense that we have no control over this information.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the -- with the -- this new FICO score, is this a way  to essentially offer people even more credit, if you will, that this is at  a time when people are increasingly stretched, that you've seen auto  lending particularly on the fringes of people with very low subprime auto  lending really being pulled back on?  </p><p>Is this a way to basically shine up people's credit scores and make them  more palatable to the lender?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  That's a very good question.  I think that is essentially the  tension that could be created by this.  In other words, giving loans to  people who are not well qualified. </p><p>But that, I don't think, is the intention.  Most financial service firms  are not looking to create new losses.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell has said that he thinks that household balance sheets are  in good shape.  He's more concerned about the commercial side.</p><p>So, I think this is more about trying to identify good data about consumers  and potential borrowers and connecting them to products that they might  find useful.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Meanwhile, you've got a new survey on how Americans are spending,  and if they're cutting back on spending, right?  Let's talk about that.  </p><p>Sixty-six percent say that they're living -- they're limiting spending,  thirty-six percent say that they are doing it to save money.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes, and I think this is a good thing.  As I said, you know, I  don't think there are many Americans that go essentially into their last  days saying, \"You know what, I saved too much money.\"  Ii think more  Americans regret that they didn't do a better job of saving for retirement  or emergencies.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And I think that 36 percent was only of the 66 percent that were  saving.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So it was only 24 percent overall that we're saving for longer  term.</p><p>The other thing that was interesting in the study was, there has long been  a contention that the big difference between how well you do in life is how  long your time horizon is.</p><p>And when you looked at the study, the people who were making over $50,000  clearly had a longer time horizon that they were saving for, whereas the  people who were under that were just sort of saving for the short-term  needs and they weren't thinking beyond that.</p><p>How, if we're going to move away from the Keynesian mentality, that the  more debt you have and the more spending you have, the better off we all  are, to one where people are more prudent and thinking about their savings,  how is borrowing going to help that happen?</p><p>HAMRICK:  I think essentially, it's two different questions.  I think the  first question is, as long as you have a healthy economy, most Americans  will be mindful of trying to achieve proper financial goals.</p><p>I do think in our society, we have a significant problem with lack of  financial literacy and that's an education issue, which i don't hear a lot  of people talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's too bad.  It really just starts at home.  But we're  certainly interested in that.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you this morning.  Mark Hamrick joining us from  Bankrate.com.  </p><p>Take a short break.  When we come back, Jamie Dimon's big bet, why J.P.  Morgan is building a campus in Silicon Valley.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then fixing traffic gridlock, details on Elon Musk's high-speed transit  tunnel.  It's nearly finished.  Will it offer free rides to the public?  We  will tell you about that.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, October  22nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  The major  indices on Wall Street looking to open higher this morning ahead of a big  week for earnings.  This right here is the high of the morning, up 73  points on the Dow Industrials, a quarter of a percent.  The NASDAQ is up  two-thirds of a percent, that's 42 points higher.  This after a mixed close  on Friday, all ahead of a big week in earnings.  This is one of the busiest  weeks we're going to see.  </p><p>Dow Industrials, on Friday, up 65 points at the close, a quarter of a  percent higher.  The S&amp;P500 was flat, down one point; and the NASDAQ was  lower by half a percent, 36 points lower on NASDAQ on Friday.  In Europe  this morning, take a look at indices, higher across the board.  FT-100 up  two-thirds of one percent; CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent;  and the DAX Index in Germany, up two-thirds of one percent right now.   Asian markets closed higher overnight.  The Shanghai Composite was up  strong, up four percent.  China's government revealing tax cuts over the  weekend to help boost that economy which has shown slowdown.  </p><p>Facebook is eyeing, shoring up its security.  The company reportedly  looking to make an acquisition in cyber sector.  Plus, the company faces  request a from Japan to beef up security.  Building the future.  Details on  JPMorgan Chase's newest investment in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you  what's behind that move.  And then a rare -- a rare reality.  Elon Musk  tweeting out date for his hyperloop transport.  When you can expect to take  a ride on a high-speed rail, from Elon Musk?  And forget getting candies in  your trick or treat bags.  We've got the very list of the U.S. cities  spending the most on Halloween this year -- it might surprise you.  </p><p>First though, our top story this half an hour.  Countdown to midterm  elections now 15 days away.  President Trump and former President Obama  squaring off in dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  President Trump will hit the campaign trail  in Houston in support of Ted Cruz, while former President Obama will  touchdown in Las Vegas and campaign there.  Enthusiasm for President Trump  is high, lines of supporters are already covering entire blocks as nearly  100,000 people wait to enter venue that can hold 18,000.  18,000 is what  the capacity is.  </p><p>Yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham to get his take on the most important issues on the ballot  this November.  President Trump has hand-picked Senator Graham to go out  and campaign for colleagues.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM:  I think people are going to be voting on the mob rule of the  Democratic Party.  If you like Democrats around the House, you know exactly  what you're going to get: They're going to try and impeach the president,  impeach Kavanaugh; they don't care about your wallet, they just want to get  in your wallet.  </p><p>If you keep Republicans in charge, we're going to keep the economy moving  forward, we're going to secure our border, we're going to deal with our  enemies throughout the world, we're going to rebuild our military.  And  when it comes to standing up to the world, you need a strong leader like  President Trump, and the Democratic Party has showed us what they would do  with power, not much for you.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the president has asked Lindsey Graham to go on the road;  he's going to talk -- he's going to be in 13 cities in just a couple of  days.  Joining us right now is Republican Strategist Kimberly Klacik.   Kimberly, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.   Your reaction to Senator Graham and what you might expect from him in the  next couple of days as he travels to 13 cities to campaign?  </p><p>KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I see this new Lindsey Graham that  we've been seeing, I expect good things.  I mean, he's absolutely right.   You know exactly what you're going to get if the Democrats take over the  House.  They have been intolerant lately.  The mob -- the mob name actually  fits them properly.  And I think for a lot of people, we don't really  understand whether or not there is a blue wave coming.  I'm not convinced.   In 2016, everyone said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, we saw that  Trump won and that's basically because people were afraid to show support  for Trump, so I don't think we really know what's going to happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's new line lately in his campaigns have been  \"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.\"  We saw that mob- thinking again this weekend when Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao  were harassed while they were at dinner, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and there was a panel in MSNBC that essentially justifies  this kind of behavior base on the fact that Merrick Garland didn't get a  vote in front of the Senate under Mitch McConnell.  That was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's justified.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, that that's justified.  And they're -- the message from  the Democrats is \"we are coming for you.\"  If you support Trump, we're  going to show up at your place of work, where you eat, where you live.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you deny that's not the mob?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is the mob.  I think that that's a great slogan.  He's --  President Trump is also really focused on immigration, attention to the  border wall, and in fact, I know that Joe Donnelly who is a Democrat  running for election in Indiana has actually running ads promoting his  support of President Trump on immigration -- border wall.  And radical left  talking about abolishing ICE.  So, smart Democrats like Donnelly in  Indiana, they know that this is an important issue to Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because -- and then you've got Kevin McCathy bringing the  bill to the floor right after midterms, Kimberly, to build the wall,  enforce the law -- act, that's what it is.  And voter interest in this  election has surged today record highs in both parties.  A new Wall Street  Journal/NBC News poll finds that nearly two-thirds of registered voters say  they are very interested in this year's midterms, that's the highest ever  recorded by the survey.  President Trump's job approval rating, as we just  heard, got a boost, the poll finds that approval rating now at 47 percent.   This is the highest of his time in office, Kimberly, going into these  midterm elections, what are your thoughts?  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, and it's well deserved.  You see, President Trump -- I don't  think the Democrats have identified that he's done anything wrong.  You  have to remember, usually, Democrats run on making promises, usually  promises they can't keep.  And so, right now, you have a bunch of problems  that Trump is solving on his own.  People were talking about immigration  and they should, because this is really a threat on our national security.   It's not about not wanting people to come in and live for the American  dream.  So, yes, they are absolutely right about this, and I think that is  why there's overwhelming support right now for President Trump, because  there's a lot of people on his side here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you know, Heather, when you look at these pictures of  this caravan making its way to the United States, it is just perfect timing  going into the midterm elections because it's a reminder that the president  is trying to secure the borders and have legal immigration.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  The caravan is the single largest one picture argument for a wall  that Trump could have ever asked for.  And particularly, when you see the  soldiers in Guatemala or the police there trying to stop it and getting  overrun on the fences, getting overrun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HIGGINS:  What's interesting about the poll that just came out, I've been  saying from the beginning that there was not going to be a blue wave and  that the Republicans, actually, I will predict will keep the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  And the poll has been interesting in that is now down to a nine- point Democrat advantage in the generic, but if you look in the  battleground states, it is completely even now.  I think, I think it is not  going to be the blue wave, I think it's going to be a major red wall, and  there's going to be more pick-ups in the Senate as well as holding of the  House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know I'm talking out both sides in my mouth, one problem,  though, in President Trump making immigration a front and center issue,  talking about the wall is the fact that the Republicans in control of the  Senate and the House didn't fully fund his wall, and they didn't basically  starve the sanctuary cities of money.  This is another can that's been  kicked down the road after midterms, so in some way, he's highlighting what  the Republicans haven't gotten done, but they haven't fulfilled agenda on  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely right.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Exactly.  This has been the biggest problem that Republicans have  had to overcome is their failure to follow through on things that they  promised to do, whether it was health care or taking on sanctuary cities or  border wall funding, I think part of the reason that you saw the tremendous  lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters until the Kavanaugh hearings was  that there was this disjunction, what had been promised versus what had  been delivered in the general sense of why would I bother voting for you?   Kavanaugh made it very clear why you would bother voting for them because  the alternative was much worse.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, now, Donald Trump just gave them another reason and that's  tax cut 2.0.  So, if you think about it, no better way to mobilize people  to vote than tell them you're going to do tax cut 2.0 a couple of weeks  before election.  So, I think that timing was perfect and he's now throwing  the Democrats in a (INAUDIBLE), because he's going to make them start  talking about taxes and has done very well for Republicans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: And let not forget -- let's not forget, Kimberly, not one  Democrat voted for that tax cut plan.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Yes, that's true.  So, how much are they really for the American  people?  I think that right now this is the perfect storm, like you said  the caravan coming is the perfect storm.  We have to remember, do we really  want people in our country, as the first thing they do when they get here  is break our laws?  We are a nation of laws and we deserve to know who our  neighbors are, and we should be vetting legal immigrants.  I think,  honestly, I don't see the blue wave either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kimberly, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p>KLACIK:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kimberly Klacik joining us there.  Coming up, doubling down on  data protection, details on Facebook's reported plans to purchase a  cybersecurity company, that's next.  And then getting into the Halloween  spirit, we will tell you the city spending the most money on Halloween  ahead of October 31.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New pressure this morning on Facebook over data  protection, Cheryl Casone on it in headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, the Japanese government has ordered Facebook to better  protect user data.  Japan's asking the company to fully communicate  security issues to its users and inform regulators of any change in  security measures.  This, of course, comes after Facebook said earlier this  month, hackers stole information of about 30 million people.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly planning to go buy a major cybersecurity  firm.  Reports say Facebook has approached several companies for a  potential acquisition.  Taking a look at shares of the company down 13  percent so far this year, there's Facebook.  </p><p>Well, JPMorgan Chase is planning to build a new campus that's going to  focus on Fintech or Financial Technology.  This campus is going to be out  in Silicon Valley.  More than 1,000 employees are going to work at the  campus when it opens up in Palo Alto in 2020.  A project part of an effort  by JPMorgan to keep up with changes in digital payments which is big  business.  Most of the employers are going to work for JPMorgan Chase's  merchant services division.  Shares of JPMorgan are up nearly one percent  so far this year.  </p><p>And Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry in the United States.   So, this year, Americans are expected to spend $9 billion on candy,  costumes, decorations.  That works out to an average 86 bucks per person.   And 24/7 Wall Street created an index to see which cities actually spend  the most on Halloween.  And this year, the top of the list: Number one,  Phoenix; right behind it, L.A., Honolulu, Burbank, and Paradise, Nevada.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money on candy and Halloween stuff.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's a lot of yummy candy, that's all I can say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, are we going to have some Halloween candy onset at some  point?  </p><p>CASONE:  I'm working on it.  You know I'm on that.  You read my mind. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I figured there were some story around that.  That can get some  chocolate up here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whole Foods sells vegan candy corn.  I found that yesterday.   Quite delicious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one.  Good info.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why Phoenix is number one the list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>KELLY:  Because of my sister, she goes by Pauline Halloween, and she makes  it the whole month and she spends -- I mean, this is her Super Bowl.  This  is, like, what she lives for every year.  So, I can -- that explains.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was surprised its Phoenix.  I don't know why.  </p><p>KELLY:  I'm not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of decorations here in New York are pretty funny.  People  get into it.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  My kids are now, all three, simultaneously in college, but it  wasn't too long ago where the house was decorated stem to stern and we put  in a haunted house and all the rest of it.  And now, all of that stuff  stays in the basement because we're not at trick or treat age.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A very young French girl in my building told me that she's going  as one of the pink ladies, and she said, do you know who the pink ladies  are?  And I went, my dear, I saw Greece when it was released, at drive-in  movie theater.  And she went, what's a driving --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>KELLY:  That's amazing.</p><p>HIGGINS:  That is funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, going  underground.  Elon Musk's infrastructure firm, the Boring Company gearing  up to unveil its first high-speed transit tunnel.  Details on the launch  right after this.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk out with new details about his high- speed hyperloop transport.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.   Lauren, good morning. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good morning, we have a date and we have a place.  So, this is  what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend: \"First tunnel almost done.\"  And  then he responded to a follower on Twitter, when: Well, \"opens December  10th.\"  His Boring Company on December 11th, will then take the public on  free rides of a tunnel track.  </p><p>Check this out, which will run in Hawthorne, California from SpaceX --  another one of Musk's company -- it's North 200th Street, then west from  there for about two miles.  It uses a loop system, which transports a car  or a vehicle, as you can see on platform, which they called the skate and  it basically skates you 150 miles an hour to your destination, no traffic,  no speeding ticket.  </p><p>When Musk first announced the boring company back in 2016 because he was  bored sitting in traffic, most people thought he was nuts.  But once again,  the visionary CEO making due on pie in the sky idea and inviting the public  to try it out for free and that maybe his way of faring well in the court  of public opinion because at least two of his tunnels face lawsuits.  </p><p>In California, they're worried about environment and what tunneling in  seismic-prone areas could do to residents' homes.  Now, Musk is also  working on a tunnel from Dodger's stadium to a nearby train station -- but  that one will not be opened for the World Series.  I know a lot of people  would appreciate that as we gear up for the big games tomorrow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  I think it's going to be great.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  An electric subterranean train station, essentially.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but the real question is, can my face be pulled back?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, he promised that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, I'm dead serious.  His follower said, is this is going to  be like a really cool disco-like experience?  And he said, yes, so there's  going to be something cool happening in those tunnels -- it's kind of scary  if you ask me.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  So, when exactly are you trying out if the tunnels aren't yet  built?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, this would be taking someone -- the two or three miles to  the destination.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  OK.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, they're actually going to put people in that tunnel near  Hawthorne, California.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does anybody think Elon Musk is doing too much, given that you  have a publicly traded auto company that's struggling, largely in part  because of your own shenanigans?  So, maybe you ought to focus on one  thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with all of that, he's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But he's also delivering.  And then someone asked him, is he  going to be done in Elon time or real-time, and he said, I hope real-time,  but yes, he has his hands in many baskets but he is delivering on this, and  especially in Los Angeles where the traffic is terrible.  Look, this could  be the future of transportation and the future might be here and now or at  least the start of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you listen to that Joe Rogan podcast, the whole thing, he  clearly is, like, the permitting process is impossible in Los Angeles,  right?  And so, to act like this is going to solve the problems of  commuters in Los Angeles is a bit farfetched.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But they don't have a good metro station there.  </p><p>KELLY:  I would rather ride this than go on SpaceX to Mars, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My point is that, well, you know what, you're going to be able  to go to Mars before you can drive around to L.A. in a tunnel.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't know.  What do you guys think will happen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's going to take time --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Decades.  Centuries. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- with the regulations.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's gotten exemptions from certain authorities to do the test  tubes of this, if you will, but you're right.  Now, they do have to come  through with the overall permitting process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that, Lauren, thank you.  Coming up,  still ahead, battle at the border, details on the migrant caravan with over  5,000 people in it approaching the United States, that's next hour right  here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

How  lawmakers plan to address the growing problem, coming up.</p><p>And upholding the alliance -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is headed  to Saudi Arabia this morning amid pressure to take action against the  kingdom and Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince after he -- the kingdom  admitted to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.

He will testify on  Wednesday in a transcribed interview with House Judiciary Chairman, Bob  Goodlatte.  Goodlatte gave me a preview of what to expect this weekend on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA:  There is no limitation on the scope of  these questions.  We want to know in particular about the new developments  that we've been made aware of about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of  other DOJ and FBI employees and talking about the possibility of wearing a  wire when he meets with the President of the United States.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fallout later this hour, coming up.</p><p>And another round of tax cuts could be on the way.  President Trump says he  wants to get something done before November -- that's eight days from now.   What it means ahead of the midterm elections to hear such an announcement.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.   Great to see you this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Nice to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's good to start the week off  with thinking there will be new tax cuts, right -- tax cuts 2.0, making  things permanents.  That's a great way to start the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  It's an excellent way to go into the midterms.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  President Trump is trying to  get that economy, because that's his strongest issue -- number one in the  eyes of voters.  Because the latest Fox News poll, it was actually health  care.  And Republicans are a little bit back on their heels on the health  care issue.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  That's why he's been talking about pre-existing conditions too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because they're running -- 50 percent of the ads that  Democrats are running are about health care.  And many of them focusing on  pre-existing conditions and trying to message that Republicans want to  remove those protections.</p><p>But in terms of the polling -- 47 percent approval rating for the President  according to the new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll -- his highest during his  time in office.  The enthusiasm gap has closed to 4 percentage points,  that's a very small advantage for the Democrats.</p><p>And to Heather's point earlier, \"The Cook Report\", nonpartisan, finds that  parties are dead even on the question of who should control Congress in  districts rated as the most competitive -- dead even.  And there was a 13  percentage point advantage for the Democrats just in the last month's poll  among registered voters.  So that advantage has disappeared.  </p><p>KELLY:  I can tell you why.  I saw an ad this weekend.  It's like do you  want Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker of the house?  And I was like no.  I  was like -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Maxine Waters running the Financial Services  Committee?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want Elijah Cummings or Jerry Nadler running the  Judiciary?  </p><p>KELLY:  That's the best ad.  It's like ok, you don't have to like us.  You  just don't want them to be in control of the House.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  In fact, when I wrote the piece publicly predicting that Trump  was going to win, when he was at his nadir that August, I said what's going  to happen to Republican voters even those who don't like how Trump talks  and don't like other things about him, they're going to look at the  alternative of what Hillary would mean in terms of continued policies, et  cetera.  And they're going to hold their noses and they're going to vote  for Trump and join the people who were voting for him.</p><p>And the same thing is going to happen with these midterm elections.  While  the spin is being put on it, which is not incorrect, that if the  Republicans lose the House, this creates a fantastic foil for Trump and  almost guarantees re-election in 2020.</p><p>The reality is, is that he wants a Republican Congress because he's running  on fulfilling his promises and getting things done, which is also going to  make him impossible to beat in 2020.  What you're seeing in the polls is  exactly what all of our work, all this year was.</p><p>And we kept saying to the Republicans, the economy alone is not going to be  your winning issue.  You're going to get really taken to the cleaners by  the left on health care and on your supposed cruelty on immigration and you  better be prepared.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks like the President at this point is expecting Biden to  be on the other side of the podium in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's at the top of polls in terms of Democratic contenders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the President now has a name for him -- 1 percent, Joe -- 1  percent or something else.  The name came out this weekend.  You knew that.   Ok, well this is who the President is taking serious.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  It's also the public said this because Biden is the best known  name, right, in their heads in terms of presidential aspiration.  Over time  that's going to shift.  Biden tends to want to be anointed, not to actually  have to work for things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He also has historically had a lot of trouble fund raising.  So  that is to his disadvantage in terms of running for the Democratic  nomination -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which is what keeps Nancy Pelosi front and center in the  party.  She's a great fundraiser.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  Phenomenal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- something else walks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- actually something else actually talks too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Our top story this hour is the looming crisis at the border --  another issue for the midterm elections.  The migrant caravan from Honduras  has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.  It  crossed into Mexico over the weekend and it sets up a potential showdown at  the U.S. border where President Trump says he will use the military if  necessary to stop these people from coming in.</p><p>Here now is Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman -- thanks  very much for joining us.</p><p>First, let me get your thoughts on this migrant caravan, your reaction to  this.  What should the U.S. do?  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Well first of all, Maria -- good  morning to everyone.</p><p>This is indicative of the fact that the situation at the border is and has  been chaotic.  We've been saying this for years.  It's critical that the  United States secure its border, build the wall, get other technology to  make sure that our borders are safe and secure.</p><p>And this is an intolerable situation.  We cannot have throngs of people  just coming across porous borders.  It's a crisis that needs to be dealt  with now.  And it needs to be dealt with in the future.  That's why we've  got to secure our border.  That's why we've got to build the wall and make  sure that our southern border is safe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your colleague, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is  introducing a bill that would fully fund the President's border wall.  You  were an original co-sponsor of the bill.  Is its going to pass the house?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Sure, it will definitely pass the House.  Of course, the  arduous task has been always the Senate, the Senate the Senate.  But yes,  it will pass the House.  It's an important bill.  It gives what we wanted,  what the President wanted to fully fund the border wall.</p><p>But also, to make sure that we have other technology because it's very  important to realize that the wall can be built in certain areas but there  are other areas where the wall can't be built.  We have to use other  advanced technologies to make sure that we keep the illegal immigration  from coming across.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how much -- Kevin McCarthy says that this bill funds $23  billion, which is what's needed for the border wall because $1.5 billion  has already been accounted for.</p><p>But this weekend when I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked him  will it pass the Senate, he goes the Senate has $5 billion towards the  border wall.  He ignored the $23 billion that Kevin McCarthy is talking  about.  So where's the disconnect?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, the disconnect clearly is that the President and the  House have a much easier task to pass what they need.  The Senate, because  of the numbers, they need to get to 60, have had a lesser number. </p><p>I will say this.  If we get the McCarthy bill passed, and I think we will  in the House, it will give the Senate particularly this year an opportunity  to sit down and get that done and build the wall in a much more robust way.</p><p>Let's face it.  We did start with $5 billion, that's a start.  I actually  sit on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee and that's very important to me.  It's important  to our subcommittee.  I think it's important to most Americans.  We're  seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really  anarchistic the border situation has become.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the bottom line here in terms of the economic  proposals out of the administration.  Over the weekend, the President said  that another round of tax cuts is in the works aimed at the middle class.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are looking at putting in  a very major tax cut for middle income people.  And if we do that, it will  be some time just prior I would say to November.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the status of this legislation?  I mean, you know, the  House is on -- out on recess until the midterms.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we'll be back in November, hopefully looking forward to  a new Republican majority in both houses; but having said that it's very  important to realize that the first round of tax cuts was very important.   We had to get corporate done.  We did.  That's making America competitive  again.  We put more money in the hands of hard-working Americans.</p><p>But we need to refine it now.  Obviously it was so important to get tax  reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually very  sad.  And I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.  </p><p>This was a very good bill the first time.  We're just going to make it  better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  But I mean the economy is growing well. </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 4.25 percent.  There's increasing worries  about the deficit.  Do we need another tax cut plan right now?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, when you look at it as an aggregate, as I've always  said, you reduce tax rates on everyone, more money actually comes into the  Treasury.  Why?  You incentivize work.  You incentivize investment.   Whether you're John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump, you realize  lower taxes means ultimately more money for the Treasury.  And I think  that's a good thing.</p><p>When we talk about deficits, we actually have to look at the spending side  of the equation and sadly really no one wants to look at that right now,  especially on the mandatory side of the equation.  Ultimately, I hope we  get there.</p><p>But if we don't have a taxing problem in America, we have a spending  problem in America.  So right now, more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans is good for the economy and good for the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Saudi Arabia and the U.S.- Saudi relations on  the line.  Secretary Mnuchin is traveling to Saudi today.  Some lawmakers  are calling for some harsh penalties against the Kingdom over its role  killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>I spoke with Senate Armed Services Committee member Lindsey Graham  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  Here's his take.  Listen to this --  Congressman.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  I'd like  to punish those involved.  The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment,  sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this.  And I find it  impossible to believe that the Crown Prince was not involved.  So go after  him and his inner circle.</p><p>Save the alliance.  I don't mind military sales but I cannot do business  with the current leadership, MBS.  He's done to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Congressman?  Does MBS, the Crown Prince  need to step down?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, first of all, let me commend President Trump.  He's  handled this crisis very well.  He demanded facts, he's getting facts.   We're getting into the investigation right now.</p><p>But his response to this and he's withholding judgment on the final  punishment -- and I think that's very smart.  Looking at it this way --  Saudi Arabia is a key actor in the Middle East.  This was a tragedy.  We  can't say it any other way.  It should not have happened.  It's an  atrocity, what happened to this journalist.  </p><p>However, we have to make sure that the punishment or the sanction fits what  they did and punishes the people who are accountable, who actually did  this.  Having said that, Saudi Arabia just made a major military purchase  from the United States, they are a key actor, if you will, a key check on  Iran and other countries in the region who have been aberrant lately.  So  we've got to have a reasoned response.</p><p>And I think President Trump has handled this perfectly.  He's looking at  it.  He's concerned about it.  He's condemned it.  But he's going to make  sure that the punishment fits the crime.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in the midterms -- Congressman, in terms  of how this plays out, 15 days away?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I'm optimistic.  Let's face it.  The Senate is trending up  very well in our great state of Tennessee.  Marsha Blackburn in a key state  is going to do very well.  I think she's going to win.  Looking across the  map, the Senate's in very good shape.</p><p>A month ago I was extremely concerned about the House.  Those competitive  House seats, though, have moved much tighter.  It's gone very well.  I  think we're going to hold the House.  It's razor-thin.</p><p>But I think Independents are going to see that the Democratic Party has  really gone off the rails.  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, like the  Republican Party, used to at least play on the same field.  The Democrats  sadly have jettisoned so far to the left -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  -- that I think the American people need to cure this and I  think Independents will do that and come out and vote for Republicans.  My  prediction -- we will hold the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Rod Rosenstein under fire, what House Judiciary  Chairman Bob Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from the deputy  attorney general when he testifies on Wednesday.</p><p>Then steal a base, win a taco -- how you can win free food during the World  Series, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>An intense manhunt is underway this morning after a police officer is shot  and killed in Georgia.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well Maria -- one suspect is  already under arrest in the death of 30-year-old officer Antoine Tony.   Police say tony and other officers were responding to calls of a suspicious  vehicle.  When the officers found that car, shots were fired from inside  and one of those shots hit Tony.  Police are now searching for 18-year-old  Tafahree Maynard, wanted for murder.</p><p>Forty-two police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year.   That's already seven more than all of last year.</p><p>Well, U.S. national security advisor John Bolton is in Moscow this week for  what's expected to be some pretty tense talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin and other officials over U.S. plans to pull out of a nuclear  arms treaty.  The Kremlin says President Trump's decision is a cause for  deep concern.  It would make the world a more dangerous place.</p><p>Senator Rand Paul on \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" says withdrawing from the treaty is  a bad idea.  .</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple  of months ago.  And they still regard this, this reduction of nuclear arms  and the disaster that would be nuclear war.  I don't want to see another  nuclear arms race with Russia or with any other country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the U.S. claims that Russia has violated the agreement which  forbids the use of intermediate and short range rockets.  The Kremlin  adding the U.S. has not formally communicated its intentions to leave the  treaty to Russia.</p><p>And then there is this.  Papa John's founder, John Schnatter requesting the  company, amend its poison pill plan.  Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in  the company but he's prohibited from buying more stock until July of 2019  under a poison pill plan put in place by the board of directors.  Well  Schnatter was ousted, you may remember as chairman back in July after  racially-charged comments he made on a conference call leaked out to the  press.</p><p>Here's the stock.  Shares of Papa John's are down about 7 percent so far  this year.  And Maria -- as you can see on the chart, the pressure has been  on that stock as Schnatter's troubles have increased.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.</p><p>All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a shakeup at CBS, the details as interim chairman, Richard  Parsons, is stepping down from the board now just a few weeks after  entering.</p><p>Then Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings -- we break down  those numbers.  As you can see, Hasbro now down 9 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are higher ahead of the open this morning.  Investors are bracing  for the biggest week of third quarter earnings yet this week.</p><p>Dow Industrials up better than 90 points ahead of all of these earnings  coming out, a third of a percent.  We've got big names like Amazon,  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet -- all set to report.  Those are Nasdaq  companies.  And the Nasdaq is up this morning as you see all the numbers  coming out from a number of companies -- Caterpillar, McDonald's, also  market movers there.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about that is Wells Fargo senior global equity  strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- it's good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us this morning.</p><p>What are your expectations for earnings and heading into the earnings  season, is it priced in to markets?  </p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Well, Maria --  good morning.</p><p>And I think what really people want to know, what the market wants to know  is -- we know these earnings are going to be good overall -- 20 percent,  maybe a little bit more than that.  But I think what the market really  wants to hear about is what's going to happen in 2019 because clearly  earnings growth in 2019 is going to be nowhere near what it is this year.</p><p>And then of course, you know, what's the cost?  What are these tariffs  doing to costs?  Is there wage pressure?  Anything that affects margins.   So I think that's what's really more important than the absolute results  because, you know, we know they're going to be good results.  </p><p>KELLY:  Scott -- it's pretty interesting what's happening in the market  right now and that's obviously the dislocations seem to be about one of  those costs and that's the rising cost of capital, right, going up.</p><p>But to me, it doesn't seem like the Fed is really, you know, making a  mistake here, given that inflation's up about 2.5 percent over the last 12  months but their Fed funds rate is still below that, so it's negative on  real terms.</p><p>Where do you see the Fed going next year?  Where do you see rates going?   And how is that going to impact where the market goes for the next year?   Because it seems if we're only up 4 percent so far this year, could we have  another year next year where it's only up a couple percent?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think, you know, as far as our fixed income group, they're  looking for a hike in December which I think the Fed is certainly directing  the market toward that.  They're also looking for three more next year, so  basically between now and the end of 2019, looking for four more hikes.</p><p>From an equity strategy point of view, we think that that -- you know,  that's really -- you're kind of at the red line and I think the market is  going to be very sensitive to any hint or conversation or enthusiasm out of  Jay Powell that, you know, hey, we might increase the pace here, which I  think would -- the market would not take very well.</p><p>Now, as far as the S&amp;P 500 right now, at least based on our analysis,  stocks are pretty close to fair value.  Our year-end target has been 2800  to 2900.  We're just a touch below there.  And I think probably over the  course of the next 12 months or so, you could see the S&amp;P 500 -- let's call  it 8 percent higher than where we are now.</p><p>So even though we think stocks are pretty fairly valued right now, still  think there's some upside here, still think the bull market is not over.   We still want to lean towards those sectors that are sensitive to a  continuation of the recovery.  We don't want our clients hiding right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott-- it's Dagen McDowell.  What do you make of the \"Wall  Street Journal\" highlights slowing sales growth and how that's a major head  wind for the markets?  Noting that third quarter sales are expected to be  up 7.3 percent from the same period last year, this is for the S&amp;P 500.   But that is the lowest rate for the S&amp;P in four quarters. </p><p>And Lindsey Bell has been on this program and voiced her concerns as well  about that.  </p><p>WREN:  You know, Dagen-- last quarter I have to say we were looking for  about -- in the second quarter we were looking for about 8 percent growth  and it came in close to 10 percent.  So our number for this third quarter  reporting season was 8 percent and we're a touch below that.</p><p>So, you know, I would consider really anything, you know, at this point in  the cycle, anything you know, 6 to 8 percent maybe 9 -- 6 to 9 percent  earnings growth or revenue growth, rather, I think that's good.  And I  think next year you'll probably see something at the lower end of that  range.</p><p>But I think that's what the market expects.  It's probably priced in and  really, you know, 7 percent or 8 percent earnings growth in the third  quarter I don't really think that's going to bother investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would put new money to work right here then, Scott?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely -- Maria.  You know, we're going to open this morning  basically sitting right on the 200 day moving average.  And we closed below  it a time or two over the last couple of weeks.  But right now I think  you're at a point where if you have money on the sidelines, you need to  start legging in.  And if we trade a little bit lower here, you should  continue to do that.</p><p>So if you have a certain amount of money, you know, at these levels, put a  third of it in and if we go a little bit lower, step in with another third  because if you think as I do that a trade war is unlikely, that we're going  to continue to see decent international growth that's based on what our  economists are looking at, we're going to see decent growth here in the  U.S., then the forward fundamentals look pretty good.  And we want our  clients stepping in here and getting exposure if they have cash on the  sidelines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Scott -- we'll be watching.  Thanks so much.  Scott  Wren -- </p><p>WREN:  All right.  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us there from Wells Fargo.</p><p>Coming up, a college party turns into a nightmare -- The latest  developments after the floor collapses, injuring at least 30 people.</p><p>Then, demanding answers, what House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte told me he's expecting to hear from Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein this upcoming Wednesday when Rosenstein testifies.

Take a look, markets are at  the highs right now, Dow Industrials set to open up about 100 points this  morning, that's almost one half of one percent higher.  NASDAQ is up three- quarters of a percent right now, that's the high of the morning, up 54  points on the NASDAQ.  And the S&amp;P is off third of a percent, 10 points  higher.  </p><p>This after a mixed day on Friday for the major indices at the close.  The  DowIndustrials were up 65 points, a quarter of a percent.  But the NASDAQ  was lower and the S&amp;P was also down one point on the S&amp;P lower.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look, markets are seeing some gains here as  well.

The interview will be closed --  will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will be  transcribed.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte telling me  yesterday in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" what  investigators are looking for specifically.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We want to  know in particular about the new developments that we've been made aware of  about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees  and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the  president of the United States.  His boss, the chief executive officer of  our country.  </p><p>And the possibility of pulling together cabinet members to invoke the 25th  Amendment to the United States constitution which would be a mechanism to  declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice  president presumably serving in his place.  </p><p>These are very, very serious allegations.  We have all of this based upon a  newspaper report and we have third party testimony that we've heard in our  investigation.  We know he's met with President Trump.  President Trump has  been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two  at the Department of Justice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOODLATTE:  But the Congress has oversight responsibility so we're going to  ask him about those questions along with many other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial an analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  You only --  good morning.  You almost can't make this up really when you -- when you  think about it.  The people that Congressman Goodlatte's folks have  interviewed were not in the room when deputy attorney general Rosenstein  said this.  He doesn't seem to be much of as it be whether or not he said  it.  He says it was sarcastic.  Three people in the room say it was  sarcastic.  One person in the room, Andrew McCabe, fired from the FBI for  lying, said I interpret it seriously.  </p><p>The president either isn't worried about it or is biding his time until  after the midterm elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's more that's going to be on the -- on the  table obviously on Wednesday with Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goodlatte is also looking to get to the bottom of what was said  to the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When they actually applied for a warrant to wiretap someone who  worked with the Trump campaign which of course is Carter Page.  And what  we've heard now from John Ratcliffe as well as Congressman Goodlatte is  that the Obama administration officials withheld information to the FISA  court in order to get that warrant.  Here's Bob Goodlatte on that issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  There's a lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements  and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that.  He came into this matter at  the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal  of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court in  secret to approve a wiretap on an individual, who's a United States citizen  and this went on for a full year.  The last three months of which Mr.  Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.  So we have questions for  him about that and we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, judge?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, I've been a very harsh critic for FISA for a  long time.  In my view, it is a corrupt way for the Justice Department to  use the lower FISA standard, probable cause of communicating with a foreign  person as opposed to the higher constitutional standard, you get a warrant,  probable cause of crime, in order to get the camel's nose under the tent.   In order to start listening to what someone is saying because they don't  have probable cause of crime but they do have probable cause of talking to  a foreign person.  Carter Page hasn't been charged with anything.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They served failed every conceivable thing about him for a  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was such -- he was such an enemy of the state, you would  have seen charges by now.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why the story outrages me.  And you know, the fact, what  John Ratcliffe told us is that when you have two pieces of information, you  have one thing from the unverified dossier to present to the FISA court,  then you have another piece of information that completely refutes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It refutes anything that Trump had anything to do with Russia  collusion, but they didn't present that to the FISA court.  They held that  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think -- I think you and I talked, maybe it was last week  about an experience I had on the bench where I learned that when  investigators came to me for an emergency search warrant which I signed.   They did not tell me what they also knew about it.  Years later, trying the  case, I said how did you get this -- how did you get this search warrant?   Did you tell the judge about this?  Not realizing that it was me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And I threw the charges out.  </p><p>So, the consequences of misbehavior by agents of the executive branch,  whether at the state level where I was or the federal level which is what  we're talking about, by not telling everything to the court can be  catastrophic for whatever they are trying to accomplish.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's Maria's issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are on the story like no one else, not just in T.V. but in  the media in general.  Because it falls by the wayside as people move on to  like out -- the outrage at the moment.  This is outrageous.  Because there  aren't any consequences.  Will anybody ever pay for doing this?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- who knows?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's put this in context of where we are, ia presidential  election year, the year is 2016.  You had one team wanting to spy on the  other team.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You had Hillary's team and the Obama administration saying you  know what, let's spy on Trump.  Let's do this.  And then, they get the  warrant to do so.  It's wrong.  It's disgusting.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two aspects here that we haven't talked about and that  is when the president of the United States said I'm going to release all  this FISA stuff, I haven't seen it but my people -- but my people have seen  it.  Who went to him and begged him not to?  British intelligence and  Israeli intelligence, which tells you their fingerprints are on it.  Which  tells you that through Jack Brennan the Obama administration was more  likely than not using foreign intelligence to commence its surveillance of  then candidate Trump and the people are watching them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they were just trying to do whatever they could to spy on  the political enemy.  It's as simple as that.  They wanted to spy on their  political enemy.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yet again, but it was also Susan  Rice didn't have -- she used surveillance, right?  She put in for the  application.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then unmasked everybody.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one -- I don't know this to be so.</p><p>KELLY:  This is getting back (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  She is probably the one that got this information to the  Washington Post.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And then they leaked it.  The strategy was  incredible.  </p><p>First, come up with this narrative, that Trump had anything to do with  Russia meddling.  Then, leak it to the media, let it -- get it into the  site guys.  Then, get informants to lure Trump people and say, Donald  Junior, let's go do a meeting, I've got this informant.  They're all  informants.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are some very angry Republicans about what Congressman  Goodlatte told you yesterday and who are they?  Republicans on the  committee that are not permitted to participate in this interrogation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan say Rosenstein's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Precisely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- writing the rules for his own testimony because it was Rod  Rosenstein who said, you know what, we want two Republicans and two  Democrats in the room.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, when that happens and when it is recorded -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  on Wednesday.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  And then goes to the Intelligence Committee to  whitewash any classified material.  Then Republicans will leak their  version and Democrats will leak their version.  Yet again, instead of  letting the American people see that what the people we sent to Washington  to work for us are doing -- excuse me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  With the power we gave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-word fixes that, declassify.  And President needs --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They talked the -- they talked the president out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  The president needs to declassify these  documents so the American people can understand what went on here.  Is this  going to have a factor in the midterm?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  When and when and if it comes out, I think  it will be too late.  I don't -- I don't think this can -- this can come  out in the next two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham also had a lot to say about this and he's going  to be doing a 13 city tour.  He's now, you know, looked at by the  Republican as the guy to sell their colleagues.  Your thoughts on that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, he became very popular when in the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  After Kavanaugh.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- in the midst of the Kavanaugh hearings, enough was enough,  I'm tired of this prosecutor from Arizona asking the questions, I'm tired  of what the Democrats are doing.  I'm going to take charge here and he did.   He lost his temper, or at least, it appeared that he did.  But he  galvanized a lot of the Republican base as well as all the Republicans on  the committee.  And pretty much chasing the Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because people felt like he was -- he was speaking for them.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody who was on the right felt the same way that Lindsey  Graham did.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think they're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Watching these hearings.  So, whether -- and he just spoke from  his heart.  I mean, being a very blunt, passionate southerner.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I recognize that kind of behavior.  He's like enough is enough.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Are you a one passionate southerner?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm probably more prone to expletives than the senator.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  McKenzie, do we have the sound bite of Lindsey Graham?  I want  to tell you what Lindsey Graham said about the midterm elections and  specifically this investigation.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The FBI investigation.  He's expecting to be the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham is.  Here's Lindsey Graham  with me yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, the House promises to  impeach the president and Kavanaugh.  I think the Republicans will continue  to try to hold the FBI and Department of Justice accountable for abuse of  power.  </p><p>If I'm the chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year, we hold the  Senate.  I promise you we're going to find out about the Simpson -- Fusion  GPS problem.  I promise you, we're going to get to the bottom of how they  used a dossier, prepared by foreign agents, paid for by the Democratic  Party to get a warrant against an American citizen.  We're not going to  turn our back on this.</p><p>If I'm chairman, we're going to get to the bottom of this.  And the only  way for me to be chairman is for us to hold the Senate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if the Republicans hold the senate, as seems likely, if  the Democrats take the House which this morning seems likely, the two  chairs of the Judiciary Committee couldn't be more opposite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Jerry Nadler.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And all the stuff that Congressman Goodlatte wants to come  out, the Democrats take the House, we'll never see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It goes away.  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Another consequence of this midterm election.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, great to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know I was kidding, McD.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know you were -- of course you were -- not really, actually.   Expletive, expletive, expletive.  You're lucky I didn't say -- you know  what, if I was really mad, I'd say --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I want to hear you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  coming up, major changes at CBS to tell you about, the details  as interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning from the company's board,  that's next.</p><p>And then a brawl on the basketball court, why three players and the lead  singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were ejected.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Get this, a college party turned into a  nightmare.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl, what a story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  These poor kids, Maria.  About  30 people sent to the hospital after a floor suddenly gave way beneath them  during a party near the campus of Clemson University.  This happened in  South Carolina.  The whole thing captured on a party-goers iPhone.  </p><p>Yes, well, a witness says people were jumping to a popular song when the  floor just caved in.  Clemson said the police said none of the injuries are  luckily, life-threatening.  </p><p>Well, the interim chairman of CBS resigned after a month on the job due to  health issues.  Richard Parsons is stepping down after his doctors told him  to reduce his workload so he can deal with complications from multiple  myeloma.  Strauss Zelnick, another new board member is going to take over  for Parsons.  Shares of CBS are down three percent so far this year.  </p><p>Then there is this, guys, Senator Elizabeth Warren defending her decision  to take a DNA test to prove she is indeed part Native American.  So, at a  debate yesterday for her Senate seat, Warren said that she did it to,  quote:  Rebuild trust in the government through transparency.  </p><p>In March, Warren had said that no DNA test was needed to prove her claim  but she said she ultimately took the test which showed a relative six to 10  generations ago was indeed Native American.  And we played the ad for our  viewers last week, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what was -- what was that, one, 1000.  </p><p>CASONE:  Six to 10 generations.  Six grandparents ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the -- at the -- at the least, she is one, 1,024th native  American, which would put here at a lower percentage than the average  European-American in terms of the percentage of their background that is  Native American.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we still talking about this?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because she can't shut up about it.</p><p>KELLY:  Because Democrats --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She thinks the more she talks about it, she's somehow going to  be right.  Number one, she caved in to President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number one.  Number two, Harvard law school was presenting her  as their first woman of color.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In print.  Harvard law spokesman -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, she did gain them -- she gained from lying.  </p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  This is --  this is why it mattered.  As she was technically their minority person on  their faculty.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HIGGINS:  And so she deliberately traded on this part of status of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You know, which is not knowing that it was in any way true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Are you a Taco Bell fan?  We will tell you how you  can score a free taco during the World Series, next.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are seven weeks into the NFL season.  The standings are  beginning to take shape.  Jared Max said the Chiefs are on top in the AFC.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Maria, the AFC really  looks like a two-team race between the Chiefs and the Patriots.  </p><p>One week after New England handed Kansas City its first loss, on the last  second field goal, Kansas City barbecued the Bengals, 45-10.   PatrickMahomes, four more touchdown passes, the Chiefs goes to 6-1, 45-10.  </p><p>Because of a snap penalty against Dallas, the Cowboy's 47-yard potential  game tying field goal became a 52-yarder.  Would have been good for 47, but  the Redskins win.  First place Redskins beat the Cowboys 20-17.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Losers, the Cowboys.  Losers.  Continue, Jared.  </p><p>MAX:  The Carolina Panthers -- the Carolina Panthers came back from 17 down  to beat the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles by three.  Panthers' Eric  Reid earlier had to be restrained before the opening coin toss.  Reid went  after the Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins and other players.  </p><p>Now, last year Jenkins co-founded the NFL players coalition to work with  the league on social justice issues.  Now, Jenkins no longer kneels for the  anthem.  Reid does.  And he thinks Jenkins is a sellout.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC REID, SAFETY, PANTHERS:  I believe Malcolm capitalized on the  situation.  He co-opted the movement that was started by Collin to get his  organization funding.  It's cowardly.  He sold us out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Sold them out, wow.  </p><p>And football, we have feistiness and also in the NBA.  After Saturday's  Lakers, Rockets game, became fight night at L.A. at the NBA, suspends three  players total of nine games without pay.  Chris Paul of the Rockets, two  games suspended.  He poked Rajon Rondo in the eye.  Rondo started to punch  Paul.  He got three games, one more than Paul, because he threw the first  punch and appears to have spit right at Chris Paul.  Now, this instigated  the fight.  Rondo throws a several punches and the Lakers Brandon Ingram  gets four games.  Wow.  </p><p>World Series begins tomorrow night on Fox at Fenway Park.  The Red Sox  favored to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Chris Sale will be Boston's game  one starter, likely Clayton Kershaw for L.A.  </p><p>World Series provisionally Taco Bell will give out free Doritos tacos --  free Doritos Locos Tacos, got to go crazy, for four hours on November 1st,  all we have to see is a base get stolen in the World Series and the free  Doritos Locos Tacos is yours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, bring on the Locos Tacos.  </p><p>MAX:  Two quiero, Taco Bell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday, it is  Monday, October 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this  morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now.  Dow Industrials set  to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P is also up a half percent.  Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right  now, up one percent.  This is the high of the morning across the board.   This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure.  The Dow  snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&amp;P and  the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday.  In Europe this  morning, the trend continues upside.  Markets are higher.  FT-100 up almost  a percent, 59 points higher.</p><p>CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher.  And the DAX  Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher.  In  Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout.   Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government  revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.  </p><p>Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi  Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action  against the kingdom.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an  exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  These are  very, very serious allegations.  We know he's met with President Trump.   President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue  on as his number two at the Department of Justice.  But the Congress has  oversight responsibilities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court  as well.  Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so  far.  10 Dow components due to report their earnings.  Plus technology  giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets.  They're coming out  this week as well.  On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third  quarter.  Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.</p><p>We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter.  All those  stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin  Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins.  Good to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE:   Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  It's great to see the markets  are up actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of  tempered a little bit.  The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their  markets.  So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings  especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit  margins than any other sector in the S&amp;P 500.  So with those earnings  coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate  in the cloud.</p><p>So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin.  Their  cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit  margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent  operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Microsoft had a good quarter.  </p><p>KELLY:  And they pay great dividend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what though, we were expecting from the  beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year.  I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight  percent or something for the third quarter.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  In the earnings so  far we've only had 17 percent of the S&amp;P report so far, but earnings are up  more than 25 percent --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>METAXAS:  -- so far this quarter.  And the trouble spot is that revenue is  growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue  estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in  terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was  reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right?  And  then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings  recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth.  Look at what this economy  is doing.  If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it,  I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25  percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking  for any impact of these tariffs.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the second quarter.</p><p>HIGGINS:  We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture  sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is  actually occurring.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>HIGGINS:  You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable  lows particularly for blacks and others.  It's -- it levels it has never  been at.  You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar  workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good backdrop.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in  the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some  comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still  the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to  hold the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We want to get to get to all of that coming  up.  And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week.   The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting.  It will  be transcribed.  This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells  me in an exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES\".</p><p>He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the  Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOODLATTE:  A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we  want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the  later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the  FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to  approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this  went on for a full year.</p><p>The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval  of that.  So we have questions for him about that.  And we will be sure to  ask plenty of questions regarding it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor  and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent.  Byron, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this --  the Washington Examiner titled, \"The End Could Be Near for House  Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators.\"  And in it, you outlined the  revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work  of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his  colleagues.  Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.</p><p>And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a  couple weeks.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, it does go away if Democrats win.  I think there is no doubt  about that.  On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's  controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim  Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset  because one, they're not going to be there.</p><p>And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified  setting.  Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few  people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will  be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats.  Just four guys  and a court reporter and that's it.  And it's going to be conducted in a  skiff and a classified setting.</p><p>And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about  wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to  other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President,  is that somehow classified?  No, that is a matter of the highest public  interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made  public as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do  they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations.  Should the Democrats  take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B.  For  example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report  coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out  there so that there could be accountability.</p><p>And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate he will continue these investigations.  So we'll see, but I  agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they  have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't  want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in  small group of people top of the FBI.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to  investigate the Trump-Russia matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is  doing that.  The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing  that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this  case.  And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not  know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.</p><p>We know about the role that the dossier played.  We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans.  We know that the dossier was used  in a very questionable FISA warrant.  We know that FBI agents did not think  Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on.  And we only know  those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking  into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and  Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the  Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President.  They  want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns.   Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct  of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is  pretty much over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And those will be the chairman that you mentioned,  they're not certain yet.</p><p>YORK:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would.  Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi  Arabia.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending  his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at  reinforcing ties at a critical moment.  This comes as Saudi King Salman and  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post  columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.</p><p>The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and  the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there  were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?  </p><p>ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA:  There once  people closely tied to him were involved in this operation.  This was an  operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals  ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  It's ridiculous to believe that  18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the  government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority.  He was  clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi  Arabia without people at the top knowing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Byron, where does this go?  I mean, it's pretty clear the  King is keeping his son in power.  He gave him more authority to reorganize  the intelligence community.  What do you think?  Will the Crown Prince have  to step down?  </p><p>YORK:  Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S.  punitive action against Saudi Arabia.  I mean. this is a complex story and  there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk  action in this.  This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a  foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another  foreign country in a not very transparent one.</p><p>We're trying to find out what happens.  The President has said that there  will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder  Khashoggi.  And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he  is being lied to in all this.  He is making a lot of comments that are  actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with  action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.</p><p>Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that  is negative to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because you have to do something but then again there are  only hope against Iran, right?  I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia  you talk about Iran.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  Oh, yes.  And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911,  funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen.  So  we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is  figuring out what actually is punitive to them.  Ending trade deals or arms  deals does not do that.  But for example, insisting that they expand oil  production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be  punitive, would be beneficial -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they have spoken about that.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  No.  We have no idea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If something -- </p><p>HIGGINS:  If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine,  something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be  it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Byron, on the border battle.  The migrant caravan  from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now  despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border.   Where does this go?  </p><p>YORK:  Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it  grow when it gets to the United States border?  Does it even get to the  United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the  President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons.  The  first and most important is the substance of the thing.  If a large number  of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in  the precedent that sets.</p><p>The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is  very, very bad for the United States.  The other reason for the President  is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is  an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters.  And for the  President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These pictures are incredible.  Byron, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Byron Work, Washington Examiner.  Coming up.  All eyes on  earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so  far.  We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies  coming up next.  </p><p>And then from cars to drones.  Uber rolls out a timeline for the food  delivery service via drones.  All the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are sure in countdown to the midterm  elections.  15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama  are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the  November contentious election.  Blake Burman is live at the White House  this morning with more on that.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  They say politics can make strange bedfellows and  will get yet another example later today.  You remember it was just a  couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted.  Cruz  fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial  philanderer.  Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will  head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with  Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin.  However  O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone.  Then later today as well,  we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to  Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend.  The 44th  President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th  President will head on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of  Illinois this week.  This was part of President Trump's message over the  weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to massively  raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela.   They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and  I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment  taken away.  Not a big point.  That's not a good sound bite.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the  newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans  are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in  the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72  percent for Democrats.  By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for  President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that  Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll. </p><p>However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting  him underwater.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>HIGGINS:  His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it's going it's going in his direction?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes, those are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  From the streets to the skies, Uber  lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone.  Got those  details next.  And then new FICO score could soon get a boost.  Details on  the new changes set to take effect.  The new scoring system we've got them  here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A big week ahead.  Lots of corporate earnings  and big economic news.  Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange this morning with details there.  Deidre, good morning.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That is right.  Good morning,  Maria.  So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a  third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week.  I'm  going to go through the list.  3M, McDonald's, United Technologies,  Caterpillar and Verizon.  And then as far as the S&amp;P 500 companies go, it  would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.</p><p>So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday.  Just to let  you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded  expectancies.  So, so far so good.  We've heard from varying industries,  one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning.   Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.</p><p>We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down  even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia.  So Halliburton, a  special focal point this morning, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Deidre.  Thanks very much.  We could see a rally of  about 100 right out of the gate.  Deidre will follow that.  A group of  Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica.  Cheryl Casone  with the details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened  over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a  Costa Rican guide in the Central American country.  The victims were  carried away downstream after their raft flipped over.  Other people in  other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by  another guy that was in a kayak as well.</p><p>The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor  party.  They were all from the Miami area we should say.  Authorities say  that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the  river.  That's where it happened.  </p><p>Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year.  FICO is  going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you  manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market  account.  Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts  don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise.  The Ultra FICO score  has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal  loans.  </p><p>And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones.  According  to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive  to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial  operations by 2021.  However, Uber took the job posting down after an  inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying \"it does not fully reflect our  program which is still in very early days.\"</p><p>OK.  The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year.  Bankers  say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria.  At least with  the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer.  There is a positive --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  A crude  awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are  coming onboard.  We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.</p><p>Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal  exit of Britain from the E.U.  U.K. Secretary of State for International  Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd.  Your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are rallying  this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110  points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the  industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter  earnings.  The S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one  percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ. </p><p>European trading similar story.  Take a look at the markets in Europe right  now.  The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher.   The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher.  Asian markets  closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board.  Best performer,  look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong  Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent. </p><p>The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks  away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran.  Why one big name is  saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel  on crude right now.  </p><p>All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an  hour targeting trade.  The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a  deal.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been  unsatisfactory, his word not mine.  The U.S. and the U.K. also working to  secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European  Union.  There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and  the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that  meeting.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for  International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade.  It is good to  see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Nice to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's --  what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize  our access to the E.U.  market and make an access there to the U.K. market,  but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of  the world.  The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10  to 15 years will be outside continental Europe.  We obviously have to be  free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement  with the E.U. after we leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's,  like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to  have an independent trade policy.  It's one of the main reasons that I  campaigned and voted to leave.  But we also have, other areas of contention  too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated  differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland.  We want to  ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax  harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we  ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition  period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?  </p><p>FOX:  Access to the world's fifth biggest market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  </p><p>FOX:  And Germany's biggest trading partner.  And we will be the biggest  trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the  European Union when we leave.  So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to  trade or investment that don't exist today.  Why would we want to see  tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this  stance, right?  Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are  wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U.  Theresa May, is she  committed?</p><p>FOX:  We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year.  The question  is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like?  And  as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95  percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it very, very well -- very articulate.  You're hosting  International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties  between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that.  What do you want to see  with U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S.  And it's our biggest  single export market as a country.  We have a trillion dollars invested in  one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K.  companies and vice versa every day.  So, it's very important that we look  at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions,  what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs?   How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues  that we're discussing today?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S.   I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically  the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs  and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move  forward.  This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter,  we're second.  If we can get liberalization there, fantastic.  If can get a  move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would  be ground breaking globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening  already for financial services companies?  I mean, you know that businesses  need certainty.  And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this  would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of  their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out.  I mean, the  exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial  services companies.  Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal  is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you  already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?  </p><p>FOX:  No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How?  </p><p>FOX:  Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination  for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which  even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase  in the U.K.  It was remarkable.  London is still the number one  metropolitan destination of the world for investment.  And last year, in  venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than  the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together.  So,  investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying  economic fundamentals in the U.K.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting and you make good point about the services  part this.  This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance,  and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set  the rules around global services?  This our time.  This is the time, when  we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing  back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing  intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology.  I mean, the  President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing  back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end  subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private,  all that analysis we share.  Of course, we don't share the two-three-two  mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K.  we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York  Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military.  And yet, we're not  having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we  disagree with, not the analysis.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do  close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, they are sanctions on the European Union.  So, when we leave  the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States --  that becomes bilateral.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But has that been one of the talking points, has that been  among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral  deal with U.S.  Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away  on steel, right?  </p><p>FOX:  We won't want that, but, of course -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But have they indicated they would? </p><p>FOX:  And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're  members of the European Union under E.U. law.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK, so that's the sticking point.  When would you  expect all of these deals to take place?  You say the U.K. is going to be  exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade  deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll  obviously have that relationship in place.  For the United States, we  finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements.   The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no  taxes on any imports and exports.  Is that something that you've discussed?  </p><p>FOX:  That would be a wonderful place to be.  Why would we have any costs  for our consumers that we didn't have to have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about  it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the  U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.  </p><p>FOX:  Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the  automobiles.  But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K.  light trucks, we'd like to see that go.  That is not just tariff, of  course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an  escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade.  Back in 2010, we were  operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating  1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of  U.K.-U.S. deal going forward?  What should we be watching?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that  will be the end of March next year.  And at that point, we'll both set out  what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another.  We are in  favor of general liberalization of trade.  The U.K. is a very free trade in  country.  We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U.  couldn't do, for example, on data movement.  The E.U. has got restrictions  on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we  got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must  determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't.  One of three  reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our  money, control of our laws and control of our borders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of  the European economy in all of this?  Has it been uncertainty of it?  Or  how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?  </p><p>FOX:  See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in  exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for  investments in the world, and the top in Europe.  And unemployment rate  just dropping below four percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in  the U.K.?  </p><p>FOX:  The reason why investors are still coming is that economic  fundamentals are strong.  There are a number of people who've never really  come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our  economy is performing so strongly.  They told us that we'd see a half a  million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the  referendum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess.  Let me ask you about  Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>FOX:  Fake prediction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fake prediction.  You recently pulled out of the Future  Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do  that including, Fox.  Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s  relationship with the kingdom?  What do you want to see in terms of the  Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?  </p><p>FOX:  We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible  investigation.  We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government  overnight about how this event happened.  We want to verify that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you  look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities  for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?  </p><p>FOX:  Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and  future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports.  But we want to make  sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely  with us, the United States, being the top.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, it's all about trade.  In terms of -- </p><p>FOX:  In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security.   How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity  under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political  stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security.  So, let's  make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate.   But of course, we have to generate it first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much.  We'll be watching your international day of trade today.  Liam Fox  there.</p><p>News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he  says this: \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to  stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States.   Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.  I have alerted  Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency.  Must change  laws!\"  That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed  to the border of the U.S.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, we're watching oil.  Brent  rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00  and change, what's driving this market.  Then, 15 days until midterm  elections.  The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart  Varney on that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The economy under President Trump, the  President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections  according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll.  Joining me now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Did you  see those jobs numbers?  They come right from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular.  That may account for the  rise in the President's approval rating.  In Florida, in the last 12  months, they've added 407,000 new jobs.  In Texas, they've added 406,000  new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history  for those two states.  In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years.  In  Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.  </p><p>I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a  surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a  polling moving towards the President and the GOP.  You just put up on the  screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll,  that's right up there.  That's actually a little better than the  performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same  time in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which  were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the  Republicans.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather  made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at  this point in the cycle.  But will voters vote on that, Stu?  Are they  going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely  changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else?   I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I think this caravan that's  heading our way --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is a new issue in this election.  And I think it's very  favorable towards President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them,  essentially, that's the two points of view here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and,  yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show.  We're  going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" has it all on both  counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the  looming Iran sanctions.  They're going to hit in the next two weeks.  Oil  now just below $80.00 a barrel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeted this: \"Every time  you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our  country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the  votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\"  The President goes on to  say, \"Remember the midterms.  So unfair to those who come in legally.\"   \"Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to  come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not  giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws.\" he writes,  \"remember the midterms.  Unfair to those who come in legally,\" writes the  President.</p><p>I want to take a closer look at oil this morning.  Oil has been creeping  up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet  Oil just under 70 this morning.  We are now two weeks away from  implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports.  Meanwhile, a recent  report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks.   Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork.  Stephen, good  to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Great to be here.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks.  Your view.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria.  We've had a summer  where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at  an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've  ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas  was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer,  again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by  August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was  clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals.   Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20  percent rise in oil.  </p><p>Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front  month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or  November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the  Iranian sanctions go into effect.  The November contract today in WTI  expires today.  The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the  month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCHORK:  We've had five months to digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian  news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative  bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s.  We're now correcting that bubble and  now we're in the high 60s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's Heather.</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  So, my question is there was some internal report that was  released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production,  and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American,  United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that  in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC  supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the  Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated  for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran.  That's  not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident  that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing  us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going  lower.  We will check back.</p><p>SCHORK:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen Schork joining us there.  We've got final thoughts when  we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  You heard it from Dagen McDowell.  Seize the  day!  Right to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" we go.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day?  Seize the new week, why not?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, everyone.  It's going to be a very big week for --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Their view has gained steam in recent weeks as technology companies and their platforms, products and services are being heavily depended upon by those staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not all are on board with their view.</p><p>Tech performance during the coronavirus might prompt rethinking whether \"techlash\" against the industry, partly fueled by concerns about the size of some tech companies and by privacy concerns (see 1908190021), is justified, according to participants in a TechFreedom podcast.</p><p>\"We're all in a period of rethinking tech and tech policy,\" Technology Policy Institute President Scott Wallsten said on the podcast,released Wednesday. Before COVID-19, \"sentiment had sort of turned very negative against tech,\" he added. But the crisis \"is reminding us of all of the things that tech does well,\" the economist said. \"Once this is over, I think there is going to be a resetting of lots of people's beliefs.\" Podcast host and TechFreedom Director-Civil Liberties Ashkhen Kazaryan said he hopes \"that after we pass through the pandemic, and hopefully with as little damage as we can, everyone can reassess\" techlash. She suggested a \"start from a very neutral, unbiased place again.\"</p><p>It \"remains to be seen\" if the industry can surmount techlash, but tech and broadband companies \"have reminded people about all the reasons we like innovation,\" Wallsten emailed us, and \"that those companies have been crucial to promoting innovation. That had gotten lost in the techlash debate.\" He said such debates \"will change to focus more on inequalities that prevent everyone from benefiting.\" Privacy debates will be \"more precise, focusing on different types of data and how the costs and benefits of data sharing and availability differ by type of data and use,\" he said.</p><p>TPI Senior Fellow Sarah Oh, also interviewed on the podcast, told us later that \"COVID-19 has revealed the benefits of economies of scale in larger tech firms in capacity, privacy, and security.\" So, she emailed, \"techlash against big firms seems like a secondary concern.\"</p><p>Companies and their tech are doing \"incredible work fighting the coronavirus,\" emailed Kazaryan. \"Hopefully it reestablishes some good faith in technology and tech companies. I'm not calling for a hall pass, I'm asking for everyone to come to the table when this is over and have an open mind and a transparent conversation about the future of technology regulation.\"</p><p>However, \"Big Tech tales that the Coronavirus Crisis somehow will mitigate their Techlash problem,\" wrote Precursor President Scott Cleland, \"totally miss the mark.\" Such a view doesn't understand \"that the crisis is not good and not about tech,\" he wrote March 27. \"They miss that to whom much is given, much is expected.\"</p><p>The industry's view that its benefits absolve it from regulatory and other accountability is \"delusional,\" Cleland told us. \"This is how the internet platforms view the world, that they are special.\" Cleland's comments, which he said were his personal views, weren't in response to what the podcast participants said specifically but to the anti-techlash view generally. He summarized this as \"kind of this herd belief among the internet platforms that if they do good, they get away with anything bad.\" Cleland was president of ISP group Netcompetition, which he noted stopped operations Dec. 31, 2018.</p><p>Other groups with tech-industry concerns including Open Markets Institute didn't comment right away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN9-TXG1-JC8G-80KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 09, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Communications</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RO7</classCode><className>PODCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000214</classCode><className>BROADBAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The VC fund made the announcement today in a statement that it had taken a stake in the SA startup. It did not reveal what stake it had taken in the startup or what it had paid for the stake. The deal came about after the VC fund took ownership of SA VC fund Paper Plane Ventures[3]'s stake, after acquiring the SA VC fund. </p><p>Paper Plane Ventures, which was itself acquired by Platform Investment Partners in 2017, has a portfolio of six tech companies (see this story[4]) The portfolio includes Howler (see this story[5]) which announced earlier this year that it had netted investment in a round from the investor as well as other funders, and Aerobotics (see this story[6]). Centbee was founded in 2017 by co-CEOsLorien Gamaroff and Angus Brown. Gamaroff is a leading expert in blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, while Brown \u2014 the former CEO of eBucks.com \u2014 has 20 years' experience in payments and banking. Two Hop Ventures has acquired a stake in SA's Centbee after buying an existing investor In April last year Centbee announced that it had raised 1million in a Series-A round from Canadian-born billionaire entrepreneur Calvin Ayre (see this story[7]). Two Hop co-founder Jan Smit (pictured above, left with Centbee co-founder Angus Brown) commented in the same statement today, that: 'Not only is Centbee one of the most used wallets in the BitcoinSV (BSV) ecosystem, it's building products and services with a strong focus on regulatory compliance'. 'The senior management team come from strong professional and corporate backgrounds including software engineering, banking, payments, accounting and finance,' said Smit. Michael Stannard of Paper Plane Ventures said: 'We're proud to have supported Centbee from its early days as a small startup to becoming a formidable player in the crypto-asset space. We look forward to watching the fintech grow.' Brown, co-CEO of Centbee added that the deal 'demonstrates' the potential for Centbee and other BitcoinSV (BSV) companies to deliver real value for both investors, industry stakeholders and consumers. 'We've enjoyed a high user growth rate and have a clear path to revenue,' he added.

The NSPCC is backing Lord McNally's bill.</p><p>Andy Burrows, the NSPCC's head of child safety online, said: \"The Prime Minister must confirm plans to press ahead with a comprehensive Duty of Care, and urgently introduce an Online Harms Bill that will deliver a well-resourced regulator with the powers to take on big tech.</p><p>\"Anything less will let tech giants off the hook and have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of children, their families and law enforcement who are left to fight increasingly complex online child abuse day in and day out.\"</p><p>Labour has promised a \"non-partisan\" approach backing the introduction of a statutory duty of care. </p><p>\"This is a matter that demands cross-party, non-partisan collaboration. It is too important an area of our national life for it to become prey to the goings-on of party politics,\" said Lord Griffiths, Labour's culture spokesman in the Lords.</p><p>Lord McNally, a former leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, was digital minister in the Conservative-led coalition of 2010-15, and is treasurer of the Parliamentary Internet, Communications and Technology Forum.</p><p>He is drafting the bill with the Carnegie Trust, which originally proposed a duty of care for which The Daily Telegraph has campaigned over the past 18 months. Lord Puttnam and Baroness Kidron, the film director and children's internet rights campaigner are being canvassed as sponsors of the bill.</p><p>The Trust has proposed that Ofcom should be designated the regulator to avoid further delay that would result if a new independent internet watchdog had to be set up.</p><p>Its draft bill has proposed Ofcom would have powers to fine tech giants billions of pounds, mount raids to seize material and even order Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block their access to UK consumers if found guilty of serious breaches of the statutory duty of care.</p><p>Baroness Morgan who took over as Culture Secretary when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister is understood to be reviewing her predecessor's plans before publishing her proposals.</p><p>She has backed the principle of a duty of care and at the Conservatives' party conference signalled her support for a regulatory regime like the financial sector which would see tech bosses facing the same sanctions as bankers.</p><p>A Government spokesperson said: \"We are determined to tackle the evil of child sexual abuse, and the government has committed to legislating to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online.</p><p>\"We've set out world-leading proposals to put a duty of care on online companies, enforced by an independent regulator.

Correspondent</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Duty of Care laws should also protect the elderly from online fraud, an influential trust which backed the Telegraph campaign has said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Carnegie Trust UK, which first drew up the legal model for regulating tech giants, has written to the Culture Secretary Baroness Nicky Morgan saying social media giants should \"take responsibility\" for the \"explosion\" of consumer fraud on their sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The call comes as the trust published a draft bill setting out its vision for enforcing a duty of care, including making Ofcom the new regulator and arming with 'dawn raid' powers to seize data from tech firms' offices.</p><p>The Government announced in its October Queen's Speech that it planned to publish a draft duty of care bill next year for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>Yet, now the Conservatives have been returned with a strong majority, campaigners are watching to see what form the proposed bill will take in the new Queen's Speech tomorrow. </p><p>In the summer the Government published a white paper outlining how it planned to adopt duty of care to clamp down on online harms, following a yearlong campaign by the Daily Telegraph.</p><p>Its initial plans proposed creating a regulator to sanction tech giants if they failed to protect users from a wide range of harms, spanning terrorism to self-harm content.</p><p>Ministers said they are considering arming the regulator powers to levy fines running into the billions and even prosecute senior executives for serious breaches of their duty of care.</p><p>However, William Perrin, a trustee of Carnegie UK and former senior government advisor, said it was a \"strategic error\" not to include economic crime under the scope of duty of care.</p><p>Mr Perrin, who authored the first duty of care proposals with Lorna Woods, a professor of Law at Essex University, warned the issue would only become more salient with more older people now using social media.</p><p>He said: \"The online services targeted by the White Paper have allowed an explosion of consumer harms including the sale of illicit medicines and dangerous toys as well as fraud and phishing by failing to take systemic action. </p><p>\"A statutory duty of care should correct that, leading to the online space as a whole being a safe place in which businesses can operate and where consumers can have confidence that they will not be duped, scammed or misled. </p><p>\"The scale of online fraud is astonishing, the most prevalent crime in England and Wales-as more older and vulnerable people come online it's only fair that regulation should protect them.\"</p><p>The Carnegie Trust's draft bill called for Ofcom to be made the regulator, arguing it has the experience and reputation to take the job on immediately.</p><p>It also warned that tech giants should only be allowed to challenge the regulator's decisions by judicial review, saying otherwise it could be tangled up in endless appeals from wealthy tech companies.</p><p>The duty of care model has received wide support ranging from children's charities to medical bodies such as the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health to the Church of England. </p><p>Following the publication of the Carnegie Trust's draft bill, Andy Burrows, NSPCC Head of child safety online policy, said: \"For too long children have been at risk because big tech has argued that regulation is all but impossible, and they've been able to wash their hands of responsibility.</p><p>\"This Bill shows how readily the Government can introduce a regulatory framework that can hold social networks to account and protect young people from abuse. </p><p>\"It is vital that this new Government uses its power to urgently bring in a comprehensive Duty of Care regulator. Anything less than that would be insufficient and mean children and families, once again, are left to fend for themselves online.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58772169</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS8-5BH1-JCJY-G23B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

In the 1930s industrial economists viewed an uncompetitive industry as one in which a few firms had a large share of output and prices were high or quality low. Roll forward 80 years and competition regulators take refuge behind legal definitions of types of misconduct, such as price-fixing. If you ask them whether economy-wide dynamism has ebbed, they often insist that there are no analytical concepts or satisfactory data that allow that question to be answered, rather like medieval geographers who refuse to consider any evidence that the world is round unless it is written by members of the church in ecclesiastical Latin.</p><p>This learned helplessness reflects the tricky legacy of Robert Bork, an American scholar and judge who wrote \"The Antitrust Paradox\", a deeply influential book published in 1978. It correctly criticised blundering state intervention in the 1960s and 1970s, and pointed out that many big firms were efficient and many concentrated industries competitive. But Bork went further and argued there was no logical or empirical link between competition, profits and concentration. He also wrote that, when assessing takeovers, it did not matter if consumers were damaged by higher prices and less supply, as long as firms captured enough profits from efficiencies, so that in aggregate both were better off.</p><p>Bork's view of real firms has aged badly. He described the dynamism of Detroit's carmakers just before Japanese rivals exposed them as lazy and dangerous, and criticised AT&amp;T's break-up, which became a triumph for consumers. Forty years later the economy has changed. A battery of new studies link concentration, profits and falling wages. Intellectual property, not physical objects, is where the action is, and tech has created networked business models. Since 1978 total profits (that is corporate free cashflows, or the money that firms make after paying for investment) have risen from 1.9% of GDP to 4.5%. It is sensible to ask why competition is not bringing earnings down to earth and what might be done to boost it. The alternatives are to do nothing about inequality, or to introduce draconian taxes or regulation to redistribute income.</p><p>A working definition is that an industry may be uncompetitive if there is a concentration of sales, employees, intellectual property or data, and if returns on capital are abnormally high for long periods of time, with little sign of churn or new entrants. If you want a sense of the global hotspots, follow the money. It points you towards America, tech and others sectors not exposed to trade. </p><p>Consider the global pool of abnormal profits, or all the earnings that companies make above a hurdle rate for their cost of capital. This exercise assumes an 8% cost of capital excluding goodwill and includes the world's top 5,000 non-financial firms. In order to capture intangible assets, these figures capitalise research and development (R&amp;D) spending as an asset with a ten-year life.</p><p>Global \"excess\" profits are $660bn. Some 72% of that is made by American firms, split between tech, health care and sectors that are not exposed to trade, such as airlines and defence (see chart on next page). Other industries that are exposed to trade, including manufacturing, are less important. Europe accounts for 26% of the global pool of excess profits. Firms in the rest of the world capture 2%, with Chinese firms earning less than the hurdle rate.</p><p>At the national level, America and Europe can be examined using three tests: concentration, abnormal profits and openness. America scores badly (see charts on previous page). </p><p>Take concentration first. The numbers need to be treated with caution, but between 1997 and 2012 it rose in two-thirds of 900-odd census industries, with the weighted average market share of the top four firms growing from 26% to 32%. It continued to rise in 2012-14. A tenth of the economy is made up of industries where four firms have more than two-thirds of the market. </p><p>Profits are indeed abnormally high. A good measure is the free cashflow of corporate firms. This is 76% above its 50-year average, relative to GDP. There are pockets where profits and prices are high compared with other countries, including airlines, credit cards, telecoms, pharmaceutical distribution and credit checking. As anyone who has squeezed into an old economy-class seat or signed fiddly receipts at the check-out knows, these industries clearly lag behind the rest of the world. They also involve thickets of regulation.</p><p>As for openness, America is still the world's largest centre of innovation. It spends $450bn a year on R&amp;D, 20% more than China and more than Europe, Japan and South Korea combined. But business churn is subdued: of the listed firms that made a very high return in 1997, 50% still did in 2017 (using a hurdle of 15% and excluding goodwill). Fewer new firms are being started. And America's opening up to the world has stalled, with trade to GDP falling steadily since 2011 and the output of foreign firms' subsidiaries in America stagnating.</p><p>America became a unitary market more than 100 years ago. Europe has not finished the job. The typical big European firm is smaller than its American rival, reflecting a punier domestic market, with more global spread, showing the need to escape that market. There are few big tech firms. The largest generators of excess profits include Unilever and Nestl\u00e9, drugs firms, and luxury-goods stars such as LVMH that dress Crazy Rich Asians, not locals.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are grounds for concern. Europe relies on American tech firms. Concentration is creeping up. A forthcoming study by Chiara Criscuolo and colleagues at the OECD, a club of mainly rich countries, shows that the average market share of the top four firms in each industry has risen by three percentage points since 2000, roughly half of the rise in North America. The free cashflow of non-financial firms as a share of GDP is 18% above its 20-year average. A very profitable listed firm in 1997 had a 46% chance of still being very profitable in 2017. Like America, Europe has suffered a decline in the number of new firms. It is weak on innovation, spending half as much on R&amp;D in absolute terms as America. It scores better on trade, however, which has risen slightly relative to GDP since 2007.</p><p>Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist, distinguished between two kinds of competition. There is the daily battle of wits between two apple sellers. And then there are breakthroughs by entrepreneurs that transform how industries operate. These leaps are unpredictable. In 1920 America's cutting-edge giants included the Central Leather Company and Baldwin Locomotive, but they were soon overtaken by a new generation of consumer-goods firms. Perhaps today giant profits will stimulate a new leap in competition amid the fears of decline.</p><p>There are some green shoots. Investment among listed firms in America is rising at an annual rate of 18% as the Trump boom motors along. A giddy mood should lead to more start-ups. Retail, media and health-care firms live in terror of digital competitors. Some investors think that artificial intelligence could create the next Schumpeterian revolution. Masayoshi Son, a Japanese investor, is betting $100bn on the Singularity, the moment when computers become more intelligent than humans.</p><p>Other signs point towards entrenched power. The high stockmarket values of profitable firms show that investors think their advantages will endure. Protectionism will reduce competition. There are few new entrants in, say, internet search or American airlines or telecoms. And powerful firms intend to stay powerful tomorrow. Of the total capital spending and R&amp;D done by America's leading 500 companies, the top 20 firms account for 38%. Big firms are buying innovative start-ups. And data may bind customers to incumbent firms. At the heart of this is the modern world's greatest creation and biggest source of fear\u2014the tech industry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-L27J94C</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRG-KFR1-DY2R-2021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Webb</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Tis the season for corporate earnings. Market experts and investors alike will be closely following financial results set to be released by several technology bellwethers this week. Chief among them is chipmaker Intel Corp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A day before Intelis scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings, reports are out on efforts by Intelrivals to develop new laptop and server chips. \"The announcements, at a technical conference in Silicon Valley, include a long-awaited technology makeover for Transmeta Corp., a struggling start-up that pioneered energy-efficient chips for laptops and prodded Intelto follow suit. Centaur Technology Inc., a U.S. unit of Taiwan's Via Technologies Inc., is discussing ultra-small chips for portables. At the other end of the computing spectrum, Sun Microsystems Inc. and Fujitsu Inc. plan to describe new high-end chips for servers to outflank an Intel chip dubbed Itanium 2 . Though aimed at different markets, the new chips illustrate common pressures that are reshaping competition in the semiconductor industry,\" The Wall Street Journal said, noting that the new chips, \"to be discussed this week at the Microprocessor Forum , in San Jose, Calif., attack markets outside Intel's PC stronghold.\"</p><p>Intelis playing it cool, something it can afford to do when it holds a big share of the semiconductor marketplace. A spokesman told the Journal: \"There is always competition in semiconductors, although the names of the companies can change. We continue to invest aggressively in the technology and manufacturing that help us stay ahead of the competition.\" Don't expect Intelto give up on its hold on the chip market, though it will be interesting to watch as new flames fuel Intel's creativity for new products. * The Wall Street Journal: IntelRivals Will Present New Chips (Subscription required)</p><p>While Intelfends off competitors at this week's trade show, there are already high hopes for Intel's numbers. Reuters said today that Intel\"may rise ahead of its quarterly result on Tuesday. Deutsche Bank said on Friday it had raised its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold.' The stock rose slightly in after-hours trade on Friday.\" In its round-up of this week's earnings releases, The Financial Times gives this rosy assessment of what's in store for the U.S. economy overall: \"U.S. corporate profits have recovered strongly during this economic upswing and the outlook for company earnings is stronger, which should push the U.S. market higher before the end of the year,\" the article said. * Reuters via Forbes: Wall Street Seen Up In Thin Trade, IntelEyed * The Financial Times: Quarterly Earnings Reports Could Be Something To Savour * Intel's Q3 2003 Earnings Conf. Call -- 5:30 p.m. ET Tuesday</p><p>Motorola's Monday Surprise</p><p>Meanwhile, Wall Street will be watching Motorola closely today. The company is still reeling from the departure of its chief executive and lagging sales. Motorola jumped the gun on its earnings report. It was supposed to report its third-quarter earnings tomorrow, but it released its numbers this morning \"because of a downgrade of its debt issued late on Friday by Moody's ,\" Reuters said. \"Moody's cut Motorola's unsecured debt to one notch above junk, saying the No. 2 mobile phone maker faced tough challenges to boost sales and earnings amid intense competition. The company's subordinated debt was cut to junk by the rating agency. ... The credit rating agency said the downgrade 'considers the weakened outlook for most of Motorola's business segments' and expected strategic changes following the resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Christopher Galvin , who will leave when a successor is named.\" * Reuters via Yahoo!: Motorola To Report After Debt Downgrade * Chicago Tribune: Moody's Lowers Motorola Debt Rating</p><p>As for the numbers, Motorola said it logged $6.8 billion in sales for its third quarter, up from $6.5 billion in the same year-ago period. Despite its negative debt rating, Motorola went on the offensive today to paint a positive picture of its financial performance. \"Overall, the third quarter was a strong quarter for Motorola and one that signals some positive momentum in key aspects of our business. We again generated positive operating cash flow, for the 11th quarter in a row, reduced our net debt significantly, and increased sales 5% and orders 25% versus the prior year,\" Mike Zafirovski , president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. The company will say more today in a conference call after the close of the markets.</p><p>This Week's Earnings Checklist</p><p>Some of the big tech players set to release earning this week include: Apple , IBM and Siebel on Wednesday, and eBay and Sun MicroSystems on Thursday. Stay tuned.</p><p>A Qwest for Numbers</p><p>One dark spot in this week's numbers parade could be Qwest Communications . The telecom \"could issue its long-awaited audited financial results for 2000 and 2001 as early as this week, people familiar with the matter said,\" The Wall Street Journal reported today. \"Producing the audited financial results would be an important step toward resolving a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of Qwest's accounting but wouldn't in itself end the investigation, these people said. Qwest faces accounting investigations by both the SEC and the Justice Department, which also is conducting a grand-jury investigation into whether some Qwest executives illegally enriched themselves through deals with equipment suppliers.\" * The Wall Street Journal: Qwest Is Expected To Issue Its 2000, 2001 Results Soon (Subscription Required)</p><p>The Denver Post quoted one observer who said a settlement with the SEC may be a year or more away. \"It would not surprise me if a final SEC settlement does not occur until after the 2004 (presidential) election,\" Janco Partners analyst Tom Friedberg said. \"This has become far more of a political issue than a civil or criminal issue,\" he said. The Rocky Mountain News ran a report this weekend, highlighting more accusations of dubious behavior at the company. \"A federal grand jury is reviewing evidence that former senior Qwest executives illegally took discounted stock from some vendors in exchange for directing business their way, a regulatory filing and sources indicate. Prosecutors are investigating whether Qwest bought equipment for business reasons or as a way for certain former executives to make quick profits once the suppliers went public. The deals occurred while Joe Nacchio was chief executive,\" the article said. * The Denver Post: Qwest's Re-Audit May Clear Books, Not Air * The Rocky Mountain News: Grand Jury Eyes Qwest</p><p>Telecom's Long Hangover</p><p>Speaking of telecom, ITU Telecom World opened this weekend in Geneva, though with less fireworks than the previous show in 1999. \"Gone are the gigantic exhibition booths, some of which were built like pyramids, had their own elevators or were decorated daily with thousands of fresh roses. Sobriety is the new opulence at ITU Telecom World, the trade show organized every four years by the International Telecommunication Union , a UN agency,\" The Associated Press reported. \"Telecom World 2003, which opened last Saturday and ends October 18, comes amid sustained economic gloom and financial headaches for firms that spent billions of dollars in European bidding wars for licenses to run next-generation mobile networks but have been slow to develop phones and services and claw back their investments. This year's event has drawn 908 exhibitors from 46 countries -- down from 1,200 firms at the 1999 session.\" * The Associated Press via Australian IT: Telecom Show Loses Its Gloss</p><p>The Financial Times also noted that a number of \"big names are not exhibiting here this time, including Nokia , Siemens , IBM and Motorola . Others have disappeared altogether -- many carriers and network equipment makers went to the wall in a downturn precipitated by overcapacity as customers found their technology and services less than compelling. 'The avarice and greed of a few had tainted the sector and shaken the credibility of the people in the sector,' said Yoshio Utsumi , ITU secretary-general, at the show's opening.\" * The Financial Times: Leaders Own Up To Past Excesses</p><p>On a more positive note, IDG News Service said wireless technology will be all the rage at this year's show. \"Not only will broadband wireless LAN technology be a focus of the show, it will also be a service available to visitors and exhibitors. Swisscom AG , the official supplier of telecom services to Telecom World, has installed 50 hotspots in the exhibition halls,\" the article said. * IDG News Service via InfoWorld: Telecom World 2003 Reflects A Battered Industry</p><p>The SCO Chronicles</p><p>The New York Times yesterday reported that Utah-based SCO Group , \"the company that touched off a computer industry slugfest last spring by suing IBM over its use of Unix software, may find itself embarrassed by a similar claim against a company once related to SCO.\" According to the newspaper, \"in an unpublicized case, one of SCO's former sister companies, Lineo , has agreed to quietly settle a third party's accusations that it engaged in the same kind of copyright infringement that is at the heart of SCO's claim against IBM, industry executives who have been briefed on the matter said. The case spotlights the behind-the-scenes role of Canopy , an investment firm formed by Ray Noorda , the founder of Novell and a personal computer industry pioneer. Canopy is SCO's largest shareholder and formerly controlled Lineo.\"</p><p>More on the little-known case: \"Lineo was sued last year by MontaVista , a maker of software for specialized computers used in consumer and industrial applications that is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The MontaVista executives said they had been notified that software their programmers had written and licensed under the GNU General Public License -- the license that governs companies that distribute Linux software -- had appeared, with copyrights removed, in Lineo's software. The license, which allows for the free distribution of software, still requires that the copyright notices be retained. Neither side would comment on the settlement, which was put under a court seal last month,\" The New York Times reported. * The New York Times: Copyright Lawsuit Is Turnabout For SCO (Registration required)</p><p>Microsoft's Mobile Moment</p><p>While the telecom conference in Geneva is a shadow of its past, a few major announcements are still expected. Microsoft and Vodafone are out of the box early, with an announcement today that they will jointly develop standards for Web services on mobile devices. \"The initiative ... is intended to help software developers embed messaging, location, authentication and billing into applications used across mobile and PC platforms. The web services standard will be based on the industry standard Extensible Markup Language (XML),\" The Financial Times reported. * The Financial Times: Microsoft and Vodafone In Web Standards Pact</p><p>No surprise here: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates talked about what he sees as the answer to telecom's future success during a speech at the conference. It's software, he said (makes sense coming from the world's largest software maker). \"The thing is pretty simple. Software is the ingredient that helps continue to grow this industry,\" Gates said, according to Reuters. * Reuters via CNN/Money: Microsoft Makes Telecom Push</p><p>Filter is designed for hard-core techies, news junkies and technology professionals alike.

Throw into the mix heavily VC-funded startups selling for peanuts[7]\u00a0and high-profile companies closing and selling assets to competitors[8], and 'wild' assertions that the big tech bubble is about to burst may not seem so 'wild' after all. Of course, dotcom-bubble-burst v.2.0 has been predicted pretty much since the big boom-and-bust at the turn of the century, which saw a swathe of vastly overvalued startups go belly-up, bringing an entire industry to its knees. But the doom-monger express chugs on, with many[9] analysts, VCs[10], and experts predicting rocky roads ahead[11].New year, new dawn?</p><p>Just two weeks into the New Year, and we're already seeing signs of what could be to come throughout 2017 and beyond. On January 12\u00a0alone, Twitter-like social network App.net announced it was shutting shop[12], while publicly traded music-streaming company Pandora revealed it was cutting 7 percent of its workforce[13], as rumors continue to circulate[14] that it will soon be acquired. And a day earlier, three-year-old drone startup Lily, with $15 million in funding, announced it was closing down[15] after failing to secure more funds. But App.net, Pandora, and Lily are just the latest in a series of closures and downsizing announcements from across the technology industry in the first two weeks of 2017. Less than a week into the new year, troubled[16] cloud storage startup Bitcasa, funded to the tune of $21 million, posted a goodbye message[17] to its website announcing that the company was no more. Official confirmation of what's coming next for the people and platform has yet to emerge, but we heard that it may have been acquired[18] by Intel. Despite recently revealing grand plans to monetize and become a publishing powerhouse[19], growing its traffic 140 percent to 60 monthly visitors[20], Medium laid off 50 employees[21], equating to a third of its workforce. It's also closing its New York and Washington, D.C. offices. Founder and CEO Ev Williams explained the company's pivot, blaming a broken advertising system:It simply doesn't serve people. In fact, it's not designed to. The vast majority of articles, videos, and other 'content' we all consume on a daily basis is paid for \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 by corporations who are funding it in order to advance their goals. And it is measured, amplified, and rewarded based on its ability to do that. Period. As a result, we get well, what we get. And it's getting worse.Elsewhere, Instagram-competing camera app company VSCO, with $70 million in VC money since its 2011 launch, revealed it was shuttering its New York office[22] and laying off all the staff, though it wasn't clear how many that amounted to. And San Francisco culinary startup Zesty, founded in 2012 and with $10 million in VC funding, reportedly terminated a $20,000 monthly lease on a Mission District hub late last year, and in the first week of 2017 laid off 13 members of staff[23]. Then there's blood-testing company Theranos, which laid off 43 percent of its staff[24] in October, amounting to 340 employees, and followed it up last week with another 41 percent cut[25], or 155 workers. But that debacle is less to do with the state of its industry than longstanding controversy around[26] the company's flawed working practices. Still, the Palo Alto company is a major figure in the Silicon Valley startup scene, having nabbed more than $600 million in equity financing since its inception in 2003. Incidentally, the very same day, fellow medical-testing company Counsyl, with more than $150 million in VC funding, revealed it was cutting 5 percent[27] of its workforce, equating to 24 people. With almost $80 million in VC funding to its name, San Francisco-based events app maker DoubleDutch revealed it was cutting around 70 positions[28], or 40 percent of its workforce. This came\u00a0six months after it announced another[29] major staff cull. Closures and cuts in 2017 haven't been limited to U.S. companies. Earlier this week, London-based smartwatch maker Vector Watch announced it was closing down[30], with Fitbit snapping up the team and technology \u2014 a move that followed a month after the exact same thing[31] happened with Pebble. So what does this all mean for the year ahead? Doom and gloom, or hope?PredictionsA few weeks back, we asked a number of Silicon Valley VCs[32] what they expected to see in 2017 \u2014 including whether they anticipated a major bubble burst. 'You mean as it was predicted to in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016?,' said M.G. Siegler, general partner at GV. 'No, I do not.' Jerry Chen, partner at Greylock Partners, was equally dismissive of such suggestions, saying:I don't think we will see a burst, but interest rate hikes combined with investors who start to weigh risk better will lead to a new normal. We experienced a significant market correction earlier this year, and the market will no longer tolerate growth at all costs and companies with high burn rates. But the market will reward companies who build competitive moats, using cash strategically, and execute an effective go-to-market business model.Late last year, veteran stock market strategist Ned Riley \u2014 who apparently foresaw the original dotcom bust of the early 21st century \u2014 said that he doesn't see a particularly bad year[33] ahead for the tech industry. 'I look at 2017 as an exciting year,' said Riley. 'Secular growth for this sector is particularly strong for the next three to five years.' He added that he doesn't foresee the same 'irrational exuberance' that he saw back in 1999 and 2000. It's clear there will be more upheaval across the technology industry this year, with Twitter still in trouble and SoundCloud urgently seeking a buyer[34]. But it's easy to look at a handful of examples and extrapolate any number of conclusions. The flurry of closures and layoffs we've seen so far in 2017 could easily be a result of companies delaying announcements until after the Christmas break. Or it could be indicative of a major trend we'll continue to see throughout the year. We'll have to wait and see.

Strategist: 2021 earnings won't hit 2019 levels Earnings expected to plunge again but there are hopeful signs The bad news: Profits probably fell more than 20% compared to a year ago -- the second-worst drop since 2009. The good news: That's actually an improvement over the second quarter, when earnings suffered a more than 30% plunge. That was the worst since the Great Recession in 2009. But investors have gotten some hopeful signs lately: Wall Street analysts have boosted their earnings forecasts slightly for the third quarter, according to FactSet Research. Typically, Wall Street cuts its projections the closer companies get to reporting their numbers. On September 1, analysts were predicting a profit drop of 22.2% in the third quarter. Now, Wall Street is expecting a 21% drop. That's still a notable contraction, of course, but slightly less bad than the forecasts of just a month ago. The same thing has happened with sales estimates. Revenue for the third quarter is currently expected to decline 3.6% from a year ago versus forecasts of a 4.1% drop at the start of September. Have to admit it's getting better Sure, these may sound like subtle, incremental changes. And they are. But it's all part of a bigger trend. Analysts also expect continued improvement for earnings in the fourth quarter, with a projected profit drop of 12.7% and sales decrease of 1.2%. So Corporate America might be slowly turning the corner. Wall Street is forecasting a sizable rebound in earnings and revenue for the first half of 2021, too, with profits set to rise nearly 13% in the first quarter of next year and soar 44% in the second quarter. This earnings comeback is a big reason why stocks have skyrocketed from their March lows -- despite lingering concerns about coronavirus, worries about whether more stimulus is coming from Washington and, of course, questions about the upcoming presidential election (and how long it may take until a victor is declared). \"The market is taking a lot of comfort from the fact that even though we are going to get a big decline in the third quarter, it was much worse three months ago\" said Deepak Puri, chief investment officer of the Americas for Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \"We are moving in the right direction. That is the comforting factor. Economies and businesses are starting to reopen,\" he added. Puri also noted that it's encouraging to see that Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet, which make up a bulk of the S&amp;P 500, are unlikely to suffer much of a hit to sales and profits. In addition, earnings are starting to improve for companies in cyclical sectors that were hardest hit during the early part of the spring slump, such as industrials, materials and energy. Still, there are many wild cards in play that could wreak havoc on earnings going forward. Could a Joe Biden win over President Trump lead to higher taxes and more regulations on banks? Possibly. A second wave of Covid-19 cases in America also could cripple earnings growth and the broader economy. That's why Puri concedes that investors have to take current forecasts with a grain of salt. \"Estimates could go higher in 2021 due to expectations for a fast recovery. But the outlook is highly uncertain,\" he said. \"Reality almost never syncs up with the early estimates from analysts.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo -- happy Thursday to you.  It is Thursday, April 26th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings in the driver's seat on Wall Street this morning -- that is what's  dictating stocks.  The Dow Industrials expected to be up about 50 points  right out of the gate -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  The Nasdaq  is up two-thirds of a percent right now -- that's 38 points higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Technology titans Amazon and Microsoft will be headlining the biggest  earnings day of the season.  Both are due out tonight after the bell.  We  will preview.</p><p> Plus Facebook shaking off the scandal -- shares soaring in the premarket,  up better than 6 percent right now after the company beat expectations  yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users and monthly users.</p><p> The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by earnings from  Boeing.  The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue --  that helped it lift the Dow up about 60 points at the close, one-half of 1  percent.  The S&amp;P was up 5 but the Nasdaq was down about three-and-a-half.</p><p> In Europe this morning here's the scoop.  We've got money moving into  stocks as well but it is a fractional move.  The FT100, the CAC 40 and the  DAX index all higher by about between a quarter of a percent and half of a  percent.  Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank -- that  decision on rates due out later this hour.  No change in interest rates  expected but we will be watching ECB president, Mario Draghi and what he  says at his live news conference about stimulus going forward.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a look.  The shanghai composite  the worst performer in China, down one and a third percent.</p><p> A Wall Street retreat -- Deutsche Bank announcing plans to slash jobs in  the United States amid falling profits.  Details on the company's sprawling  rebuilding efforts.  Deutsche Bank shares are down two-thirds of a percent  this morning.</p><p> And then child's play for Amazon -- how the technology company is teaching  Alexa new parenting tricks.</p><p> Then, we will tell you the most cringe-worthy phrases used in the office.   I think we know a couple of them.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, along with Iraq and  Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth.</p><p> Great to see everybody today.</p><p> PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:   Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  I wonder what those phrases are -- and how many of those have I  said on TV.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"Try to think outside the box\" -- </p><p> HEGSETH:  Ok.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's one of them.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Is that what it is?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's one of them.  We'll bring you all the phrases.  But there  are -- I know a phrase you hate.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tell me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"Let's unpack this\".  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes -- you read my mind.  You read my mind.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You hate that phrase, I know it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And that's kind of recent.  And you know what I also hate?   \"Nothing burger\".  I hate it -- \"nothing burger\".</p><p> HEGSETH:  I like -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not just because Hillary Clinton used it.  But it's just over- used.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  I don't like \"with all due respect\", because you know what's  coming next -- little respect.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I love that one Rickey Bobby says, but other than that, not so  much.</p><p> Great earnings -- we'll see tomorrow if the economy and the fourth full  quarter of the Trump presidency is really moving to a higher level.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got the GDP out this week.  And of course, this is  the single busiest day for earnings so far.  And they have been largely  better than expected.  So we've got that profit story very much in place.   We're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p> But first our top story right now.  Emmanuel Macron addressed this Congress  in a rousing speech yesterday.  The French president made the case for  staying in the Iran nuclear deal, saying that the U.S. and France can work  together to forge a more comprehensive agreement that ultimately President  Trump can come to accept.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT:  As for Iran, our objective is clear.   Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons -- not now, not in five years,  not in 10 years, never.</p><p> This agreement may not address all concerns, but we should not abandon it  without having something substantial and more substantial instead.  That's  my position.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But later in the day, when speaking with reporters, Macron  conceded that he believes the President will exit the Iran deal, quote,  \"for domestic reasons\" and that of course, the deadline is next month.</p><p> Joining us now to talk about that is a member of the House Armed Services  Committee, Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California.   Congressman -- it's good to see you.  And thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA), HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Good morning.   Good to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So your take on both of these statements from the French  president.  We know that the President -- President Trump has until May  12th to decide whether or not to renew that Iran deal.  Your takeaway?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  He's right and I hope he's wrong.  He's absolutely right -- we  have to stay in it.  The JCPOA gives us the very best opportunity we have  to prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon.  Certainly for the next  decade, probably the next two decades, that agreement will prevent them  from having a nuclear weapon.</p><p> The second point, will the President back away from it?  I hope not.  It  would be a very, very serious mistake for a variety of reasons.</p><p> One, it would pull the United States away from key partners -- people that  we absolutely have to work with if we're going to deal with Syria and Iran  going into the future.</p><p> So let's hope that he's right on the first issue, that the JCPOA does  prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon; and secondly, that he's wrong  about what the President might do.  I think the President will recognize  the extraordinary risks to the position of the United States as a leader in  this world if he were to pull out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about changing certain areas?  I mean isn't it true that  there isn't enough opportunity to check whether or not they're being honest  in terms of what they're doing with their nuclear capabilities?  Are there  fixes that the allies can put in place to change this deal so the President  is more poised to stay in it?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Maria, you have a good point but you're slightly off the  target.  The view of what Iran is doing, that is, checking their nuclear  programs -- that's in place.</p><p> The problem is all of the other things that Iran is doing.  The Hezbollah,  the support that they're giving to Syria, the support for terrorists from  around the entire region -- all of those things were not included in the  Iran nuclear deal.  And those indeed are problems and the President is  correct that that needs to be addressed and certainly President Macron is  also quite correct, that we need to address those issues.</p><p> But that doesn't mean that we drop or exit the nuclear deal, which actually  is working and the reviews by the international agencies as to what is  happening in Iran are quite good, they are very incursive into Iran.  So  that's not he problem.</p><p> The problem is on the other things that Iran is doing beyond the nuclear.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Congressman it's Pete Hegseth -- </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Sure.</p><p> HEGSETH:  -- but this president gave Europe an opportunity to fill some of  the holes and fixes in the deal which doesn't provide -- you may think it  does, it doesn't provide oversight, it sunsets in 10 years.  We gave them  billions of dollars.  They use it to fund terrorism.</p><p> Why do you trust that the Iranians won't after ten years, even if  everything you're saying is true will actually give up their nuclear  ambitions?  Don't we have to be harder on them and have more visibility on  enforcement?  And how in the world does the existing deal do that?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  If you get into the details of the agreement, the nuclear  agreement, there are several stages along the way.  There is a 10-year.   There's also a 20-year and then Iran has signed on for the nonnuclear  proliferation treaty which is forever more into the future.  In other  words, they have committed to not engage in nuclear weapons activities in  the future.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Do you trust them?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Of course, we don't trust them.  That's why we have these  verification programs in place which are very, very intrusive.  And there  are many mechanisms to determine if in fact they begin 10 years, 15 years,  20 years out in the future to restart their nuclear program.  All of those  remain in place.</p><p> But there really is a very major concern, correctly stated by the  President, as well as by President Macron and others, that the other  activities that Iran has engaged in, particularly what we're seeing in  Syria right now, they are one of the major supporters of the Syrian -- of  the Assad government in Syria and they have perhaps thousands of troops in  Syria supporting the Syrian government and also working with Hezbollah,  threatening Israel and certainly having a major impact on Lebanon.</p><p> So all those things are concerns; they need to be dealt with.  France -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, how are they going to be dealt?  How are they going to be  dealt with if the President renews it and doesn't pull out?</p><p> I mean you're saying two things.  You said it's working.  You said the Iran  deal is working.  And then you said all of this stuff that they're doing --  dealing with Syria, supporting Hezbollah, threatening Israel -- so it's not  working.  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  No.  Maria -- that is not correct.  The deal did not deal with  those -- those issues that you just stated.  It dealt with the nuclear  thing.  It did not deal with the other issues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  And there -- and some -- many people believe that the deal was  not whole, it didn't cover everything and that's absolutely correct, it  didn't cover everything.  And that's absolutely correct.  It did not cover  everything.  It dealt with what was and remains today the most important  and that is that -- and President Macron said this very clearly -- Iran  will never have a nuclear weapon.  That's what the deal dealt with.</p><p> It didn't deal with the other activities, malicious and bad as they are.   We should be dealing with those and if we work together and we don't dump  the nuclear deal, which would create enormous division within the coalition  that actually brought about the nuclear deal, if we don't dump that, then  we will have a strong coalition to deal with these other issues rather than  -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  Congressman -- James Freeman here with the \"Journal\".  I'm  wondering, therefore, if you then support bringing back the sanctions that  were relieved by the deal as punishment for everything you just described  in terms of funding terrorism?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Well, there are other sanctions that are still in place,  additional sanctions may be necessary and they are always available to us  going into the future.  That's quite possible.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Does that mean you're not supporting them now?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  We need to work together with other countries.  Right now, all  of the focus is on the President threatening to dump the nuclear deal,  which would set all of this thing back and not allow us to move forward on  anything.  So that's the first problem.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I know but you just detailed all of their offenses in the region.   Doesn't that justify bringing sanctions?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  It could, and we need to be working with our allies on this  issue.  Some of those sanctions are a direct problem to our allies and that  -- and to the United States.</p><p> For example, there's a major deal that has been cut, Iran wants to purchase  dozens if not hundreds of new airliners.  That's a big deal for the airbus  and quite possibly for Boeing.  And so as you look at those sanctions, you  want to be careful to only use sanctions that are detrimental to Iran, not  detrimental to the interest of the coalition partners.</p><p> So what I'm saying is that sanctions are there.  They can be used.  But  just to go back and to put all of those back in place may create additional  problems and not achieve the goal.</p><p> So look at this thing carefully.  Use sanctions that are very targeted,  that do put the appropriate pressure on Iran so that they will back away  from many of the things.</p><p> But let me also put one more issue on the table and that is when the  President said three weeks ago that we had completed the work on ISIS, he  wanted to pull out the troops out of Syria, and that he wanted to leave  Syria to others.</p><p> Well, it turns out that the others are Russia, Iran, Turkey, and the Gulf  States.  That creates an enormous vacuum of power that will be filled by  Iran and that's not where we want to go.  So you have to look at this thing  in its total complexity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GARAMENDI:  And if we do, I think we can make progress, keep the nuclear  deal in place.  It is working and it will work for many years into the  future.</p><p> And secondly, make sure that we do apply the appropriate pressure.  Keep in  mind, Syria in this entire equation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Dagen -- did you want to say something?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  I just -- Congressman, you said look at the complete deal  and all that's going on in its entirety.  The problem that a lot of  Americans have with that nuclear deal with Iran in the first place is we  handed $1.7 billion in pallets of cash to Iran.  Where is that money going  as a state sponsor of terrorism?</p><p> It's going to fund terrorist attacks.  It's going to fund Hezbollah.  So  you can't really separate those two.  We gave them the money before there  was any evidence that they were really pulling back on the nuclear program.   We actually -- we flew it to Iran in the secret of night.  And the only  reason we even know about it is because of the reporting of the \"Wall  Street Journal\".  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Well, that coffee has been spilled.  That coffee's no longer in  the cup.  So what do we do going forward?  The nuclear deal is in place and  it is working.  That's a good thing.  That's a very, very important thing.   Now, let's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You keep saying it's working -- Congressman.</p><p> GARAMENDI:  It is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But all of these things that are not working are so obvious.   And then a moment ago you said we have to be careful because Iran's going  to buy all these jets, possibly from Boeing and from others and we have to  be careful about that.</p><p> What's our goal?  Is our goal to stop the nuclear capability or get  business for Boeing and the jet makers?  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Well, you're quite correct, our goal was to stop the nuclear  capability.  And that is happening.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How is that happening if they're supporting Syria?  They're  supporting Hezbollah.  They're threatening Israel.  And they're using the  $1.7 billion that we sent over there to do just that.  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  Calm down for a second and carefully take a listen to what you  just said.  The nuclear deal -- that was what we dealt with.  The JCPOA was  about Iran building a nuclear weapon and at that time -- </p><p> HEGSETH:  They're still building missiles -- Congressman.  They're still  testing and building missiles, delivery systems for nuclear capabilities.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GARAMENDI:  Hang on a second.  I want you to be very, very careful about  what we're talking about here.  Iran was on the cusp of actually building a  nuclear weapon.  They could have built one within one year, maybe less than  one year.  That's no longer the case.  They do not now have the materials  or the systems to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GARAMENDI:  That's what the JCPOA was about.  These other issues were not  part of that deal.  The important -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that was not smart.  That was not smart.  </p><p> GARAMENDI:  -- the important -- excuse me.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GARAMENDI:  Well, maybe so.  But I want you to understand Iran does not  have a nuclear weapon.  If they did have a nuclear weapon and all these  other things were going on, where would we be?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's the bottom line.  Congressman it's good to see  you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p> GARAMENDI:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for (INAUDIBLE) it all out.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the news keeps getting worse for Deutsche Bank -- a  stunning first quarter loss for the company.</p><p> Cheryl Casone on it and details right now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Oh man, Maria -- yes. </p><p> We're watching shares of Deutsche Bank this morning, very closely.  Net  income for the first quarter tumbled nearly 80 percent.  That is leading  the bank to cut jobs in the investment bank as well as Deutsche Bank saying  that they're going to focus investment banking on serving core European  clients.</p><p> They're going to reduce commitments to the U.S. and Asia.  These results  are Deutsche Bank's first since they ousted chief executive John Cryan back  on April 8th.</p><p> So here we go.  The stock is actually -- it's actually doing a little bit  better than it was earlier, we should say.  It's now down a little more  than a half a percent.  But again, some pressure on this stock today --  coming back a little bit.</p><p> All right.  Subway is planning to close 500 stores in the U.S. this year.   This is after the company announced a turnaround plan requiring franchise  owners to invest more in operations and this is also on the back of Subway  facing intense competition from rivals like McDonald's and Starbucks.   Subway's U.S. sales dropped more than 4 percent last year.  so another  stock to watch today.</p><p> Well, the European space agency has released the largest map of our galaxy  ever.  And it contains more than a billion stars -- it's actually really  cool.  The 360-degree map was compiled by the Guya Project over the last  few years.  It displays a full quarter of our galaxy. </p><p> It took photos from opposite sides of our planet's orbit to pinpoint each  star's exact locations.  The public release of this new map expected to  keep scientists and astronomers really busy studying stars for years to  come.  They're very excited about this.</p><p> And then there is this, a new study taking a look at cringe-worthy office  phrases.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get out of here.  I think I'm going to lose it.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Even though it's Thursday, maybe we do.  All right.  Researchers  say seven in ten Americans confess to saying such things as \"think outside  the box\" or perhaps \"give 110 percent\".  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mentioned that earlier.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There is no more than 100 percent.  Just saying that -- I didn't  even know that.</p><p> CASONE:  No.  There's more.  \"Hammer it out\".  Who likes that one, right?   \"Run this up the flag pole\".  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I hate that one.  </p><p> CASONE:  \"Throw them under the bus\".  And this could be a \"win-win  situation\".  How many times have you heard that one -- Maria and Dagen?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  I've heard it a few times.</p><p> HEGSETH:  I find this corporation specific stuff to be the worst.  One is  with a group that said we're not going to call them meetings anymore.   We're going to call them \"knowledge shares\".</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p> HEGSETH:  We're going to get together and do \"knowledge shares\".  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"Knowledge shares\".</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"Knowledge shares\".  That's hilarious.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  Is that (INAUDIBLE) run by a thought leader?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one more all men to avoid -- \"calm down\".  When you tell a  woman who is winning an argument with you to calm down -- generally stay  away from that.  We're going to hand you your business.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, was I not calm?  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Of course, you were calm.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think he didn't like the content.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I was calmly pushing back, saying no, I disagree, the Iran deal  stinks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's called passion and accuracy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.</p><p> Speaking of Wall Street debuts, Sonos reportedly preparing an IPO -- could  come as soon as June.  We're going to check that out.</p><p> And then Alexa is now teaching etiquette.  Amazon's smart assistant now  made to encourage kids to say \"please\" and \"thank you\", next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> The return of the trading desk -- according to the Wall Street journal U.S.  banks are having their best year for trading revenue since the financial  crisis because of the rise in volatility.</p><p> Joining us this morning Thomas H. Lee Partners co-president Scott Sperling.   Scott -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> SCOTT SPERLING, CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H. LEE PARTNERS:  Thank you -- Maria.   Good to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where do you see the growth right now?  Tell us about your  investing and how you're allocating capital -- Scott.  </p><p> SPERLING:  Well, I think the areas that people have been looking at are  ones where there's stronger secular growth trends and the entire health  care sector is one where that continues to be an interesting opportunity,  particularly in areas where you can help bend the cost curve, be able to  provide high quality services with a more cost efficient delivery  mechanism.</p><p> Another area is obviously the entire technology world offers significant  subsectors of opportunity.  The software area has been one that has been  incredibly popular.</p><p> One of the things that we always have to do is measure the secular growth  against the pricing it takes to buy those kinds of companies and I think  having a reasonable amount of discipline in today's world will be rewarded  long-term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing that both on the public side and on the private  side?  We started the conversation talking about the return of the trading  desk because of an increase in volatility.</p><p> Do you see that -- those growth areas both on the public side as well as  private side, which is what you're doing obviously, private investing?  </p><p> SPERLING:  Yes.  I think these areas are ones that will account for a  bigger and bigger percentage of the economic activity in the country,  regardless of whether you're looking at companies that are still private or  on the public side.  So I think these are areas that will be interesting in  both the public market as well as the private markets.</p><p> The ability of investors in today's public market to buy these companies at  multiples that look something like 16 to 17 times, down from probably 19 to  20 times, could be reasonably attractive.  The fundamentals that we see in  the economy right now continue to be relatively strong.</p><p> I think it's not unreasonable to expect 3 percent GDP growth.  I think when  you combine that with the stimulus and some of that's coming from the  stimulus of the tax cut, but combine it with the longer term impact of the  stimulus with the tax cut, you can see this playing out for a longer  duration than we ever would have thought when you look at the tenor of this  recovery period.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Question, James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\",  question on interest rates.</p><p> SPERLING:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Some people get a little nervous when the yield on the 10-year  treasury note hits 3 percent.  As you know, we've had a lot of good years  with that level -- good years for the economy, for the stock market.  But  I'm wondering what it means for you and your ability to do deals.  Where do  you get nervous in terms of that interest rate's going up or that number on  the 10-year going up?  </p><p> SPERLING:  Sure.  That is clearly part of the equation that we look at.  We  want to be in a world where the coverage ratios of our obligations is  reasonably high.  We never return to that '06 to '07 period when the  coverage ratios had gotten well below 1.5x -- 1.5 times.</p><p> So as you look at the cost of debt, that comes into the calculation of what  we're willing to pay for companies.  Three percent as you point out is  actually a relatively attractive rate when you look long-term at where  those rates have been.</p><p> Oftentimes in our history it's been closer to 5 percent but certainly it's  much higher than -- it's probably a hundred basis points higher than we  have gotten used to over the last few years.  So it has some impact on the  value that will own the paper (ph) companies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Scott -- what's your take on technology here?  I mean smart  speaker maker Sonos is reportedly going public.  The \"Journal\" first  reporting that the IPO could value the company as high as $3 billion.  Your  thoughts on the IPO landscape and where you see technology opportunities  today.  </p><p> SPERLING:  The markets will fall in and out of love obviously with any kind  of company and certainly the technology sector has benefited when you look  at the so-called FANG stocks and the impact that that has had in terms of  the growth of the equity market values.  It's been reasonably overwhelming.</p><p> So technology, because it does have significant secular growth in an  economy where growth has been hard has been very popular.  I think the  applicability of technology to everything we do in our lives, so Sonos for  example has certainly made it easier to have audio that has a diverse  number of sources available to people in their homes.  That kind of  technology is one that will scale very well in the consumer market and  people will pay for that.</p><p> Now, what you have to look at is what the nature of the competition will be  over time.  And while the overall market for that type of product, that  functionality will continue to grow very strongly and everyone will  evaluate the specific competitors within that to see what kind of share  that they will have Sonos clearly has benefited from the one of the early  drivers of this trend and this technology -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SPERLING:  -- and you see that, I think in the expected value I think they  want for the IPO.</p><p> FREEMAN:  We're talking about the Wall Street trading desk doing so well  and also about Deutsche Bank not doing well. You know, there are a lot of  these big U.S. banks that keep complaining that if regulators here demand,  they hold too much capital.  It'll be a big disadvantage versus their  overseas competitors and yet the U.S. banks seem to be crushing it versus  their international competition.</p><p> SPERLING:  Yes, they sure do.  I think you have -- look, you have smart  people across the industry, I can't comment on Deutsche Bank.  The people  we deal with are on the investment banking side and been very good.  I  can't comment more broadly on D.B. but the banks have adapted very well to  the new rules that have dramatically reduced the leverage ratios at our  commercial banking system.  </p><p> So, whereas in zero six zero seven you were looking at 20 to 30 times  leverage.  You know, today you're really looking at 10 to 12 times  leverage.  So, the ROE, the return on their equity is not going to be as  good as it was then but they've adapted very well to that.  You see Goldman  for example, Lloyd Blankfein has been out there talking about the consumer  opportunity that Goldman has, and --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SPERLING:  -- markets has been a major effort for them to provide a set of  services to the consumer market.  So, they are looking at new areas of  growth and at the same time, they continue to have very, very smart people  who are very helpful to people like us, who are looking to them for  financing and M&amp;A advice.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  Goldman's trying to get it -- is into  the retail market.  Blackstone Group into the retail market.  Scott, good  to see you sir.  </p><p> SPERLING:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Scott Sperling. ( CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H.  LEE PARTNERS )</p><p> SPERLING:  You're very welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning.</p><p> SPERLING:  Take care.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And to you.  Coming up technology earnings blitz, Amazon,  Microsoft, Intel all set to report results \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.  We're  breaking down what to expect.</p><p> Then policing your kids, watching the web.  Google now updating its YouTube  Kids app, to improve parental controls.  Back in a moment, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday April 26th.   Your top stories right now 07:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first quarter earnings today.  General Motors and Southwest  Airlines among the companies reporting this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations while Southwest was mixed.  There's a look at the stocks both  under pressure today.  G.M. down 2-1/2 percent, Southwest down 3-1/2  percent.  </p><p> Investors are also waiting on big tech.  AmazonIntel and Microsoft all  reporting their quarter after the close tonight.  Checking the broader  markets this morning while we see those stocks trading up and the broader  market up as well.  The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday and  the momentum continues this morning up 40 points on the Dow right now. </p><p>Boeing was a big earnings beat yesterday.  That stock was strong and that  lifted the Dow.  Up about 60 points at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up  about five, but the Nasdaq was under selling crasher finishing lower by 3- 1/2.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, stocks are trading up.  FT-100 CAC Quarante and the  DAX Index are higher.  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, the  others are fractionally moving, but in the plus column.</p><p> Investors are waiting on the ECB decision, the European Central Bank news  is going to be out in about 15 minutes.  No change in rate expected.  But  we are watching the ECB President Mario Draghi during his news conference  and what he says about stimulus going forward.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets were mixed.  China was the weak spot.  The  Shanghai Composite down one and a third percent.  </p><p> Big technology is now targeting kids.  Amazon and YouTube making changes so  that parents can breathe a sigh of relief, will tell you about it.  And  then it's NFL draft day.  We're taking a look at the technology that's  helping prevent player injuries.  All that coming up.  </p><p> But first this, technology earnings Blitz.  Tech giants Amazon, Microsoft  and Intel all do out \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.  </p><p> Meanwhile Facebook and Alphabet both beating expectations this week.  The  two technology darlings posted a spike in digital ad dollars accounting for  91 percent of Facebook's revenue and 97 percent of Google parent company  revenue.  That could give us some information about Amazon, because Amazon  will also report ad revenue with its prime business tonight.  Joining us  right now is AppNexus CEO, Brian O'Kelley.  Brian, good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p> BRIAN O'KELLEY, CEO, APPNEXUS:  Thanks for having me </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you have a great read on advertising revenue.  Explain  AppNexus and tell us what you're seeing in ad revenue right now.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  All right.  So, AppNexus is the technology that helps companies  who aren't Facebook get as much money for their content as possible.  So,  if you -- if you're watching FOX Business right now, you're seeing ads.   Who decides what ads you see?  Well, for many of the companies who aren't  Facebook, that's app Nexus.  We're trying to use machine learning and non- personal information to figure out which ads are the most effective to  serve to all the consumers watching T.V. or reading articles on the web.   So, that's what we do.  </p><p> Now the big challenge in advertising right now, is that if your Facebook or  Google you have an immense amount of data about consumers that they've --  in many cases freely given, and you can use that to micro-target ads.  But  of course, that also means that the consumer is the product.  You're  effectively selling the consumer their own data and monetizing that as you  see in these earnings incredibly well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly and that's what kept them in trouble.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  Indeed.  </p><p> PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Do you -- and you can avoid that  because you're not holding anyone's personal data.  You don't have the  Facebook problem of how do I protect your privacy.  Is that right?</p><p> O'KELLEY:  That's correct.  Of course, we have the opposite problem which  is that we don't know who you are.  And so, we have to use these macro  techniques to figure out what ads you'll probably like if you're watching  this show or if you're reading that article.  But we don't know who you  are.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  So, like we've seen in some recent years, Facebook and Alphabet,  Google's parent capturing almost all the growth or all the growth in online  advertising.  I believe in mobile advertising.  Is that trend changing?  </p><p> O'KELLEY:  Well, I think this last quarter we saw that decline a little  bit.  So, Google's share went down a little.  So, we're starting to see  that change. I think the biggest challenge is that if consumers continue to  want to go to Facebook or see videos on YouTube that's where the  advertisers are going to go.  So, the challenge is if you're any other  media company or content producer, how do you get the consumers to spend  less time on Facebook or spend less time on YouTube?</p><p> HEGSETH:  So, I mean that was part of the criticism of Facebook is there a  monopoly effectively in a particular space.  Do you anticipate competitors  then?  Would that would create that opportunity for other advertisers?</p><p> O'KELLEY:  I'd love to see competitors.  When you have a consumer backlash  against Facebook, people were very upset with Facebook and yet where do you  go?  You know? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  Tweet? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That goes -- that goes to what Sheryl Sandberg said on the call  yesterday that they haven't had seen a meaningful trend of advertisers  fleeing the platform.  It was a little strange because there was so much  advertiser outrage at YouTube when they found -- the advertisers found out  that their commercials were appearing and videos of questionable, if not  repugnant content.  But this, it's like, as long as the advertisers  attitude seems to be, as long as this benefits us we don't really care.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, and as a P.R. move they have this latest apology, a  promising to keep data safe.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But then something happened we had to deal with spam,  clickbait, fake news and data misuse.  That's going to change.</p><p> From now on, Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your  privacy.  So we can all get back to what made Facebook good in the first  place, friends.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that enough?  I mean the stock is up today after the strong  quarterly results because people are saying well maybe this didn't matter  to investors and advertisers.  </p><p> O'KELLEY:  I think it matters a ton.  I mean, when I talk to the largest  advertisers in the world they say consistently, I want an alternative to  YouTube and Facebook.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really?  OK.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  I don't want to spend my money there but that's where people  were spending all their time.  So, I think the biggest challenge is really  that, you can delete Facebook.  And I wish you would because (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know if you can delete it.  We were hearing that people  try to delete the app and they couldn't.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's like impossible to get rid of Facebook</p><p> O'KELLEY:  That's a monopoly.  So, what are we going to do?</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's this is obviously a product that a lot of consumers have  freely chosen to this point.  But this is interesting that you're hearing  from advertisers that they would like new options.  Because you look at  these earnings reports 50 percent growth in the ad revenue at Facebook.   They're still writing and increasingly writing checks even if they seem to  want more options.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  Yes, well one thing to think about is that as television becomes  more and more digital so, people cut the cord and we can actually do more  intelligent ad insertion into T.V.  Broadcast we show everyone the same ad.   But increasingly we can choose different ads for different people.  And  that means we can get much better results for television advertising.  And  I think that gives people a real alternative, where on digital advertising  right now YouTube has a huge monopoly of digital.  But don't forget that's  a small subset of all of the advertising that these big marketers are  spending.  So, it looks like a lot of digital but as we see T.V. come  towards this, we're going to see a very, very different landscape.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you need to figure out a better way to connect the viewer  and the customer with the actual buying opportunity which is what Instagram  which is owned by Facebook does so brilliantly.  It's like they show you  something and it's like click on this to click on this ad and you can  purchase it immediately literally with your finger, and your thumb print on  your iPhone.  So, again that that's the challenge for traditional  advertising.  Even if the video is delivered on this device.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then they can measure all of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They measure it all and then that's what the advertisers want.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, really important conversation.  Brian, thank you.   Thank you so much.</p><p> O'KELLEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Brian O'Kelly, joining us there, AppNexus.</p><p> Coming up, Alexa for kids.  The new way Amazon is helping to teach your  children manners.  Then keeping kids safe on the web YouTube rules out  improved parental controls as well.  Back in a moment, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, the European Central Bank has left interest  rates unchanged as expected.  We're waiting on Mario Draghi and his press  conference within the next hour to see if he has -- will reveal anything  else about stimulus.  No change in market action.  This in fact was  expected.  </p><p> Meanwhile there's this, Amazon is releasing a kid-friendly Echo Dot with  parental controls.  Alexa may already be listening in.  Gerri Willis, with  the details now, Gerri.  </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, she is listening in.  And  don't forget that.  But I'm a big fan.  And if you're worried about Alexa's  smart voice assistance eavesdropping on your conversations, well you  probably should be concerned and here's why.  By exploiting a coding error  in Alexa's skills, the researchers found a way to get the device to  continue listening even long after the software was activated.  </p><p>Amazon said it's fixed this problem.  But I have to tell you, she's  listening in on what you're saying.  And now Alexa may help you raise your  kids.  You're seeing the products right here.  It's the new Echo Dot for  kids.  They encase it in rubber basically and they put special content on  it just for kids.  Now, $79.99 is the original price for this.  </p><p> But if you want to buy the souped up version of this over time, you can get  access to audio books, radio stations, just for kids, Disney content,  Nickelodeon and National Geographic content, that will cost you extra after  the first year, $2.99 a month per kid and of course we've seen Google,  YouTube struggle with this very issue.  They have an app for kids that  hasn't worked very well and they're trying to make improvements to that.   But the kids Amazon feature is so interesting because they're trying to get  people to talk nice to Alexa.  So, if children say please, then they get  rewarded for it.  They're told (INAUDIBLE) thank you very much for that,  for speaking nicely to me.  And I hear that the real concern about this  isn't are you being nice to Alexa.  The real concern was Alexa is always a  woman's voice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WILLIS:  So, they didn't want people -- kids learning to be nasty to women.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think -- I can't believe this, that they're listening even  when you don't know that they're listening.  This is an incredibly story  Gerri, really.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We want to leave it there.  Because we have breaking news.  We  want to talk to you about this.  Dr. Ronny Jackson is pulling out of the  race for the V.A. Secretary.  Pete Hegseth, we are just getting this news.   Dagen, you saw it crossing.  Anything else?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is the reporting --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ronny Jackson.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is reporting from John Roberts, the Chief White House  Correspondent at the FOX News Channel.  But I think that this was expected,  was it not?  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes, I mean, as of last night it looked like it was likely, too  much stuff had come out.  And people didn't know if it was verified or not.   He was denying most of it.  It was a quick pick from this president as well  from a guy he truly respected with a -- with a proven record in the  military and as a doctor in the White House through to multiple  administrations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> HEGSETH:  I mean, he got a lot of praise from the Obama folks as well.  Too  much, too fast.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was these revelation that were put out, and quite frankly  when I put on Twitter, you know, it's an insult to snakes to call  Washington, D.C. A snake pit, that all of this information started coming  out in the press about allegations of drinking on the job, of pill  prescribing, questionable practices prescribing medication to people within  the White House.  I just thought it was deeply unfortunate.  And I don't  know why anybody -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's deeply unfortunate.  But apparently, there was a trip that  only a small cabal of people in the Obama administration was on and now we  understand that this is getting out.  I mean, it's really unfortunate what  the previous administration is doing to this current administration in  terms of leaks, in terms of trying hard to put all these barriers up in  place.  I actually think it's disgusting.  I mean it's a -- but it feels  like that's the only way this information could have gotten out.  That's  why I bring this up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, it does show what a nasty town Washington can be.  And  also, the oddity of this story is this is not a nominee who came from  somewhere else and these reports come out.  This is someone that is -- the  president has been working with closely, that the previous president worked  with closely.  You had a lot of people on the record from both parties  saying this is a solid citizen, a great colleague, and so to now have off  the record --</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- allegations.  Contrary to what the president and his  predecessor have said they witnessed, I find it just beyond bizarre that  this is what takes down a nominee.  But that's the culture we live in now.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  No, go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, there and -- you can speak to this.  There are great  entrenched interests.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In the way that the veterans administration operates, in terms  of the way that money is doled out.  So, if they think, these interests  think that somebody's going to come in and change the status quo in terms  of who gets the money and how much then --</p><p> HEGSETH:  The veterans industrial complex is powerful.  This guy was --  this president wants to shake it up.  He would have as well.  He never got  his encore.  He never got his confirmation hearing, said it was rumor and  innuendo which is incredibly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Isn't that right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's so awful.  Why didn't Obama fire him?  And why has President  Trump had such a good working experience with him?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's a cabal that wants to destroy Donald Trump.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they want chaos around him.  Your name has been floated out  there.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes, it has.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Would you want the job?  </p><p> HEGSETH:  If the president asked me to serve, great.  But he hasn't at this  point.  So, we'll see.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The NFL draft kicks off tonight on FOX as new  technology is helping players put their best foot forward.  Cheryl Casone  with all the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  About the foot Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  There you go.  NFL draft day is here, and as young athletes are  preparing to enter the league, the NFL is looking at new ways to protect  them.  So, I went down to the New York Giants training facility to find out  how a partnership with H.P. is helping them stay one step ahead of injury.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p> CASONE:  It's one of the biggest risks of playing in the NFL, injury.  But  it's not just concussions that take players out of the game.  With nearly  two-thirds of football injuries occurring in the lower limbs, the shoes  athletes wear can determine a team's fate.  </p><p> LEIGH WEISS, DIRECTOR OF REHABILITATION, NEW YORK GIANTS:  Shoes are no  longer seen as a piece of apparel.  You know, they're a piece of protective  equipment.  </p><p> CASONE:  Here at the New York Giants training facility, they are using  this.  Technology from H.P. with 3D scanning that creates digital profiles  of players' feet.  </p><p> JOE SKIBA, EQUIPMENT DIRECTOR, NEW YORK GIANTS:  It's taking your foot,  it's taking your length, it's taking your width.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.</p><p> SKIBA:  So, one of the most important things in today's game is players  safety.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> SKIBA:  So, the first thing we want to do is we want to take a scan and  make sure he's actually wearing the exact footwear he should be wearing to  perform on the field.  </p><p> CASONE:  Quarterback Davis Webb showed me how it all works.  </p><p> DAVIS WEBB, QUARTERBACK, NEW YORK GIANTS:  Your right foot is a -- is a  little bigger.</p><p> CASONE:  OK, your right arch is bigger than your left.  So, you do need  custom shoes?  </p><p> Turned out, he needed the equipment more than he thought.  </p><p> SKIBA:  So, we're going to put the recommendation right here.  </p><p> WEBB:  That's what I wear.  </p><p> CASONE:  Is this right?</p><p> SKIBA:  Actually, this is not -- this is actually not a set-up.  This is  actually the cleat that Davis actually wears.  </p><p> CASONE:  H.P. technology puts million-dollar players together with high end  shoes from Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, boosting performance and health.  </p><p> RON COUGHLIN, PRESIDENT, H.P. PERSONAL SYSTEMS:  There's probably no shoe  that has more pressure than a 300-pound linemen on a cleat.  And so, having  the best fit for them and the support, they probably have the highest need  in the world.  So, it was a great place for us to test our technology.  </p><p> CASONE:  Every player from all 32 NFL teams are being scanned for this  season.  </p><p> JENNIFER LANGTON, VICE PRESIDENT, NFL HEALTH AND SAFETY:  We can help bring  innovation to the space, i.e.  You know, the H.P. fit scanner, so they are  in the best cleat available for themselves.  </p><p> CASONE:  And the Giants are hoping their partnership with H.P. will give  them a shoe-in to the Super Bowl.  </p><p> WEISS:  So, at the end of the day, you know, the healthy football teams are  usually more successful football teams and that's -- and that's what we  started for.  </p><p> CASONE:  So, a healthy team is a winning team?  </p><p> WEISS:  Yes, that's what keeps me up at night.  </p><p> CASONE:  And since I'm a runner, I had to try it.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Wow, you have a big width difference.  Do you know that?  </p><p> CASONE:  No.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Really?</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, look at that.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  But you did come up with two cleats.</p><p> COUGHLIN:  In case, you are going to go out there.</p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p> CASONE:  All right, so yes, I learned a few things about my own feet as  well, Maria, when I went out and shot the story.  But --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you need custom made shoes?  </p><p> CASONE:  I need custom-made shoes.  I have a low arch on my left and a  right -- a high arch on my right.  I had no clue.  I have whacky feet.  But  so are they.  So, I feel better about it.  Anyway, the draft is tonight,  we're really excited.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Don't forget to catch the live coverage of  the NFL draft tonight, 8:00 p.m. Eastern time.  Showtime.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Still ahead, Kanye West causes a stir again after the rapper tweets  his praise of president Trump and has a new not so kind words of former  president Obama, next hour, right here.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it its Thursday, April 26th.

Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo -- happy Thursday to you.  It is Thursday, April 26th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in the driver's seat on Wall Street this morning -- that is what's  dictating stocks.  The Dow Industrials expected to be up about 50 points  right out of the gate -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  The Nasdaq  is up two-thirds of a percent right now -- that's 38 points higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology titans Amazon and Microsoft will be headlining the biggest  earnings day of the season.  Both are due out tonight after the bell.  We  will preview.</p><p>Plus Facebook shaking off the scandal -- shares soaring in the premarket,  up better than 6 percent right now after the company beat expectations  yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users and monthly users.</p><p>The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by earnings from  Boeing.  The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue --  that helped it lift the Dow up about 60 points at the close, one-half of 1  percent.  The S&amp;P was up 5 but the Nasdaq was down about three-and-a-half.</p><p>In Europe this morning here's the scoop.  We've got money moving into  stocks as well but it is a fractional move.  The FT100, the CAC 40 and the  DAX index all higher by about between a quarter of a percent and half of a  percent.  Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank -- that  decision on rates due out later this hour.  No change in interest rates  expected but we will be watching ECB president, Mario Draghi and what he  says at his live news conference about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a look.  The shanghai composite  the worst performer in China, down one and a third percent.</p><p>A Wall Street retreat -- Deutsche Bank announcing plans to slash jobs in  the United States amid falling profits.  Details on the company's sprawling  rebuilding efforts.  Deutsche Bank shares are down two-thirds of a percent  this morning.</p><p>And then child's play for Amazon -- how the technology company is teaching  Alexa new parenting tricks.</p><p>Then, we will tell you the most cringe-worthy phrases used in the office.   I think we know a couple of them.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, along with Iraq and  Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth.</p><p>Great to see everybody today.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:   Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  I wonder what those phrases are -- and how many of those have I  said on TV.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Try to think outside the box\" -- </p><p>HEGSETH:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's one of them.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Is that what it is?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's one of them.  We'll bring you all the phrases.  But there  are -- I know a phrase you hate.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tell me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Let's unpack this\".  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- you read my mind.  You read my mind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You hate that phrase, I know it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And that's kind of recent.  And you know what I also hate?   \"Nothing burger\".  I hate it -- \"nothing burger\".</p><p>HEGSETH:  I like -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not just because Hillary Clinton used it.  But it's just over- used.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  I don't like \"with all due respect\", because you know what's  coming next -- little respect.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I love that one Rickey Bobby says, but other than that, not so  much.</p><p>Great earnings -- we'll see tomorrow if the economy and the fourth full  quarter of the Trump presidency is really moving to a higher level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got the GDP out this week.  And of course, this is  the single busiest day for earnings so far.  And they have been largely  better than expected.  So we've got that profit story very much in place.   We're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>But first our top story right now.  Emmanuel Macron addressed this Congress  in a rousing speech yesterday.  The French president made the case for  staying in the Iran nuclear deal, saying that the U.S. and France can work  together to forge a more comprehensive agreement that ultimately President  Trump can come to accept.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT:  As for Iran, our objective is clear.   Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons -- not now, not in five years,  not in 10 years, never.</p><p>This agreement may not address all concerns, but we should not abandon it  without having something substantial and more substantial instead.  That's  my position.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But later in the day, when speaking with reporters, Macron  conceded that he believes the President will exit the Iran deal, quote,  \"for domestic reasons\" and that of course, the deadline is next month.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about that is a member of the House Armed Services  Committee, Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California.   Congressman -- it's good to see you.  And thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA), HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Good morning.   Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your take on both of these statements from the French  president.  We know that the President -- President Trump has until May  12th to decide whether or not to renew that Iran deal.  Your takeaway?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  He's right and I hope he's wrong.  He's absolutely right -- we  have to stay in it.  The JCPOA gives us the very best opportunity we have  to prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon.  Certainly for the next  decade, probably the next two decades, that agreement will prevent them  from having a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The second point, will the President back away from it?  I hope not.  It  would be a very, very serious mistake for a variety of reasons.</p><p>One, it would pull the United States away from key partners -- people that  we absolutely have to work with if we're going to deal with Syria and Iran  going into the future.</p><p>So let's hope that he's right on the first issue, that the JCPOA does  prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon; and secondly, that he's wrong  about what the President might do.  I think the President will recognize  the extraordinary risks to the position of the United States as a leader in  this world if he were to pull out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about changing certain areas?  I mean isn't it true that  there isn't enough opportunity to check whether or not they're being honest  in terms of what they're doing with their nuclear capabilities?  Are there  fixes that the allies can put in place to change this deal so the President  is more poised to stay in it?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Maria, you have a good point but you're slightly off the  target.  The view of what Iran is doing, that is, checking their nuclear  programs -- that's in place.</p><p>The problem is all of the other things that Iran is doing.  The Hezbollah,  the support that they're giving to Syria, the support for terrorists from  around the entire region -- all of those things were not included in the  Iran nuclear deal.  And those indeed are problems and the President is  correct that that needs to be addressed and certainly President Macron is  also quite correct, that we need to address those issues.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that we drop or exit the nuclear deal, which actually  is working and the reviews by the international agencies as to what is  happening in Iran are quite good, they are very incursive into Iran.  So  that's not he problem.</p><p>The problem is on the other things that Iran is doing beyond the nuclear.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Congressman it's Pete Hegseth -- </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Sure.</p><p>HEGSETH:  -- but this president gave Europe an opportunity to fill some of  the holes and fixes in the deal which doesn't provide -- you may think it  does, it doesn't provide oversight, it sunsets in 10 years.  We gave them  billions of dollars.  They use it to fund terrorism.</p><p>Why do you trust that the Iranians won't after ten years, even if  everything you're saying is true will actually give up their nuclear  ambitions?  Don't we have to be harder on them and have more visibility on  enforcement?  And how in the world does the existing deal do that?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  If you get into the details of the agreement, the nuclear  agreement, there are several stages along the way.  There is a 10-year.   There's also a 20-year and then Iran has signed on for the nonnuclear  proliferation treaty which is forever more into the future.  In other  words, they have committed to not engage in nuclear weapons activities in  the future.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Do you trust them?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Of course, we don't trust them.  That's why we have these  verification programs in place which are very, very intrusive.  And there  are many mechanisms to determine if in fact they begin 10 years, 15 years,  20 years out in the future to restart their nuclear program.  All of those  remain in place.</p><p>But there really is a very major concern, correctly stated by the  President, as well as by President Macron and others, that the other  activities that Iran has engaged in, particularly what we're seeing in  Syria right now, they are one of the major supporters of the Syrian -- of  the Assad government in Syria and they have perhaps thousands of troops in  Syria supporting the Syrian government and also working with Hezbollah,  threatening Israel and certainly having a major impact on Lebanon.</p><p>So all those things are concerns; they need to be dealt with.  France -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how are they going to be dealt?  How are they going to be  dealt with if the President renews it and doesn't pull out?</p><p>I mean you're saying two things.  You said it's working.  You said the Iran  deal is working.  And then you said all of this stuff that they're doing --  dealing with Syria, supporting Hezbollah, threatening Israel -- so it's not  working.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  No.  Maria -- that is not correct.  The deal did not deal with  those -- those issues that you just stated.  It dealt with the nuclear  thing.  It did not deal with the other issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  And there -- and some -- many people believe that the deal was  not whole, it didn't cover everything and that's absolutely correct, it  didn't cover everything.  And that's absolutely correct.  It did not cover  everything.  It dealt with what was and remains today the most important  and that is that -- and President Macron said this very clearly -- Iran  will never have a nuclear weapon.  That's what the deal dealt with.</p><p>It didn't deal with the other activities, malicious and bad as they are.   We should be dealing with those and if we work together and we don't dump  the nuclear deal, which would create enormous division within the coalition  that actually brought about the nuclear deal, if we don't dump that, then  we will have a strong coalition to deal with these other issues rather than  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman -- James Freeman here with the \"Journal\".  I'm  wondering, therefore, if you then support bringing back the sanctions that  were relieved by the deal as punishment for everything you just described  in terms of funding terrorism?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, there are other sanctions that are still in place,  additional sanctions may be necessary and they are always available to us  going into the future.  That's quite possible.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Does that mean you're not supporting them now?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  We need to work together with other countries.  Right now, all  of the focus is on the President threatening to dump the nuclear deal,  which would set all of this thing back and not allow us to move forward on  anything.  So that's the first problem.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I know but you just detailed all of their offenses in the region.   Doesn't that justify bringing sanctions?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  It could, and we need to be working with our allies on this  issue.  Some of those sanctions are a direct problem to our allies and that  -- and to the United States.</p><p>For example, there's a major deal that has been cut, Iran wants to purchase  dozens if not hundreds of new airliners.  That's a big deal for the airbus  and quite possibly for Boeing.  And so as you look at those sanctions, you  want to be careful to only use sanctions that are detrimental to Iran, not  detrimental to the interest of the coalition partners.</p><p>So what I'm saying is that sanctions are there.  They can be used.  But  just to go back and to put all of those back in place may create additional  problems and not achieve the goal.</p><p>So look at this thing carefully.  Use sanctions that are very targeted,  that do put the appropriate pressure on Iran so that they will back away  from many of the things.</p><p>But let me also put one more issue on the table and that is when the  President said three weeks ago that we had completed the work on ISIS, he  wanted to pull out the troops out of Syria, and that he wanted to leave  Syria to others.</p><p>Well, it turns out that the others are Russia, Iran, Turkey, and the Gulf  States.  That creates an enormous vacuum of power that will be filled by  Iran and that's not where we want to go.  So you have to look at this thing  in its total complexity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  And if we do, I think we can make progress, keep the nuclear  deal in place.  It is working and it will work for many years into the  future.</p><p>And secondly, make sure that we do apply the appropriate pressure.  Keep in  mind, Syria in this entire equation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Dagen -- did you want to say something?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I just -- Congressman, you said look at the complete deal  and all that's going on in its entirety.  The problem that a lot of  Americans have with that nuclear deal with Iran in the first place is we  handed $1.7 billion in pallets of cash to Iran.  Where is that money going  as a state sponsor of terrorism?</p><p>It's going to fund terrorist attacks.  It's going to fund Hezbollah.  So  you can't really separate those two.  We gave them the money before there  was any evidence that they were really pulling back on the nuclear program.   We actually -- we flew it to Iran in the secret of night.  And the only  reason we even know about it is because of the reporting of the \"Wall  Street Journal\".  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, that coffee has been spilled.  That coffee's no longer in  the cup.  So what do we do going forward?  The nuclear deal is in place and  it is working.  That's a good thing.  That's a very, very important thing.   Now, let's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You keep saying it's working -- Congressman.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But all of these things that are not working are so obvious.   And then a moment ago you said we have to be careful because Iran's going  to buy all these jets, possibly from Boeing and from others and we have to  be careful about that.</p><p>What's our goal?  Is our goal to stop the nuclear capability or get  business for Boeing and the jet makers?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, you're quite correct, our goal was to stop the nuclear  capability.  And that is happening.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is that happening if they're supporting Syria?  They're  supporting Hezbollah.  They're threatening Israel.  And they're using the  $1.7 billion that we sent over there to do just that.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Calm down for a second and carefully take a listen to what you  just said.  The nuclear deal -- that was what we dealt with.  The JCPOA was  about Iran building a nuclear weapon and at that time -- </p><p>HEGSETH:  They're still building missiles -- Congressman.  They're still  testing and building missiles, delivery systems for nuclear capabilities.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Hang on a second.  I want you to be very, very careful about  what we're talking about here.  Iran was on the cusp of actually building a  nuclear weapon.  They could have built one within one year, maybe less than  one year.  That's no longer the case.  They do not now have the materials  or the systems to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  That's what the JCPOA was about.  These other issues were not  part of that deal.  The important -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that was not smart.  That was not smart.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  -- the important -- excuse me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, maybe so.  But I want you to understand Iran does not  have a nuclear weapon.  If they did have a nuclear weapon and all these  other things were going on, where would we be?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's the bottom line.  Congressman it's good to see  you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for (INAUDIBLE) it all out.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the news keeps getting worse for Deutsche Bank -- a  stunning first quarter loss for the company.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on it and details right now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Oh man, Maria -- yes. </p><p>We're watching shares of Deutsche Bank this morning, very closely.  Net  income for the first quarter tumbled nearly 80 percent.  That is leading  the bank to cut jobs in the investment bank as well as Deutsche Bank saying  that they're going to focus investment banking on serving core European  clients.</p><p>They're going to reduce commitments to the U.S. and Asia.  These results  are Deutsche Bank's first since they ousted chief executive John Cryan back  on April 8th.</p><p>So here we go.  The stock is actually -- it's actually doing a little bit  better than it was earlier, we should say.  It's now down a little more  than a half a percent.  But again, some pressure on this stock today --  coming back a little bit.</p><p>All right.  Subway is planning to close 500 stores in the U.S. this year.   This is after the company announced a turnaround plan requiring franchise  owners to invest more in operations and this is also on the back of Subway  facing intense competition from rivals like McDonald's and Starbucks.   Subway's U.S. sales dropped more than 4 percent last year.  so another  stock to watch today.</p><p>Well, the European space agency has released the largest map of our galaxy  ever.  And it contains more than a billion stars -- it's actually really  cool.  The 360-degree map was compiled by the Guya Project over the last  few years.  It displays a full quarter of our galaxy. </p><p>It took photos from opposite sides of our planet's orbit to pinpoint each  star's exact locations.  The public release of this new map expected to  keep scientists and astronomers really busy studying stars for years to  come.  They're very excited about this.</p><p>And then there is this, a new study taking a look at cringe-worthy office  phrases.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get out of here.  I think I'm going to lose it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Even though it's Thursday, maybe we do.  All right.  Researchers  say seven in ten Americans confess to saying such things as \"think outside  the box\" or perhaps \"give 110 percent\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mentioned that earlier.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There is no more than 100 percent.  Just saying that -- I didn't  even know that.</p><p>CASONE:  No.  There's more.  \"Hammer it out\".  Who likes that one, right?   \"Run this up the flag pole\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I hate that one.  </p><p>CASONE:  \"Throw them under the bus\".  And this could be a \"win-win  situation\".  How many times have you heard that one -- Maria and Dagen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  I've heard it a few times.</p><p>HEGSETH:  I find this corporation specific stuff to be the worst.  One is  with a group that said we're not going to call them meetings anymore.   We're going to call them \"knowledge shares\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>HEGSETH:  We're going to get together and do \"knowledge shares\".  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Knowledge shares\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Knowledge shares\".  That's hilarious.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is that (INAUDIBLE) run by a thought leader?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one more all men to avoid -- \"calm down\".  When you tell a  woman who is winning an argument with you to calm down -- generally stay  away from that.  We're going to hand you your business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, was I not calm?  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Of course, you were calm.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think he didn't like the content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was calmly pushing back, saying no, I disagree, the Iran deal  stinks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called passion and accuracy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.</p><p>Speaking of Wall Street debuts, Sonos reportedly preparing an IPO -- could  come as soon as June.  We're going to check that out.</p><p>And then Alexa is now teaching etiquette.  Amazon's smart assistant now  made to encourage kids to say \"please\" and \"thank you\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The return of the trading desk -- according to the Wall Street journal U.S.  banks are having their best year for trading revenue since the financial  crisis because of the rise in volatility.</p><p>Joining us this morning Thomas H. Lee Partners co-president Scott Sperling.   Scott -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>SCOTT SPERLING, CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H. LEE PARTNERS:  Thank you -- Maria.   Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you see the growth right now?  Tell us about your  investing and how you're allocating capital -- Scott.  </p><p>SPERLING:  Well, I think the areas that people have been looking at are  ones where there's stronger secular growth trends and the entire health  care sector is one where that continues to be an interesting opportunity,  particularly in areas where you can help bend the cost curve, be able to  provide high quality services with a more cost efficient delivery  mechanism.</p><p>Another area is obviously the entire technology world offers significant  subsectors of opportunity.  The software area has been one that has been  incredibly popular.</p><p>One of the things that we always have to do is measure the secular growth  against the pricing it takes to buy those kinds of companies and I think  having a reasonable amount of discipline in today's world will be rewarded  long-term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing that both on the public side and on the private  side?  We started the conversation talking about the return of the trading  desk because of an increase in volatility.</p><p>Do you see that -- those growth areas both on the public side as well as  private side, which is what you're doing obviously, private investing?  </p><p>SPERLING:  Yes.  I think these areas are ones that will account for a  bigger and bigger percentage of the economic activity in the country,  regardless of whether you're looking at companies that are still private or  on the public side.  So I think these are areas that will be interesting in  both the public market as well as the private markets.</p><p>The ability of investors in today's public market to buy these companies at  multiples that look something like 16 to 17 times, down from probably 19 to  20 times, could be reasonably attractive.  The fundamentals that we see in  the economy right now continue to be relatively strong.</p><p>I think it's not unreasonable to expect 3 percent GDP growth.  I think when  you combine that with the stimulus and some of that's coming from the  stimulus of the tax cut, but combine it with the longer term impact of the  stimulus with the tax cut, you can see this playing out for a longer  duration than we ever would have thought when you look at the tenor of this  recovery period.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Question, James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\",  question on interest rates.</p><p>SPERLING:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Some people get a little nervous when the yield on the 10-year  treasury note hits 3 percent.  As you know, we've had a lot of good years  with that level -- good years for the economy, for the stock market.  But  I'm wondering what it means for you and your ability to do deals.  Where do  you get nervous in terms of that interest rate's going up or that number on  the 10-year going up?  </p><p>SPERLING:  Sure.  That is clearly part of the equation that we look at.  We  want to be in a world where the coverage ratios of our obligations is  reasonably high.  We never return to that '06 to '07 period when the  coverage ratios had gotten well below 1.5x -- 1.5 times.</p><p>So as you look at the cost of debt, that comes into the calculation of what  we're willing to pay for companies.  Three percent as you point out is  actually a relatively attractive rate when you look long-term at where  those rates have been.</p><p>Oftentimes in our history it's been closer to 5 percent but certainly it's  much higher than -- it's probably a hundred basis points higher than we  have gotten used to over the last few years.  So it has some impact on the  value that will own the paper (ph) companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott -- what's your take on technology here?  I mean smart  speaker maker Sonos is reportedly going public.  The \"Journal\" first  reporting that the IPO could value the company as high as $3 billion.  Your  thoughts on the IPO landscape and where you see technology opportunities  today.  </p><p>SPERLING:  The markets will fall in and out of love obviously with any kind  of company and certainly the technology sector has benefited when you look  at the so-called FANG stocks and the impact that that has had in terms of  the growth of the equity market values.  It's been reasonably overwhelming.</p><p>So technology, because it does have significant secular growth in an  economy where growth has been hard has been very popular.  I think the  applicability of technology to everything we do in our lives, so Sonos for  example has certainly made it easier to have audio that has a diverse  number of sources available to people in their homes.  That kind of  technology is one that will scale very well in the consumer market and  people will pay for that.</p><p>Now, what you have to look at is what the nature of the competition will be  over time.  And while the overall market for that type of product, that  functionality will continue to grow very strongly and everyone will  evaluate the specific competitors within that to see what kind of share  that they will have Sonos clearly has benefited from the one of the early  drivers of this trend and this technology -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SPERLING:  -- and you see that, I think in the expected value I think they  want for the IPO.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We're talking about the Wall Street trading desk doing so well  and also about Deutsche Bank not doing well. You know, there are a lot of  these big U.S. banks that keep complaining that if regulators here demand,  they hold too much capital.  It'll be a big disadvantage versus their  overseas competitors and yet the U.S. banks seem to be crushing it versus  their international competition.</p><p>SPERLING:  Yes, they sure do.  I think you have -- look, you have smart  people across the industry, I can't comment on Deutsche Bank.  The people  we deal with are on the investment banking side and been very good.  I  can't comment more broadly on D.B. but the banks have adapted very well to  the new rules that have dramatically reduced the leverage ratios at our  commercial banking system.  </p><p>So, whereas in zero six zero seven you were looking at 20 to 30 times  leverage.  You know, today you're really looking at 10 to 12 times  leverage.  So, the ROE, the return on their equity is not going to be as  good as it was then but they've adapted very well to that.  You see Goldman  for example, Lloyd Blankfein has been out there talking about the consumer  opportunity that Goldman has, and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPERLING:  -- markets has been a major effort for them to provide a set of  services to the consumer market.  So, they are looking at new areas of  growth and at the same time, they continue to have very, very smart people  who are very helpful to people like us, who are looking to them for  financing and M&amp;A advice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  Goldman's trying to get it -- is into  the retail market.  Blackstone Group into the retail market.  Scott, good  to see you sir.  </p><p>SPERLING:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Scott Sperling. ( CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H.  LEE PARTNERS )</p><p>SPERLING:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning.</p><p>SPERLING:  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.  Coming up technology earnings blitz, Amazon,  Microsoft, Intel all set to report results \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.  We're  breaking down what to expect.</p><p>Then policing your kids, watching the web.  Google now updating its YouTube  Kids app, to improve parental controls.  Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday April 26th.   Your top stories right now 07:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first quarter earnings today.  General Motors and Southwest  Airlines among the companies reporting this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations while Southwest was mixed.  There's a look at the stocks both  under pressure today.  G.M. down 2-1/2 percent, Southwest down 3-1/2  percent.  </p><p>Investors are also waiting on big tech.  AmazonIntel and Microsoft all  reporting their quarter after the close tonight.  Checking the broader  markets this morning while we see those stocks trading up and the broader  market up as well.  The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday and  the momentum continues this morning up 40 points on the Dow right now. </p><p>Boeing was a big earnings beat yesterday.  That stock was strong and that  lifted the Dow.  Up about 60 points at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up  about five, but the Nasdaq was under selling crasher finishing lower by 3- 1/2.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are trading up.  FT-100 CAC Quarante and the  DAX Index are higher.  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, the  others are fractionally moving, but in the plus column.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the ECB decision, the European Central Bank news  is going to be out in about 15 minutes.  No change in rate expected.  But  we are watching the ECB President Mario Draghi during his news conference  and what he says about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed.  China was the weak spot.  The  Shanghai Composite down one and a third percent.  </p><p>Big technology is now targeting kids.  Amazon and YouTube making changes so  that parents can breathe a sigh of relief, will tell you about it.  And  then it's NFL draft day.  We're taking a look at the technology that's  helping prevent player injuries.  All that coming up.  </p><p>But first this, technology earnings Blitz.  Tech giants Amazon, Microsoft  and Intel all do out \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.  </p><p>Meanwhile Facebook and Alphabet both beating expectations this week.  The  two technology darlings posted a spike in digital ad dollars accounting for  91 percent of Facebook's revenue and 97 percent of Google parent company  revenue.  That could give us some information about Amazon, because Amazon  will also report ad revenue with its prime business tonight.  Joining us  right now is AppNexus CEO, Brian O'Kelley.  Brian, good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRIAN O'KELLEY, CEO, APPNEXUS:  Thanks for having me </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have a great read on advertising revenue.  Explain  AppNexus and tell us what you're seeing in ad revenue right now.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  All right.  So, AppNexus is the technology that helps companies  who aren't Facebook get as much money for their content as possible.  So,  if you -- if you're watching FOX Business right now, you're seeing ads.   Who decides what ads you see?  Well, for many of the companies who aren't  Facebook, that's app Nexus.  We're trying to use machine learning and non- personal information to figure out which ads are the most effective to  serve to all the consumers watching T.V. or reading articles on the web.   So, that's what we do.  </p><p>Now the big challenge in advertising right now, is that if your Facebook or  Google you have an immense amount of data about consumers that they've --  in many cases freely given, and you can use that to micro-target ads.  But  of course, that also means that the consumer is the product.  You're  effectively selling the consumer their own data and monetizing that as you  see in these earnings incredibly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly and that's what kept them in trouble.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Indeed.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Do you -- and you can avoid that  because you're not holding anyone's personal data.  You don't have the  Facebook problem of how do I protect your privacy.  Is that right?</p><p>O'KELLEY:  That's correct.  Of course, we have the opposite problem which  is that we don't know who you are.  And so, we have to use these macro  techniques to figure out what ads you'll probably like if you're watching  this show or if you're reading that article.  But we don't know who you  are.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, like we've seen in some recent years, Facebook and Alphabet,  Google's parent capturing almost all the growth or all the growth in online  advertising.  I believe in mobile advertising.  Is that trend changing?  </p><p>O'KELLEY:  Well, I think this last quarter we saw that decline a little  bit.  So, Google's share went down a little.  So, we're starting to see  that change. I think the biggest challenge is that if consumers continue to  want to go to Facebook or see videos on YouTube that's where the  advertisers are going to go.  So, the challenge is if you're any other  media company or content producer, how do you get the consumers to spend  less time on Facebook or spend less time on YouTube?</p><p>HEGSETH:  So, I mean that was part of the criticism of Facebook is there a  monopoly effectively in a particular space.  Do you anticipate competitors  then?  Would that would create that opportunity for other advertisers?</p><p>O'KELLEY:  I'd love to see competitors.  When you have a consumer backlash  against Facebook, people were very upset with Facebook and yet where do you  go?  You know? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Tweet? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That goes -- that goes to what Sheryl Sandberg said on the call  yesterday that they haven't had seen a meaningful trend of advertisers  fleeing the platform.  It was a little strange because there was so much  advertiser outrage at YouTube when they found -- the advertisers found out  that their commercials were appearing and videos of questionable, if not  repugnant content.  But this, it's like, as long as the advertisers  attitude seems to be, as long as this benefits us we don't really care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, and as a P.R. move they have this latest apology, a  promising to keep data safe.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But then something happened we had to deal with spam,  clickbait, fake news and data misuse.  That's going to change.</p><p>From now on, Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your  privacy.  So we can all get back to what made Facebook good in the first  place, friends.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that enough?  I mean the stock is up today after the strong  quarterly results because people are saying well maybe this didn't matter  to investors and advertisers.  </p><p>O'KELLEY:  I think it matters a ton.  I mean, when I talk to the largest  advertisers in the world they say consistently, I want an alternative to  YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  OK.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  I don't want to spend my money there but that's where people  were spending all their time.  So, I think the biggest challenge is really  that, you can delete Facebook.  And I wish you would because (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if you can delete it.  We were hearing that people  try to delete the app and they couldn't.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's like impossible to get rid of Facebook</p><p>O'KELLEY:  That's a monopoly.  So, what are we going to do?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's this is obviously a product that a lot of consumers have  freely chosen to this point.  But this is interesting that you're hearing  from advertisers that they would like new options.  Because you look at  these earnings reports 50 percent growth in the ad revenue at Facebook.   They're still writing and increasingly writing checks even if they seem to  want more options.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Yes, well one thing to think about is that as television becomes  more and more digital so, people cut the cord and we can actually do more  intelligent ad insertion into T.V.  Broadcast we show everyone the same ad.   But increasingly we can choose different ads for different people.  And  that means we can get much better results for television advertising.  And  I think that gives people a real alternative, where on digital advertising  right now YouTube has a huge monopoly of digital.  But don't forget that's  a small subset of all of the advertising that these big marketers are  spending.  So, it looks like a lot of digital but as we see T.V. come  towards this, we're going to see a very, very different landscape.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you need to figure out a better way to connect the viewer  and the customer with the actual buying opportunity which is what Instagram  which is owned by Facebook does so brilliantly.  It's like they show you  something and it's like click on this to click on this ad and you can  purchase it immediately literally with your finger, and your thumb print on  your iPhone.  So, again that that's the challenge for traditional  advertising.  Even if the video is delivered on this device.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then they can measure all of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They measure it all and then that's what the advertisers want.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, really important conversation.  Brian, thank you.   Thank you so much.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brian O'Kelly, joining us there, AppNexus.</p><p>Coming up, Alexa for kids.  The new way Amazon is helping to teach your  children manners.  Then keeping kids safe on the web YouTube rules out  improved parental controls as well.  Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, the European Central Bank has left interest  rates unchanged as expected.  We're waiting on Mario Draghi and his press  conference within the next hour to see if he has -- will reveal anything  else about stimulus.  No change in market action.  This in fact was  expected.  </p><p>Meanwhile there's this, Amazon is releasing a kid-friendly Echo Dot with  parental controls.  Alexa may already be listening in.  Gerri Willis, with  the details now, Gerri.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, she is listening in.  And  don't forget that.  But I'm a big fan.  And if you're worried about Alexa's  smart voice assistance eavesdropping on your conversations, well you  probably should be concerned and here's why.  By exploiting a coding error  in Alexa's skills, the researchers found a way to get the device to  continue listening even long after the software was activated.  </p><p>Amazon said it's fixed this problem.  But I have to tell you, she's  listening in on what you're saying.  And now Alexa may help you raise your  kids.  You're seeing the products right here.  It's the new Echo Dot for  kids.  They encase it in rubber basically and they put special content on  it just for kids.  Now, $79.99 is the original price for this.  </p><p>But if you want to buy the souped up version of this over time, you can get  access to audio books, radio stations, just for kids, Disney content,  Nickelodeon and National Geographic content, that will cost you extra after  the first year, $2.99 a month per kid and of course we've seen Google,  YouTube struggle with this very issue.  They have an app for kids that  hasn't worked very well and they're trying to make improvements to that.   But the kids Amazon feature is so interesting because they're trying to get  people to talk nice to Alexa.  So, if children say please, then they get  rewarded for it.  They're told (INAUDIBLE) thank you very much for that,  for speaking nicely to me.  And I hear that the real concern about this  isn't are you being nice to Alexa.  The real concern was Alexa is always a  woman's voice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  So, they didn't want people -- kids learning to be nasty to women.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- I can't believe this, that they're listening even  when you don't know that they're listening.  This is an incredibly story  Gerri, really.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to leave it there.  Because we have breaking news.  We  want to talk to you about this.  Dr. Ronny Jackson is pulling out of the  race for the V.A. Secretary.  Pete Hegseth, we are just getting this news.   Dagen, you saw it crossing.  Anything else?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is the reporting --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronny Jackson.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is reporting from John Roberts, the Chief White House  Correspondent at the FOX News Channel.  But I think that this was expected,  was it not?  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes, I mean, as of last night it looked like it was likely, too  much stuff had come out.  And people didn't know if it was verified or not.   He was denying most of it.  It was a quick pick from this president as well  from a guy he truly respected with a -- with a proven record in the  military and as a doctor in the White House through to multiple  administrations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH:  I mean, he got a lot of praise from the Obama folks as well.  Too  much, too fast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was these revelation that were put out, and quite frankly  when I put on Twitter, you know, it's an insult to snakes to call  Washington, D.C. A snake pit, that all of this information started coming  out in the press about allegations of drinking on the job, of pill  prescribing, questionable practices prescribing medication to people within  the White House.  I just thought it was deeply unfortunate.  And I don't  know why anybody -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's deeply unfortunate.  But apparently, there was a trip that  only a small cabal of people in the Obama administration was on and now we  understand that this is getting out.  I mean, it's really unfortunate what  the previous administration is doing to this current administration in  terms of leaks, in terms of trying hard to put all these barriers up in  place.  I actually think it's disgusting.  I mean it's a -- but it feels  like that's the only way this information could have gotten out.  That's  why I bring this up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it does show what a nasty town Washington can be.  And  also, the oddity of this story is this is not a nominee who came from  somewhere else and these reports come out.  This is someone that is -- the  president has been working with closely, that the previous president worked  with closely.  You had a lot of people on the record from both parties  saying this is a solid citizen, a great colleague, and so to now have off  the record --</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- allegations.  Contrary to what the president and his  predecessor have said they witnessed, I find it just beyond bizarre that  this is what takes down a nominee.  But that's the culture we live in now.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  No, go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, there and -- you can speak to this.  There are great  entrenched interests.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the way that the veterans administration operates, in terms  of the way that money is doled out.  So, if they think, these interests  think that somebody's going to come in and change the status quo in terms  of who gets the money and how much then --</p><p>HEGSETH:  The veterans industrial complex is powerful.  This guy was --  this president wants to shake it up.  He would have as well.  He never got  his encore.  He never got his confirmation hearing, said it was rumor and  innuendo which is incredibly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's so awful.  Why didn't Obama fire him?  And why has President  Trump had such a good working experience with him?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a cabal that wants to destroy Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they want chaos around him.  Your name has been floated out  there.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes, it has.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you want the job?  </p><p>HEGSETH:  If the president asked me to serve, great.  But he hasn't at this  point.  So, we'll see.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The NFL draft kicks off tonight on FOX as new  technology is helping players put their best foot forward.  Cheryl Casone  with all the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  About the foot Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  There you go.  NFL draft day is here, and as young athletes are  preparing to enter the league, the NFL is looking at new ways to protect  them.  So, I went down to the New York Giants training facility to find out  how a partnership with H.P. is helping them stay one step ahead of injury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  It's one of the biggest risks of playing in the NFL, injury.  But  it's not just concussions that take players out of the game.  With nearly  two-thirds of football injuries occurring in the lower limbs, the shoes  athletes wear can determine a team's fate.  </p><p>LEIGH WEISS, DIRECTOR OF REHABILITATION, NEW YORK GIANTS:  Shoes are no  longer seen as a piece of apparel.  You know, they're a piece of protective  equipment.  </p><p>CASONE:  Here at the New York Giants training facility, they are using  this.  Technology from H.P. with 3D scanning that creates digital profiles  of players' feet.  </p><p>JOE SKIBA, EQUIPMENT DIRECTOR, NEW YORK GIANTS:  It's taking your foot,  it's taking your length, it's taking your width.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.</p><p>SKIBA:  So, one of the most important things in today's game is players  safety.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>SKIBA:  So, the first thing we want to do is we want to take a scan and  make sure he's actually wearing the exact footwear he should be wearing to  perform on the field.  </p><p>CASONE:  Quarterback Davis Webb showed me how it all works.  </p><p>DAVIS WEBB, QUARTERBACK, NEW YORK GIANTS:  Your right foot is a -- is a  little bigger.</p><p>CASONE:  OK, your right arch is bigger than your left.  So, you do need  custom shoes?  </p><p>Turned out, he needed the equipment more than he thought.  </p><p>SKIBA:  So, we're going to put the recommendation right here.  </p><p>WEBB:  That's what I wear.  </p><p>CASONE:  Is this right?</p><p>SKIBA:  Actually, this is not -- this is actually not a set-up.  This is  actually the cleat that Davis actually wears.  </p><p>CASONE:  H.P. technology puts million-dollar players together with high end  shoes from Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, boosting performance and health.  </p><p>RON COUGHLIN, PRESIDENT, H.P. PERSONAL SYSTEMS:  There's probably no shoe  that has more pressure than a 300-pound linemen on a cleat.  And so, having  the best fit for them and the support, they probably have the highest need  in the world.  So, it was a great place for us to test our technology.  </p><p>CASONE:  Every player from all 32 NFL teams are being scanned for this  season.  </p><p>JENNIFER LANGTON, VICE PRESIDENT, NFL HEALTH AND SAFETY:  We can help bring  innovation to the space, i.e.  You know, the H.P. fit scanner, so they are  in the best cleat available for themselves.  </p><p>CASONE:  And the Giants are hoping their partnership with H.P. will give  them a shoe-in to the Super Bowl.  </p><p>WEISS:  So, at the end of the day, you know, the healthy football teams are  usually more successful football teams and that's -- and that's what we  started for.  </p><p>CASONE:  So, a healthy team is a winning team?  </p><p>WEISS:  Yes, that's what keeps me up at night.  </p><p>CASONE:  And since I'm a runner, I had to try it.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Wow, you have a big width difference.  Do you know that?  </p><p>CASONE:  No.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Really?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, look at that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  But you did come up with two cleats.</p><p>COUGHLIN:  In case, you are going to go out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  All right, so yes, I learned a few things about my own feet as  well, Maria, when I went out and shot the story.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you need custom made shoes?  </p><p>CASONE:  I need custom-made shoes.  I have a low arch on my left and a  right -- a high arch on my right.  I had no clue.  I have whacky feet.  But  so are they.  So, I feel better about it.  Anyway, the draft is tonight,  we're really excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Don't forget to catch the live coverage of  the NFL draft tonight, 8:00 p.m. Eastern time.  Showtime.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Still ahead, Kanye West causes a stir again after the rapper tweets  his praise of president Trump and has a new not so kind words of former  president Obama, next hour, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it its Thursday, April 26th.  Your  top stories right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo -- happy Thursday to you.  It is Thursday, April 26th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in the driver's seat on Wall Street this morning -- that is what's  dictating stocks.  The Dow Industrials expected to be up about 50 points  right out of the gate -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  The Nasdaq  is up two-thirds of a percent right now -- that's 38 points higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology titans Amazon and Microsoft will be headlining the biggest  earnings day of the season.  Both are due out tonight after the bell.  We  will preview.</p><p>Plus Facebook shaking off the scandal -- shares soaring in the premarket,  up better than 6 percent right now after the company beat expectations  yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users and monthly users.</p><p>The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by earnings from  Boeing.  The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue --  that helped it lift the Dow up about 60 points at the close, one-half of 1  percent.  The S&amp;P was up 5 but the Nasdaq was down about three-and-a-half.</p><p>In Europe this morning here's the scoop.  We've got money moving into  stocks as well but it is a fractional move.  The FT100, the CAC 40 and the  DAX index all higher by about between a quarter of a percent and half of a  percent.  Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank -- that  decision on rates due out later this hour.  No change in interest rates  expected but we will be watching ECB president, Mario Draghi and what he  says at his live news conference about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a look.  The shanghai composite  the worst performer in China, down one and a third percent.</p><p>A Wall Street retreat -- Deutsche Bank announcing plans to slash jobs in  the United States amid falling profits.  Details on the company's sprawling  rebuilding efforts.  Deutsche Bank shares are down two-thirds of a percent  this morning.</p><p>And then child's play for Amazon -- how the technology company is teaching  Alexa new parenting tricks.</p><p>Then, we will tell you the most cringe-worthy phrases used in the office.   I think we know a couple of them.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, along with Iraq and  Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth.</p><p>Great to see everybody today.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:   Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  I wonder what those phrases are -- and how many of those have I  said on TV.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Try to think outside the box\" -- </p><p>HEGSETH:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's one of them.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Is that what it is?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's one of them.  We'll bring you all the phrases.  But there  are -- I know a phrase you hate.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tell me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Let's unpack this\".  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- you read my mind.  You read my mind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You hate that phrase, I know it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And that's kind of recent.  And you know what I also hate?   \"Nothing burger\".  I hate it -- \"nothing burger\".</p><p>HEGSETH:  I like -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not just because Hillary Clinton used it.  But it's just over- used.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  I don't like \"with all due respect\", because you know what's  coming next -- little respect.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I love that one Rickey Bobby says, but other than that, not so  much.</p><p>Great earnings -- we'll see tomorrow if the economy and the fourth full  quarter of the Trump presidency is really moving to a higher level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got the GDP out this week.  And of course, this is  the single busiest day for earnings so far.  And they have been largely  better than expected.  So we've got that profit story very much in place.   We're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>But first our top story right now.  Emmanuel Macron addressed this Congress  in a rousing speech yesterday.  The French president made the case for  staying in the Iran nuclear deal, saying that the U.S. and France can work  together to forge a more comprehensive agreement that ultimately President  Trump can come to accept.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT:  As for Iran, our objective is clear.   Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons -- not now, not in five years,  not in 10 years, never.</p><p>This agreement may not address all concerns, but we should not abandon it  without having something substantial and more substantial instead.  That's  my position.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But later in the day, when speaking with reporters, Macron  conceded that he believes the President will exit the Iran deal, quote,  \"for domestic reasons\" and that of course, the deadline is next month.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about that is a member of the House Armed Services  Committee, Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California.   Congressman -- it's good to see you.  And thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA), HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Good morning.   Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your take on both of these statements from the French  president.  We know that the President -- President Trump has until May  12th to decide whether or not to renew that Iran deal.  Your takeaway?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  He's right and I hope he's wrong.  He's absolutely right -- we  have to stay in it.  The JCPOA gives us the very best opportunity we have  to prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon.  Certainly for the next  decade, probably the next two decades, that agreement will prevent them  from having a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The second point, will the President back away from it?  I hope not.  It  would be a very, very serious mistake for a variety of reasons.</p><p>One, it would pull the United States away from key partners -- people that  we absolutely have to work with if we're going to deal with Syria and Iran  going into the future.</p><p>So let's hope that he's right on the first issue, that the JCPOA does  prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon; and secondly, that he's wrong  about what the President might do.  I think the President will recognize  the extraordinary risks to the position of the United States as a leader in  this world if he were to pull out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about changing certain areas?  I mean isn't it true that  there isn't enough opportunity to check whether or not they're being honest  in terms of what they're doing with their nuclear capabilities?  Are there  fixes that the allies can put in place to change this deal so the President  is more poised to stay in it?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Maria, you have a good point but you're slightly off the  target.  The view of what Iran is doing, that is, checking their nuclear  programs -- that's in place.</p><p>The problem is all of the other things that Iran is doing.  The Hezbollah,  the support that they're giving to Syria, the support for terrorists from  around the entire region -- all of those things were not included in the  Iran nuclear deal.  And those indeed are problems and the President is  correct that that needs to be addressed and certainly President Macron is  also quite correct, that we need to address those issues.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that we drop or exit the nuclear deal, which actually  is working and the reviews by the international agencies as to what is  happening in Iran are quite good, they are very incursive into Iran.  So  that's not he problem.</p><p>The problem is on the other things that Iran is doing beyond the nuclear.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Congressman it's Pete Hegseth -- </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Sure.</p><p>HEGSETH:  -- but this president gave Europe an opportunity to fill some of  the holes and fixes in the deal which doesn't provide -- you may think it  does, it doesn't provide oversight, it sunsets in 10 years.  We gave them  billions of dollars.  They use it to fund terrorism.</p><p>Why do you trust that the Iranians won't after ten years, even if  everything you're saying is true will actually give up their nuclear  ambitions?  Don't we have to be harder on them and have more visibility on  enforcement?  And how in the world does the existing deal do that?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  If you get into the details of the agreement, the nuclear  agreement, there are several stages along the way.  There is a 10-year.   There's also a 20-year and then Iran has signed on for the nonnuclear  proliferation treaty which is forever more into the future.  In other  words, they have committed to not engage in nuclear weapons activities in  the future.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Do you trust them?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Of course, we don't trust them.  That's why we have these  verification programs in place which are very, very intrusive.  And there  are many mechanisms to determine if in fact they begin 10 years, 15 years,  20 years out in the future to restart their nuclear program.  All of those  remain in place.</p><p>But there really is a very major concern, correctly stated by the  President, as well as by President Macron and others, that the other  activities that Iran has engaged in, particularly what we're seeing in  Syria right now, they are one of the major supporters of the Syrian -- of  the Assad government in Syria and they have perhaps thousands of troops in  Syria supporting the Syrian government and also working with Hezbollah,  threatening Israel and certainly having a major impact on Lebanon.</p><p>So all those things are concerns; they need to be dealt with.  France -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how are they going to be dealt?  How are they going to be  dealt with if the President renews it and doesn't pull out?</p><p>I mean you're saying two things.  You said it's working.  You said the Iran  deal is working.  And then you said all of this stuff that they're doing --  dealing with Syria, supporting Hezbollah, threatening Israel -- so it's not  working.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  No.  Maria -- that is not correct.  The deal did not deal with  those -- those issues that you just stated.  It dealt with the nuclear  thing.  It did not deal with the other issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  And there -- and some -- many people believe that the deal was  not whole, it didn't cover everything and that's absolutely correct, it  didn't cover everything.  And that's absolutely correct.  It did not cover  everything.  It dealt with what was and remains today the most important  and that is that -- and President Macron said this very clearly -- Iran  will never have a nuclear weapon.  That's what the deal dealt with.</p><p>It didn't deal with the other activities, malicious and bad as they are.   We should be dealing with those and if we work together and we don't dump  the nuclear deal, which would create enormous division within the coalition  that actually brought about the nuclear deal, if we don't dump that, then  we will have a strong coalition to deal with these other issues rather than  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman -- James Freeman here with the \"Journal\".  I'm  wondering, therefore, if you then support bringing back the sanctions that  were relieved by the deal as punishment for everything you just described  in terms of funding terrorism?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, there are other sanctions that are still in place,  additional sanctions may be necessary and they are always available to us  going into the future.  That's quite possible.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Does that mean you're not supporting them now?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  We need to work together with other countries.  Right now, all  of the focus is on the President threatening to dump the nuclear deal,  which would set all of this thing back and not allow us to move forward on  anything.  So that's the first problem.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I know but you just detailed all of their offenses in the region.   Doesn't that justify bringing sanctions?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  It could, and we need to be working with our allies on this  issue.  Some of those sanctions are a direct problem to our allies and that  -- and to the United States.</p><p>For example, there's a major deal that has been cut, Iran wants to purchase  dozens if not hundreds of new airliners.  That's a big deal for the airbus  and quite possibly for Boeing.  And so as you look at those sanctions, you  want to be careful to only use sanctions that are detrimental to Iran, not  detrimental to the interest of the coalition partners.</p><p>So what I'm saying is that sanctions are there.  They can be used.  But  just to go back and to put all of those back in place may create additional  problems and not achieve the goal.</p><p>So look at this thing carefully.  Use sanctions that are very targeted,  that do put the appropriate pressure on Iran so that they will back away  from many of the things.</p><p>But let me also put one more issue on the table and that is when the  President said three weeks ago that we had completed the work on ISIS, he  wanted to pull out the troops out of Syria, and that he wanted to leave  Syria to others.</p><p>Well, it turns out that the others are Russia, Iran, Turkey, and the Gulf  States.  That creates an enormous vacuum of power that will be filled by  Iran and that's not where we want to go.  So you have to look at this thing  in its total complexity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  And if we do, I think we can make progress, keep the nuclear  deal in place.  It is working and it will work for many years into the  future.</p><p>And secondly, make sure that we do apply the appropriate pressure.  Keep in  mind, Syria in this entire equation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Dagen -- did you want to say something?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I just -- Congressman, you said look at the complete deal  and all that's going on in its entirety.  The problem that a lot of  Americans have with that nuclear deal with Iran in the first place is we  handed $1.7 billion in pallets of cash to Iran.  Where is that money going  as a state sponsor of terrorism?</p><p>It's going to fund terrorist attacks.  It's going to fund Hezbollah.  So  you can't really separate those two.  We gave them the money before there  was any evidence that they were really pulling back on the nuclear program.   We actually -- we flew it to Iran in the secret of night.  And the only  reason we even know about it is because of the reporting of the \"Wall  Street Journal\".  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, that coffee has been spilled.  That coffee's no longer in  the cup.  So what do we do going forward?  The nuclear deal is in place and  it is working.  That's a good thing.  That's a very, very important thing.   Now, let's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You keep saying it's working -- Congressman.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But all of these things that are not working are so obvious.   And then a moment ago you said we have to be careful because Iran's going  to buy all these jets, possibly from Boeing and from others and we have to  be careful about that.</p><p>What's our goal?  Is our goal to stop the nuclear capability or get  business for Boeing and the jet makers?  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, you're quite correct, our goal was to stop the nuclear  capability.  And that is happening.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is that happening if they're supporting Syria?  They're  supporting Hezbollah.  They're threatening Israel.  And they're using the  $1.7 billion that we sent over there to do just that.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  Calm down for a second and carefully take a listen to what you  just said.  The nuclear deal -- that was what we dealt with.  The JCPOA was  about Iran building a nuclear weapon and at that time -- </p><p>HEGSETH:  They're still building missiles -- Congressman.  They're still  testing and building missiles, delivery systems for nuclear capabilities.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Hang on a second.  I want you to be very, very careful about  what we're talking about here.  Iran was on the cusp of actually building a  nuclear weapon.  They could have built one within one year, maybe less than  one year.  That's no longer the case.  They do not now have the materials  or the systems to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  That's what the JCPOA was about.  These other issues were not  part of that deal.  The important -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that was not smart.  That was not smart.  </p><p>GARAMENDI:  -- the important -- excuse me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, maybe so.  But I want you to understand Iran does not  have a nuclear weapon.  If they did have a nuclear weapon and all these  other things were going on, where would we be?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's the bottom line.  Congressman it's good to see  you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for (INAUDIBLE) it all out.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the news keeps getting worse for Deutsche Bank -- a  stunning first quarter loss for the company.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on it and details right now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Oh man, Maria -- yes. </p><p>We're watching shares of Deutsche Bank this morning, very closely.  Net  income for the first quarter tumbled nearly 80 percent.  That is leading  the bank to cut jobs in the investment bank as well as Deutsche Bank saying  that they're going to focus investment banking on serving core European  clients.</p><p>They're going to reduce commitments to the U.S. and Asia.  These results  are Deutsche Bank's first since they ousted chief executive John Cryan back  on April 8th.</p><p>So here we go.  The stock is actually -- it's actually doing a little bit  better than it was earlier, we should say.  It's now down a little more  than a half a percent.  But again, some pressure on this stock today --  coming back a little bit.</p><p>All right.  Subway is planning to close 500 stores in the U.S. this year.   This is after the company announced a turnaround plan requiring franchise  owners to invest more in operations and this is also on the back of Subway  facing intense competition from rivals like McDonald's and Starbucks.   Subway's U.S. sales dropped more than 4 percent last year.  so another  stock to watch today.</p><p>Well, the European space agency has released the largest map of our galaxy  ever.  And it contains more than a billion stars -- it's actually really  cool.  The 360-degree map was compiled by the Guya Project over the last  few years.  It displays a full quarter of our galaxy. </p><p>It took photos from opposite sides of our planet's orbit to pinpoint each  star's exact locations.  The public release of this new map expected to  keep scientists and astronomers really busy studying stars for years to  come.  They're very excited about this.</p><p>And then there is this, a new study taking a look at cringe-worthy office  phrases.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get out of here.  I think I'm going to lose it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Even though it's Thursday, maybe we do.  All right.  Researchers  say seven in ten Americans confess to saying such things as \"think outside  the box\" or perhaps \"give 110 percent\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mentioned that earlier.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There is no more than 100 percent.  Just saying that -- I didn't  even know that.</p><p>CASONE:  No.  There's more.  \"Hammer it out\".  Who likes that one, right?   \"Run this up the flag pole\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I hate that one.  </p><p>CASONE:  \"Throw them under the bus\".  And this could be a \"win-win  situation\".  How many times have you heard that one -- Maria and Dagen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  I've heard it a few times.</p><p>HEGSETH:  I find this corporation specific stuff to be the worst.  One is  with a group that said we're not going to call them meetings anymore.   We're going to call them \"knowledge shares\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>HEGSETH:  We're going to get together and do \"knowledge shares\".  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Knowledge shares\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Knowledge shares\".  That's hilarious.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is that (INAUDIBLE) run by a thought leader?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one more all men to avoid -- \"calm down\".  When you tell a  woman who is winning an argument with you to calm down -- generally stay  away from that.  We're going to hand you your business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, was I not calm?  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Of course, you were calm.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think he didn't like the content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was calmly pushing back, saying no, I disagree, the Iran deal  stinks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called passion and accuracy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.</p><p>Speaking of Wall Street debuts, Sonos reportedly preparing an IPO -- could  come as soon as June.  We're going to check that out.</p><p>And then Alexa is now teaching etiquette.  Amazon's smart assistant now  made to encourage kids to say \"please\" and \"thank you\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The return of the trading desk -- according to the Wall Street journal U.S.  banks are having their best year for trading revenue since the financial  crisis because of the rise in volatility.</p><p>Joining us this morning Thomas H. Lee Partners co-president Scott Sperling.   Scott -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>SCOTT SPERLING, CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H. LEE PARTNERS:  Thank you -- Maria.   Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you see the growth right now?  Tell us about your  investing and how you're allocating capital -- Scott.  </p><p>SPERLING:  Well, I think the areas that people have been looking at are  ones where there's stronger secular growth trends and the entire health  care sector is one where that continues to be an interesting opportunity,  particularly in areas where you can help bend the cost curve, be able to  provide high quality services with a more cost efficient delivery  mechanism.</p><p>Another area is obviously the entire technology world offers significant  subsectors of opportunity.  The software area has been one that has been  incredibly popular.</p><p>One of the things that we always have to do is measure the secular growth  against the pricing it takes to buy those kinds of companies and I think  having a reasonable amount of discipline in today's world will be rewarded  long-term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing that both on the public side and on the private  side?  We started the conversation talking about the return of the trading  desk because of an increase in volatility.</p><p>Do you see that -- those growth areas both on the public side as well as  private side, which is what you're doing obviously, private investing?  </p><p>SPERLING:  Yes.  I think these areas are ones that will account for a  bigger and bigger percentage of the economic activity in the country,  regardless of whether you're looking at companies that are still private or  on the public side.  So I think these are areas that will be interesting in  both the public market as well as the private markets.</p><p>The ability of investors in today's public market to buy these companies at  multiples that look something like 16 to 17 times, down from probably 19 to  20 times, could be reasonably attractive.  The fundamentals that we see in  the economy right now continue to be relatively strong.</p><p>I think it's not unreasonable to expect 3 percent GDP growth.  I think when  you combine that with the stimulus and some of that's coming from the  stimulus of the tax cut, but combine it with the longer term impact of the  stimulus with the tax cut, you can see this playing out for a longer  duration than we ever would have thought when you look at the tenor of this  recovery period.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Question, James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\",  question on interest rates.</p><p>SPERLING:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Some people get a little nervous when the yield on the 10-year  treasury note hits 3 percent.  As you know, we've had a lot of good years  with that level -- good years for the economy, for the stock market.  But  I'm wondering what it means for you and your ability to do deals.  Where do  you get nervous in terms of that interest rate's going up or that number on  the 10-year going up?  </p><p>SPERLING:  Sure.  That is clearly part of the equation that we look at.  We  want to be in a world where the coverage ratios of our obligations is  reasonably high.  We never return to that '06 to '07 period when the  coverage ratios had gotten well below 1.5x -- 1.5 times.</p><p>So as you look at the cost of debt, that comes into the calculation of what  we're willing to pay for companies.  Three percent as you point out is  actually a relatively attractive rate when you look long-term at where  those rates have been.</p><p>Oftentimes in our history it's been closer to 5 percent but certainly it's  much higher than -- it's probably a hundred basis points higher than we  have gotten used to over the last few years.  So it has some impact on the  value that will own the paper (ph) companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott -- what's your take on technology here?  I mean smart  speaker maker Sonos is reportedly going public.  The \"Journal\" first  reporting that the IPO could value the company as high as $3 billion.  Your  thoughts on the IPO landscape and where you see technology opportunities  today.  </p><p>SPERLING:  The markets will fall in and out of love obviously with any kind  of company and certainly the technology sector has benefited when you look  at the so-called FANG stocks and the impact that that has had in terms of  the growth of the equity market values.  It's been reasonably overwhelming.</p><p>So technology, because it does have significant secular growth in an  economy where growth has been hard has been very popular.  I think the  applicability of technology to everything we do in our lives, so Sonos for  example has certainly made it easier to have audio that has a diverse  number of sources available to people in their homes.  That kind of  technology is one that will scale very well in the consumer market and  people will pay for that.</p><p>Now, what you have to look at is what the nature of the competition will be  over time.  And while the overall market for that type of product, that  functionality will continue to grow very strongly and everyone will  evaluate the specific competitors within that to see what kind of share  that they will have Sonos clearly has benefited from the one of the early  drivers of this trend and this technology -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SPERLING:  -- and you see that, I think in the expected value I think they  want for the IPO.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We're talking about the Wall Street trading desk doing so well  and also about Deutsche Bank not doing well. You know, there are a lot of  these big U.S. banks that keep complaining that if regulators here demand,  they hold too much capital.  It'll be a big disadvantage versus their  overseas competitors and yet the U.S. banks seem to be crushing it versus  their international competition.</p><p>SPERLING:  Yes, they sure do.  I think you have -- look, you have smart  people across the industry, I can't comment on Deutsche Bank.  The people  we deal with are on the investment banking side and been very good.  I  can't comment more broadly on D.B. but the banks have adapted very well to  the new rules that have dramatically reduced the leverage ratios at our  commercial banking system.  </p><p>So, whereas in zero six zero seven you were looking at 20 to 30 times  leverage.  You know, today you're really looking at 10 to 12 times  leverage.  So, the ROE, the return on their equity is not going to be as  good as it was then but they've adapted very well to that.  You see Goldman  for example, Lloyd Blankfein has been out there talking about the consumer  opportunity that Goldman has, and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPERLING:  -- markets has been a major effort for them to provide a set of  services to the consumer market.  So, they are looking at new areas of  growth and at the same time, they continue to have very, very smart people  who are very helpful to people like us, who are looking to them for  financing and M&amp;A advice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  Goldman's trying to get it -- is into  the retail market.  Blackstone Group into the retail market.  Scott, good  to see you sir.  </p><p>SPERLING:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Scott Sperling. ( CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H.  LEE PARTNERS )</p><p>SPERLING:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning.</p><p>SPERLING:  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.  Coming up technology earnings blitz, Amazon,  Microsoft, Intel all set to report results \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.  We're  breaking down what to expect.</p><p>Then policing your kids, watching the web.  Google now updating its YouTube  Kids app, to improve parental controls.  Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday April 26th.   Your top stories right now 07:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the single  busiest day for first quarter earnings today.  General Motors and Southwest  Airlines among the companies reporting this morning.  G.M. beat  expectations while Southwest was mixed.  There's a look at the stocks both  under pressure today.  G.M. down 2-1/2 percent, Southwest down 3-1/2  percent.  </p><p>Investors are also waiting on big tech.  AmazonIntel and Microsoft all  reporting their quarter after the close tonight.  Checking the broader  markets this morning while we see those stocks trading up and the broader  market up as well.  The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday and  the momentum continues this morning up 40 points on the Dow right now. </p><p>Boeing was a big earnings beat yesterday.  That stock was strong and that  lifted the Dow.  Up about 60 points at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up  about five, but the Nasdaq was under selling crasher finishing lower by 3- 1/2.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are trading up.  FT-100 CAC Quarante and the  DAX Index are higher.  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, the  others are fractionally moving, but in the plus column.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the ECB decision, the European Central Bank news  is going to be out in about 15 minutes.  No change in rate expected.  But  we are watching the ECB President Mario Draghi during his news conference  and what he says about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed.  China was the weak spot.  The  Shanghai Composite down one and a third percent.  </p><p>Big technology is now targeting kids.  Amazon and YouTube making changes so  that parents can breathe a sigh of relief, will tell you about it.  And  then it's NFL draft day.  We're taking a look at the technology that's  helping prevent player injuries.  All that coming up.  </p><p>But first this, technology earnings Blitz.  Tech giants Amazon, Microsoft  and Intel all do out \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.  </p><p>Meanwhile Facebook and Alphabet both beating expectations this week.  The  two technology darlings posted a spike in digital ad dollars accounting for  91 percent of Facebook's revenue and 97 percent of Google parent company  revenue.  That could give us some information about Amazon, because Amazon  will also report ad revenue with its prime business tonight.  Joining us  right now is AppNexus CEO, Brian O'Kelley.  Brian, good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRIAN O'KELLEY, CEO, APPNEXUS:  Thanks for having me </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have a great read on advertising revenue.  Explain  AppNexus and tell us what you're seeing in ad revenue right now.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  All right.  So, AppNexus is the technology that helps companies  who aren't Facebook get as much money for their content as possible.  So,  if you -- if you're watching FOX Business right now, you're seeing ads.   Who decides what ads you see?  Well, for many of the companies who aren't  Facebook, that's app Nexus.  We're trying to use machine learning and non- personal information to figure out which ads are the most effective to  serve to all the consumers watching T.V. or reading articles on the web.   So, that's what we do.  </p><p>Now the big challenge in advertising right now, is that if your Facebook or  Google you have an immense amount of data about consumers that they've --  in many cases freely given, and you can use that to micro-target ads.  But  of course, that also means that the consumer is the product.  You're  effectively selling the consumer their own data and monetizing that as you  see in these earnings incredibly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly and that's what kept them in trouble.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Indeed.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Do you -- and you can avoid that  because you're not holding anyone's personal data.  You don't have the  Facebook problem of how do I protect your privacy.  Is that right?</p><p>O'KELLEY:  That's correct.  Of course, we have the opposite problem which  is that we don't know who you are.  And so, we have to use these macro  techniques to figure out what ads you'll probably like if you're watching  this show or if you're reading that article.  But we don't know who you  are.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, like we've seen in some recent years, Facebook and Alphabet,  Google's parent capturing almost all the growth or all the growth in online  advertising.  I believe in mobile advertising.  Is that trend changing?  </p><p>O'KELLEY:  Well, I think this last quarter we saw that decline a little  bit.  So, Google's share went down a little.  So, we're starting to see  that change. I think the biggest challenge is that if consumers continue to  want to go to Facebook or see videos on YouTube that's where the  advertisers are going to go.  So, the challenge is if you're any other  media company or content producer, how do you get the consumers to spend  less time on Facebook or spend less time on YouTube?</p><p>HEGSETH:  So, I mean that was part of the criticism of Facebook is there a  monopoly effectively in a particular space.  Do you anticipate competitors  then?  Would that would create that opportunity for other advertisers?</p><p>O'KELLEY:  I'd love to see competitors.  When you have a consumer backlash  against Facebook, people were very upset with Facebook and yet where do you  go?  You know? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Tweet? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That goes -- that goes to what Sheryl Sandberg said on the call  yesterday that they haven't had seen a meaningful trend of advertisers  fleeing the platform.  It was a little strange because there was so much  advertiser outrage at YouTube when they found -- the advertisers found out  that their commercials were appearing and videos of questionable, if not  repugnant content.  But this, it's like, as long as the advertisers  attitude seems to be, as long as this benefits us we don't really care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, and as a P.R. move they have this latest apology, a  promising to keep data safe.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But then something happened we had to deal with spam,  clickbait, fake news and data misuse.  That's going to change.</p><p>From now on, Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your  privacy.  So we can all get back to what made Facebook good in the first  place, friends.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that enough?  I mean the stock is up today after the strong  quarterly results because people are saying well maybe this didn't matter  to investors and advertisers.  </p><p>O'KELLEY:  I think it matters a ton.  I mean, when I talk to the largest  advertisers in the world they say consistently, I want an alternative to  YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  OK.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  I don't want to spend my money there but that's where people  were spending all their time.  So, I think the biggest challenge is really  that, you can delete Facebook.  And I wish you would because (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if you can delete it.  We were hearing that people  try to delete the app and they couldn't.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's like impossible to get rid of Facebook</p><p>O'KELLEY:  That's a monopoly.  So, what are we going to do?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's this is obviously a product that a lot of consumers have  freely chosen to this point.  But this is interesting that you're hearing  from advertisers that they would like new options.  Because you look at  these earnings reports 50 percent growth in the ad revenue at Facebook.   They're still writing and increasingly writing checks even if they seem to  want more options.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Yes, well one thing to think about is that as television becomes  more and more digital so, people cut the cord and we can actually do more  intelligent ad insertion into T.V.  Broadcast we show everyone the same ad.   But increasingly we can choose different ads for different people.  And  that means we can get much better results for television advertising.  And  I think that gives people a real alternative, where on digital advertising  right now YouTube has a huge monopoly of digital.  But don't forget that's  a small subset of all of the advertising that these big marketers are  spending.  So, it looks like a lot of digital but as we see T.V. come  towards this, we're going to see a very, very different landscape.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you need to figure out a better way to connect the viewer  and the customer with the actual buying opportunity which is what Instagram  which is owned by Facebook does so brilliantly.  It's like they show you  something and it's like click on this to click on this ad and you can  purchase it immediately literally with your finger, and your thumb print on  your iPhone.  So, again that that's the challenge for traditional  advertising.  Even if the video is delivered on this device.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then they can measure all of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They measure it all and then that's what the advertisers want.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, really important conversation.  Brian, thank you.   Thank you so much.</p><p>O'KELLEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brian O'Kelly, joining us there, AppNexus.</p><p>Coming up, Alexa for kids.  The new way Amazon is helping to teach your  children manners.  Then keeping kids safe on the web YouTube rules out  improved parental controls as well.  Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, the European Central Bank has left interest  rates unchanged as expected.  We're waiting on Mario Draghi and his press  conference within the next hour to see if he has -- will reveal anything  else about stimulus.  No change in market action.  This in fact was  expected.  </p><p>Meanwhile there's this, Amazon is releasing a kid-friendly Echo Dot with  parental controls.  Alexa may already be listening in.  Gerri Willis, with  the details now, Gerri.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, she is listening in.  And  don't forget that.  But I'm a big fan.  And if you're worried about Alexa's  smart voice assistance eavesdropping on your conversations, well you  probably should be concerned and here's why.  By exploiting a coding error  in Alexa's skills, the researchers found a way to get the device to  continue listening even long after the software was activated.  </p><p>Amazon said it's fixed this problem.  But I have to tell you, she's  listening in on what you're saying.  And now Alexa may help you raise your  kids.  You're seeing the products right here.  It's the new Echo Dot for  kids.  They encase it in rubber basically and they put special content on  it just for kids.  Now, $79.99 is the original price for this.  </p><p>But if you want to buy the souped up version of this over time, you can get  access to audio books, radio stations, just for kids, Disney content,  Nickelodeon and National Geographic content, that will cost you extra after  the first year, $2.99 a month per kid and of course we've seen Google,  YouTube struggle with this very issue.  They have an app for kids that  hasn't worked very well and they're trying to make improvements to that.   But the kids Amazon feature is so interesting because they're trying to get  people to talk nice to Alexa.  So, if children say please, then they get  rewarded for it.  They're told (INAUDIBLE) thank you very much for that,  for speaking nicely to me.  And I hear that the real concern about this  isn't are you being nice to Alexa.  The real concern was Alexa is always a  woman's voice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  So, they didn't want people -- kids learning to be nasty to women.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- I can't believe this, that they're listening even  when you don't know that they're listening.  This is an incredibly story  Gerri, really.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to leave it there.  Because we have breaking news.  We  want to talk to you about this.  Dr. Ronny Jackson is pulling out of the  race for the V.A. Secretary.  Pete Hegseth, we are just getting this news.   Dagen, you saw it crossing.  Anything else?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is the reporting --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronny Jackson.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is reporting from John Roberts, the Chief White House  Correspondent at the FOX News Channel.  But I think that this was expected,  was it not?  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes, I mean, as of last night it looked like it was likely, too  much stuff had come out.  And people didn't know if it was verified or not.   He was denying most of it.  It was a quick pick from this president as well  from a guy he truly respected with a -- with a proven record in the  military and as a doctor in the White House through to multiple  administrations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH:  I mean, he got a lot of praise from the Obama folks as well.  Too  much, too fast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was these revelation that were put out, and quite frankly  when I put on Twitter, you know, it's an insult to snakes to call  Washington, D.C. A snake pit, that all of this information started coming  out in the press about allegations of drinking on the job, of pill  prescribing, questionable practices prescribing medication to people within  the White House.  I just thought it was deeply unfortunate.  And I don't  know why anybody -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's deeply unfortunate.  But apparently, there was a trip that  only a small cabal of people in the Obama administration was on and now we  understand that this is getting out.  I mean, it's really unfortunate what  the previous administration is doing to this current administration in  terms of leaks, in terms of trying hard to put all these barriers up in  place.  I actually think it's disgusting.  I mean it's a -- but it feels  like that's the only way this information could have gotten out.  That's  why I bring this up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it does show what a nasty town Washington can be.  And  also, the oddity of this story is this is not a nominee who came from  somewhere else and these reports come out.  This is someone that is -- the  president has been working with closely, that the previous president worked  with closely.  You had a lot of people on the record from both parties  saying this is a solid citizen, a great colleague, and so to now have off  the record --</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- allegations.  Contrary to what the president and his  predecessor have said they witnessed, I find it just beyond bizarre that  this is what takes down a nominee.  But that's the culture we live in now.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  No, go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, there and -- you can speak to this.  There are great  entrenched interests.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the way that the veterans administration operates, in terms  of the way that money is doled out.  So, if they think, these interests  think that somebody's going to come in and change the status quo in terms  of who gets the money and how much then --</p><p>HEGSETH:  The veterans industrial complex is powerful.  This guy was --  this president wants to shake it up.  He would have as well.  He never got  his encore.  He never got his confirmation hearing, said it was rumor and  innuendo which is incredibly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's so awful.  Why didn't Obama fire him?  And why has President  Trump had such a good working experience with him?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a cabal that wants to destroy Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they want chaos around him.  Your name has been floated out  there.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes, it has.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you want the job?  </p><p>HEGSETH:  If the president asked me to serve, great.  But he hasn't at this  point.  So, we'll see.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The NFL draft kicks off tonight on FOX as new  technology is helping players put their best foot forward.  Cheryl Casone  with all the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  About the foot Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  There you go.  NFL draft day is here, and as young athletes are  preparing to enter the league, the NFL is looking at new ways to protect  them.  So, I went down to the New York Giants training facility to find out  how a partnership with H.P. is helping them stay one step ahead of injury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  It's one of the biggest risks of playing in the NFL, injury.  But  it's not just concussions that take players out of the game.  With nearly  two-thirds of football injuries occurring in the lower limbs, the shoes  athletes wear can determine a team's fate.  </p><p>LEIGH WEISS, DIRECTOR OF REHABILITATION, NEW YORK GIANTS:  Shoes are no  longer seen as a piece of apparel.  You know, they're a piece of protective  equipment.  </p><p>CASONE:  Here at the New York Giants training facility, they are using  this.  Technology from H.P. with 3D scanning that creates digital profiles  of players' feet.  </p><p>JOE SKIBA, EQUIPMENT DIRECTOR, NEW YORK GIANTS:  It's taking your foot,  it's taking your length, it's taking your width.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.</p><p>SKIBA:  So, one of the most important things in today's game is players  safety.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>SKIBA:  So, the first thing we want to do is we want to take a scan and  make sure he's actually wearing the exact footwear he should be wearing to  perform on the field.  </p><p>CASONE:  Quarterback Davis Webb showed me how it all works.  </p><p>DAVIS WEBB, QUARTERBACK, NEW YORK GIANTS:  Your right foot is a -- is a  little bigger.</p><p>CASONE:  OK, your right arch is bigger than your left.  So, you do need  custom shoes?  </p><p>Turned out, he needed the equipment more than he thought.  </p><p>SKIBA:  So, we're going to put the recommendation right here.  </p><p>WEBB:  That's what I wear.  </p><p>CASONE:  Is this right?</p><p>SKIBA:  Actually, this is not -- this is actually not a set-up.  This is  actually the cleat that Davis actually wears.  </p><p>CASONE:  H.P. technology puts million-dollar players together with high end  shoes from Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, boosting performance and health.  </p><p>RON COUGHLIN, PRESIDENT, H.P. PERSONAL SYSTEMS:  There's probably no shoe  that has more pressure than a 300-pound linemen on a cleat.  And so, having  the best fit for them and the support, they probably have the highest need  in the world.  So, it was a great place for us to test our technology.  </p><p>CASONE:  Every player from all 32 NFL teams are being scanned for this  season.  </p><p>JENNIFER LANGTON, VICE PRESIDENT, NFL HEALTH AND SAFETY:  We can help bring  innovation to the space, i.e.  You know, the H.P. fit scanner, so they are  in the best cleat available for themselves.  </p><p>CASONE:  And the Giants are hoping their partnership with H.P. will give  them a shoe-in to the Super Bowl.  </p><p>WEISS:  So, at the end of the day, you know, the healthy football teams are  usually more successful football teams and that's -- and that's what we  started for.  </p><p>CASONE:  So, a healthy team is a winning team?  </p><p>WEISS:  Yes, that's what keeps me up at night.  </p><p>CASONE:  And since I'm a runner, I had to try it.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Wow, you have a big width difference.  Do you know that?  </p><p>CASONE:  No.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Really?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, look at that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  But you did come up with two cleats.</p><p>COUGHLIN:  In case, you are going to go out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  All right, so yes, I learned a few things about my own feet as  well, Maria, when I went out and shot the story.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you need custom made shoes?  </p><p>CASONE:  I need custom-made shoes.  I have a low arch on my left and a  right -- a high arch on my right.  I had no clue.  I have whacky feet.  But  so are they.  So, I feel better about it.  Anyway, the draft is tonight,  we're really excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Don't forget to catch the live coverage of  the NFL draft tonight, 8:00 p.m. Eastern time.  Showtime.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Still ahead, Kanye West causes a stir again after the rapper tweets  his praise of president Trump and has a new not so kind words of former  president Obama, next hour, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it its Thursday, April 26th.

Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo -- happy Thursday to you. It is Thursday, April 26th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in the driver's seat on Wall Street this morning -- that is what's dictating stocks. The Dow Industrials expected to be up about 50 points right out of the gate -- that's a quarter of a percent higher. The Nasdaq is up two-thirds of a percent right now -- that's 38 points higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology titans Amazon and Microsoft will be headlining the biggest earnings day of the season. Both are due out tonight after the bell. We will preview.</p><p>Plus Facebook shaking off the scandal -- shares soaring in the premarket, up better than 6 percent right now after the company beat expectations yesterday and posted strong growth in daily users and monthly users.</p><p>The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by earnings from Boeing. The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue -- that helped it lift the Dow up about 60 points at the close, one-half of 1 percent. The S&amp;P was up 5 but the Nasdaq was down about three-and-a-half.</p><p>In Europe this morning here's the scoop. We've got money moving into stocks as well but it is a fractional move. The FT100, the CAC 40 and the DAX index all higher by about between a quarter of a percent and half of a percent. Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank -- that decision on rates due out later this hour. No change in interest rates expected but we will be watching ECB president, Mario Draghi and what he says at his live news conference about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a look. The shanghai composite the worst performer in China, down one and a third percent.</p><p>A Wall Street retreat -- Deutsche Bank announcing plans to slash jobs in the United States amid falling profits. Details on the company's sprawling rebuilding efforts. Deutsche Bank shares are down two-thirds of a percent this morning.</p><p>And then child's play for Amazon -- how the technology company is teaching Alexa new parenting tricks.</p><p>Then, we will tell you the most cringe-worthy phrases used in the office. I think we know a couple of them.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, along with Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth.</p><p>Great to see everybody today.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning to you.</p><p>HEGSETH: I wonder what those phrases are -- and how many of those have I said on TV.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Try to think outside the box\" --</p><p>HEGSETH: Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one of them.</p><p>HEGSETH: Is that what it is?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's one of them. We'll bring you all the phrases. But there are -- I know a phrase you hate.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Tell me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Let's unpack this\".</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes -- you read my mind. You read my mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You hate that phrase, I know it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And that's kind of recent. And you know what I also hate? \"Nothing burger\". I hate it -- \"nothing burger\".</p><p>HEGSETH: I like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not just because Hillary Clinton used it. But it's just over- used.</p><p>HEGSETH: I don't like \"with all due respect\", because you know what's coming next -- little respect.</p><p>FREEMAN: I love that one Rickey Bobby says, but other than that, not so much.</p><p>Great earnings -- we'll see tomorrow if the economy and the fourth full quarter of the Trump presidency is really moving to a higher level.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We've got the GDP out this week. And of course, this is the single busiest day for earnings so far. And they have been largely better than expected. So we've got that profit story very much in place. We're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>But first our top story right now. Emmanuel Macron addressed this Congress in a rousing speech yesterday. The French president made the case for staying in the Iran nuclear deal, saying that the U.S. and France can work together to forge a more comprehensive agreement that ultimately President Trump can come to accept.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: As for Iran, our objective is clear. Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons -- not now, not in five years, not in 10 years, never.</p><p>This agreement may not address all concerns, but we should not abandon it without having something substantial and more substantial instead. That's my position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But later in the day, when speaking with reporters, Macron conceded that he believes the President will exit the Iran deal, quote, \"for domestic reasons\" and that of course, the deadline is next month.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about that is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California. Congressman -- it's good to see you. And thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA), HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Good morning. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So your take on both of these statements from the French president. We know that the President -- President Trump has until May 12th to decide whether or not to renew that Iran deal. Your takeaway?</p><p>GARAMENDI: He's right and I hope he's wrong. He's absolutely right -- we have to stay in it. The JCPOA gives us the very best opportunity we have to prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon. Certainly for the next decade, probably the next two decades, that agreement will prevent them from having a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The second point, will the President back away from it? I hope not. It would be a very, very serious mistake for a variety of reasons.</p><p>One, it would pull the United States away from key partners -- people that we absolutely have to work with if we're going to deal with Syria and Iran going into the future.</p><p>So let's hope that he's right on the first issue, that the JCPOA does prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon; and secondly, that he's wrong about what the President might do. I think the President will recognize the extraordinary risks to the position of the United States as a leader in this world if he were to pull out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about changing certain areas? I mean isn't it true that there isn't enough opportunity to check whether or not they're being honest in terms of what they're doing with their nuclear capabilities? Are there fixes that the allies can put in place to change this deal so the President is more poised to stay in it?</p><p>GARAMENDI: Maria, you have a good point but you're slightly off the target. The view of what Iran is doing, that is, checking their nuclear programs -- that's in place.</p><p>The problem is all of the other things that Iran is doing. The Hezbollah, the support that they're giving to Syria, the support for terrorists from around the entire region -- all of those things were not included in the Iran nuclear deal. And those indeed are problems and the President is correct that that needs to be addressed and certainly President Macron is also quite correct, that we need to address those issues.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that we drop or exit the nuclear deal, which actually is working and the reviews by the international agencies as to what is happening in Iran are quite good, they are very incursive into Iran. So that's not he problem.</p><p>The problem is on the other things that Iran is doing beyond the nuclear.</p><p>HEGSETH: Congressman it's Pete Hegseth --</p><p>GARAMENDI: Sure.</p><p>HEGSETH: -- but this president gave Europe an opportunity to fill some of the holes and fixes in the deal which doesn't provide -- you may think it does, it doesn't provide oversight, it sunsets in 10 years. We gave them billions of dollars. They use it to fund terrorism.</p><p>Why do you trust that the Iranians won't after ten years, even if everything you're saying is true will actually give up their nuclear ambitions? Don't we have to be harder on them and have more visibility on enforcement? And how in the world does the existing deal do that?</p><p>GARAMENDI: If you get into the details of the agreement, the nuclear agreement, there are several stages along the way. There is a 10-year. There's also a 20-year and then Iran has signed on for the nonnuclear proliferation treaty which is forever more into the future. In other words, they have committed to not engage in nuclear weapons activities in the future.</p><p>HEGSETH: Do you trust them?</p><p>GARAMENDI: Of course, we don't trust them. That's why we have these verification programs in place which are very, very intrusive. And there are many mechanisms to determine if in fact they begin 10 years, 15 years, 20 years out in the future to restart their nuclear program. All of those remain in place.</p><p>But there really is a very major concern, correctly stated by the President, as well as by President Macron and others, that the other activities that Iran has engaged in, particularly what we're seeing in Syria right now, they are one of the major supporters of the Syrian -- of the Assad government in Syria and they have perhaps thousands of troops in Syria supporting the Syrian government and also working with Hezbollah, threatening Israel and certainly having a major impact on Lebanon.</p><p>So all those things are concerns; they need to be dealt with. France --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how are they going to be dealt? How are they going to be dealt with if the President renews it and doesn't pull out?</p><p>I mean you're saying two things. You said it's working. You said the Iran deal is working. And then you said all of this stuff that they're doing -- dealing with Syria, supporting Hezbollah, threatening Israel -- so it's not working.</p><p>GARAMENDI: No. Maria -- that is not correct. The deal did not deal with those -- those issues that you just stated. It dealt with the nuclear thing. It did not deal with the other issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>GARAMENDI: And there -- and some -- many people believe that the deal was not whole, it didn't cover everything and that's absolutely correct, it didn't cover everything. And that's absolutely correct. It did not cover everything. It dealt with what was and remains today the most important and that is that -- and President Macron said this very clearly -- Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. That's what the deal dealt with.</p><p>It didn't deal with the other activities, malicious and bad as they are. We should be dealing with those and if we work together and we don't dump the nuclear deal, which would create enormous division within the coalition that actually brought about the nuclear deal, if we don't dump that, then we will have a strong coalition to deal with these other issues rather than --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Congressman -- James Freeman here with the \"Journal\". I'm wondering, therefore, if you then support bringing back the sanctions that were relieved by the deal as punishment for everything you just described in terms of funding terrorism?</p><p>GARAMENDI: Well, there are other sanctions that are still in place, additional sanctions may be necessary and they are always available to us going into the future. That's quite possible.</p><p>FREEMAN: Does that mean you're not supporting them now?</p><p>GARAMENDI: We need to work together with other countries. Right now, all of the focus is on the President threatening to dump the nuclear deal, which would set all of this thing back and not allow us to move forward on anything. So that's the first problem.</p><p>FREEMAN: I know but you just detailed all of their offenses in the region. Doesn't that justify bringing sanctions?</p><p>GARAMENDI: It could, and we need to be working with our allies on this issue. Some of those sanctions are a direct problem to our allies and that -- and to the United States.</p><p>For example, there's a major deal that has been cut, Iran wants to purchase dozens if not hundreds of new airliners. That's a big deal for the airbus and quite possibly for Boeing. And so as you look at those sanctions, you want to be careful to only use sanctions that are detrimental to Iran, not detrimental to the interest of the coalition partners.</p><p>So what I'm saying is that sanctions are there. They can be used. But just to go back and to put all of those back in place may create additional problems and not achieve the goal.</p><p>So look at this thing carefully. Use sanctions that are very targeted, that do put the appropriate pressure on Iran so that they will back away from many of the things.</p><p>But let me also put one more issue on the table and that is when the President said three weeks ago that we had completed the work on ISIS, he wanted to pull out the troops out of Syria, and that he wanted to leave Syria to others.</p><p>Well, it turns out that the others are Russia, Iran, Turkey, and the Gulf States. That creates an enormous vacuum of power that will be filled by Iran and that's not where we want to go. So you have to look at this thing in its total complexity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI: And if we do, I think we can make progress, keep the nuclear deal in place. It is working and it will work for many years into the future.</p><p>And secondly, make sure that we do apply the appropriate pressure. Keep in mind, Syria in this entire equation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen -- did you want to say something?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I just -- Congressman, you said look at the complete deal and all that's going on in its entirety. The problem that a lot of Americans have with that nuclear deal with Iran in the first place is we handed $1.7 billion in pallets of cash to Iran. Where is that money going as a state sponsor of terrorism?</p><p>It's going to fund terrorist attacks. It's going to fund Hezbollah. So you can't really separate those two. We gave them the money before there was any evidence that they were really pulling back on the nuclear program. We actually -- we flew it to Iran in the secret of night. And the only reason we even know about it is because of the reporting of the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>GARAMENDI: Well, that coffee has been spilled. That coffee's no longer in the cup. So what do we do going forward? The nuclear deal is in place and it is working. That's a good thing. That's a very, very important thing. Now, let's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You keep saying it's working -- Congressman.</p><p>GARAMENDI: It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But all of these things that are not working are so obvious. And then a moment ago you said we have to be careful because Iran's going to buy all these jets, possibly from Boeing and from others and we have to be careful about that.</p><p>What's our goal? Is our goal to stop the nuclear capability or get business for Boeing and the jet makers?</p><p>GARAMENDI: Well, you're quite correct, our goal was to stop the nuclear capability. And that is happening.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How is that happening if they're supporting Syria? They're supporting Hezbollah. They're threatening Israel. And they're using the $1.7 billion that we sent over there to do just that.</p><p>GARAMENDI: Calm down for a second and carefully take a listen to what you just said. The nuclear deal -- that was what we dealt with. The JCPOA was about Iran building a nuclear weapon and at that time --</p><p>HEGSETH: They're still building missiles -- Congressman. They're still testing and building missiles, delivery systems for nuclear capabilities.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GARAMENDI: Hang on a second. I want you to be very, very careful about what we're talking about here. Iran was on the cusp of actually building a nuclear weapon. They could have built one within one year, maybe less than one year. That's no longer the case. They do not now have the materials or the systems to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI: That's what the JCPOA was about. These other issues were not part of that deal. The important --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that was not smart. That was not smart.</p><p>GARAMENDI: -- the important -- excuse me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GARAMENDI: Well, maybe so. But I want you to understand Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. If they did have a nuclear weapon and all these other things were going on, where would we be?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's the bottom line. Congressman it's good to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>GARAMENDI: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks for (INAUDIBLE) it all out.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the news keeps getting worse for Deutsche Bank -- a stunning first quarter loss for the company.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on it and details right now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Oh man, Maria -- yes.</p><p>We're watching shares of Deutsche Bank this morning, very closely. Net income for the first quarter tumbled nearly 80 percent. That is leading the bank to cut jobs in the investment bank as well as Deutsche Bank saying that they're going to focus investment banking on serving core European clients.</p><p>They're going to reduce commitments to the U.S. and Asia. These results are Deutsche Bank's first since they ousted chief executive John Cryan back on April 8th.</p><p>So here we go. The stock is actually -- it's actually doing a little bit better than it was earlier, we should say. It's now down a little more than a half a percent. But again, some pressure on this stock today -- coming back a little bit.</p><p>All right. Subway is planning to close 500 stores in the U.S. this year. This is after the company announced a turnaround plan requiring franchise owners to invest more in operations and this is also on the back of Subway facing intense competition from rivals like McDonald's and Starbucks. Subway's U.S. sales dropped more than 4 percent last year. so another stock to watch today.</p><p>Well, the European space agency has released the largest map of our galaxy ever. And it contains more than a billion stars -- it's actually really cool. The 360-degree map was compiled by the Guya Project over the last few years. It displays a full quarter of our galaxy.</p><p>It took photos from opposite sides of our planet's orbit to pinpoint each star's exact locations. The public release of this new map expected to keep scientists and astronomers really busy studying stars for years to come. They're very excited about this.</p><p>And then there is this, a new study taking a look at cringe-worthy office phrases.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get out of here. I think I'm going to lose it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Even though it's Thursday, maybe we do. All right. Researchers say seven in ten Americans confess to saying such things as \"think outside the box\" or perhaps \"give 110 percent\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mentioned that earlier.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is no more than 100 percent. Just saying that -- I didn't even know that.</p><p>CASONE: No. There's more. \"Hammer it out\". Who likes that one, right? \"Run this up the flag pole\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: I hate that one.</p><p>CASONE: \"Throw them under the bus\". And this could be a \"win-win situation\". How many times have you heard that one -- Maria and Dagen?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: I've heard it a few times.</p><p>HEGSETH: I find this corporation specific stuff to be the worst. One is with a group that said we're not going to call them meetings anymore. We're going to call them \"knowledge shares\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: What?</p><p>HEGSETH: We're going to get together and do \"knowledge shares\".</p><p>MCDOWELL: \"Knowledge shares\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Knowledge shares\". That's hilarious.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Is that (INAUDIBLE) run by a thought leader?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And one more all men to avoid -- \"calm down\". When you tell a woman who is winning an argument with you to calm down -- generally stay away from that. We're going to hand you your business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, was I not calm?</p><p>HEGSETH: Of course, you were calm.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: I think he didn't like the content.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was calmly pushing back, saying no, I disagree, the Iran deal stinks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's called passion and accuracy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to take a break.</p><p>Speaking of Wall Street debuts, Sonos reportedly preparing an IPO -- could come as soon as June. We're going to check that out.</p><p>And then Alexa is now teaching etiquette. Amazon's smart assistant now made to encourage kids to say \"please\" and \"thank you\", next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The return of the trading desk -- according to the Wall Street journal U.S. banks are having their best year for trading revenue since the financial crisis because of the rise in volatility.</p><p>Joining us this morning Thomas H. Lee Partners co-president Scott Sperling. Scott -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SCOTT SPERLING, CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H. LEE PARTNERS: Thank you -- Maria. Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do you see the growth right now? Tell us about your investing and how you're allocating capital -- Scott.</p><p>SPERLING: Well, I think the areas that people have been looking at are ones where there's stronger secular growth trends and the entire health care sector is one where that continues to be an interesting opportunity, particularly in areas where you can help bend the cost curve, be able to provide high quality services with a more cost efficient delivery mechanism.</p><p>Another area is obviously the entire technology world offers significant subsectors of opportunity. The software area has been one that has been incredibly popular.</p><p>One of the things that we always have to do is measure the secular growth against the pricing it takes to buy those kinds of companies and I think having a reasonable amount of discipline in today's world will be rewarded long-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you seeing that both on the public side and on the private side? We started the conversation talking about the return of the trading desk because of an increase in volatility.</p><p>Do you see that -- those growth areas both on the public side as well as private side, which is what you're doing obviously, private investing?</p><p>SPERLING: Yes. I think these areas are ones that will account for a bigger and bigger percentage of the economic activity in the country, regardless of whether you're looking at companies that are still private or on the public side. So I think these are areas that will be interesting in both the public market as well as the private markets.</p><p>The ability of investors in today's public market to buy these companies at multiples that look something like 16 to 17 times, down from probably 19 to 20 times, could be reasonably attractive. The fundamentals that we see in the economy right now continue to be relatively strong.</p><p>I think it's not unreasonable to expect 3 percent GDP growth. I think when you combine that with the stimulus and some of that's coming from the stimulus of the tax cut, but combine it with the longer term impact of the stimulus with the tax cut, you can see this playing out for a longer duration than we ever would have thought when you look at the tenor of this recovery period.</p><p>FREEMAN: Question, James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\", question on interest rates.</p><p>SPERLING: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Some people get a little nervous when the yield on the 10-year treasury note hits 3 percent. As you know, we've had a lot of good years with that level -- good years for the economy, for the stock market. But I'm wondering what it means for you and your ability to do deals. Where do you get nervous in terms of that interest rate's going up or that number on the 10-year going up?</p><p>SPERLING: Sure. That is clearly part of the equation that we look at. We want to be in a world where the coverage ratios of our obligations is reasonably high. We never return to that '06 to '07 period when the coverage ratios had gotten well below 1.5x -- 1.5 times.</p><p>So as you look at the cost of debt, that comes into the calculation of what we're willing to pay for companies. Three percent as you point out is actually a relatively attractive rate when you look long-term at where those rates have been.</p><p>Oftentimes in our history it's been closer to 5 percent but certainly it's much higher than -- it's probably a hundred basis points higher than we have gotten used to over the last few years. So it has some impact on the value that will own the paper (ph) companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scott -- what's your take on technology here? I mean smart speaker maker Sonos is reportedly going public. The \"Journal\" first reporting that the IPO could value the company as high as $3 billion. Your thoughts on the IPO landscape and where you see technology opportunities today.</p><p>SPERLING: The markets will fall in and out of love obviously with any kind of company and certainly the technology sector has benefited when you look at the so-called FANG stocks and the impact that that has had in terms of the growth of the equity market values. It's been reasonably overwhelming.</p><p>So technology, because it does have significant secular growth in an economy where growth has been hard has been very popular. I think the applicability of technology to everything we do in our lives, so Sonos for example has certainly made it easier to have audio that has a diverse number of sources available to people in their homes. That kind of technology is one that will scale very well in the consumer market and people will pay for that.</p><p>Now, what you have to look at is what the nature of the competition will be over time. And while the overall market for that type of product, that functionality will continue to grow very strongly and everyone will evaluate the specific competitors within that to see what kind of share that they will have Sonos clearly has benefited from the one of the early drivers of this trend and this technology --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SPERLING: -- and you see that, I think in the expected value I think they want for the IPO.</p><p>FREEMAN: We're talking about the Wall Street trading desk doing so well and also about Deutsche Bank not doing well. You know, there are a lot of these big U.S. banks that keep complaining that if regulators here demand, they hold too much capital. It'll be a big disadvantage versus their overseas competitors and yet the U.S. banks seem to be crushing it versus their international competition.</p><p>SPERLING: Yes, they sure do. I think you have -- look, you have smart people across the industry, I can't comment on Deutsche Bank. The people we deal with are on the investment banking side and been very good. I can't comment more broadly on D.B. but the banks have adapted very well to the new rules that have dramatically reduced the leverage ratios at our commercial banking system.</p><p>So, whereas in zero six zero seven you were looking at 20 to 30 times leverage. You know, today you're really looking at 10 to 12 times leverage. So, the ROE, the return on their equity is not going to be as good as it was then but they've adapted very well to that. You see Goldman for example, Lloyd Blankfein has been out there talking about the consumer opportunity that Goldman has, and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SPERLING: -- markets has been a major effort for them to provide a set of services to the consumer market. So, they are looking at new areas of growth and at the same time, they continue to have very, very smart people who are very helpful to people like us, who are looking to them for financing and M&amp;A advice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting. Goldman's trying to get it -- is into the retail market. Blackstone Group into the retail market. Scott, good to see you sir.</p><p>SPERLING: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Scott Sperling. ( CO-PRESIDENT, THOMAS H. LEE PARTNERS )</p><p>SPERLING: You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us this morning.</p><p>SPERLING: Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to you. Coming up technology earnings blitz, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel all set to report results \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight. We're breaking down what to expect.</p><p>Then policing your kids, watching the web. Google now updating its YouTube Kids app, to improve parental controls. Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday April 26th. Your top stories right now 07:30 a.m. on the East Coast. It is the single busiest day for first quarter earnings today. General Motors and Southwest Airlines among the companies reporting this morning. G.M. beat expectations while Southwest was mixed. There's a look at the stocks both under pressure today. G.M. down 2-1/2 percent, Southwest down 3-1/2 percent.</p><p>Investors are also waiting on big tech. AmazonIntel and Microsoft all reporting their quarter after the close tonight. Checking the broader markets this morning while we see those stocks trading up and the broader market up as well. The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday and the momentum continues this morning up 40 points on the Dow right now.</p><p>Boeing was a big earnings beat yesterday. That stock was strong and that lifted the Dow. Up about 60 points at the close yesterday. The S&amp;P was up about five, but the Nasdaq was under selling crasher finishing lower by 3- 1/2.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are trading up. FT-100 CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are higher. CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, the others are fractionally moving, but in the plus column.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the ECB decision, the European Central Bank news is going to be out in about 15 minutes. No change in rate expected. But we are watching the ECB President Mario Draghi during his news conference and what he says about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed. China was the weak spot. The Shanghai Composite down one and a third percent.</p><p>Big technology is now targeting kids. Amazon and YouTube making changes so that parents can breathe a sigh of relief, will tell you about it. And then it's NFL draft day. We're taking a look at the technology that's helping prevent player injuries. All that coming up.</p><p>But first this, technology earnings Blitz. Tech giants Amazon, Microsoft and Intel all do out \"AFTER THE BELL\" tonight.</p><p>Meanwhile Facebook and Alphabet both beating expectations this week. The two technology darlings posted a spike in digital ad dollars accounting for 91 percent of Facebook's revenue and 97 percent of Google parent company revenue. That could give us some information about Amazon, because Amazon will also report ad revenue with its prime business tonight. Joining us right now is AppNexus CEO, Brian O'Kelley. Brian, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRIAN O'KELLEY, CEO, APPNEXUS: Thanks for having me</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you have a great read on advertising revenue. Explain AppNexus and tell us what you're seeing in ad revenue right now.</p><p>O'KELLEY: All right. So, AppNexus is the technology that helps companies who aren't Facebook get as much money for their content as possible. So, if you -- if you're watching FOX Business right now, you're seeing ads. Who decides what ads you see? Well, for many of the companies who aren't Facebook, that's app Nexus. We're trying to use machine learning and non- personal information to figure out which ads are the most effective to serve to all the consumers watching T.V. or reading articles on the web. So, that's what we do.</p><p>Now the big challenge in advertising right now, is that if your Facebook or Google you have an immense amount of data about consumers that they've -- in many cases freely given, and you can use that to micro-target ads. But of course, that also means that the consumer is the product. You're effectively selling the consumer their own data and monetizing that as you see in these earnings incredibly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly and that's what kept them in trouble.</p><p>O'KELLEY: Indeed.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Do you -- and you can avoid that because you're not holding anyone's personal data. You don't have the Facebook problem of how do I protect your privacy. Is that right?</p><p>O'KELLEY: That's correct. Of course, we have the opposite problem which is that we don't know who you are. And so, we have to use these macro techniques to figure out what ads you'll probably like if you're watching this show or if you're reading that article. But we don't know who you are.</p><p>FREEMAN: So, like we've seen in some recent years, Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent capturing almost all the growth or all the growth in online advertising. I believe in mobile advertising. Is that trend changing?</p><p>O'KELLEY: Well, I think this last quarter we saw that decline a little bit. So, Google's share went down a little. So, we're starting to see that change. I think the biggest challenge is that if consumers continue to want to go to Facebook or see videos on YouTube that's where the advertisers are going to go. So, the challenge is if you're any other media company or content producer, how do you get the consumers to spend less time on Facebook or spend less time on YouTube?</p><p>HEGSETH: So, I mean that was part of the criticism of Facebook is there a monopoly effectively in a particular space. Do you anticipate competitors then? Would that would create that opportunity for other advertisers?</p><p>O'KELLEY: I'd love to see competitors. When you have a consumer backlash against Facebook, people were very upset with Facebook and yet where do you go? You know?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>O'KELLEY: Tweet?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That goes -- that goes to what Sheryl Sandberg said on the call yesterday that they haven't had seen a meaningful trend of advertisers fleeing the platform. It was a little strange because there was so much advertiser outrage at YouTube when they found -- the advertisers found out that their commercials were appearing and videos of questionable, if not repugnant content. But this, it's like, as long as the advertisers attitude seems to be, as long as this benefits us we don't really care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, and as a P.R. move they have this latest apology, a promising to keep data safe. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But then something happened we had to deal with spam, clickbait, fake news and data misuse. That's going to change.</p><p>From now on, Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your privacy. So we can all get back to what made Facebook good in the first place, friends.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that enough? I mean the stock is up today after the strong quarterly results because people are saying well maybe this didn't matter to investors and advertisers.</p><p>O'KELLEY: I think it matters a ton. I mean, when I talk to the largest advertisers in the world they say consistently, I want an alternative to YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? OK.</p><p>O'KELLEY: I don't want to spend my money there but that's where people were spending all their time. So, I think the biggest challenge is really that, you can delete Facebook. And I wish you would because (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know if you can delete it. We were hearing that people try to delete the app and they couldn't.</p><p>O'KELLEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's like impossible to get rid of Facebook</p><p>O'KELLEY: That's a monopoly. So, what are we going to do?</p><p>FREEMAN: It's this is obviously a product that a lot of consumers have freely chosen to this point. But this is interesting that you're hearing from advertisers that they would like new options. Because you look at these earnings reports 50 percent growth in the ad revenue at Facebook. They're still writing and increasingly writing checks even if they seem to want more options.</p><p>O'KELLEY: Yes, well one thing to think about is that as television becomes more and more digital so, people cut the cord and we can actually do more intelligent ad insertion into T.V. Broadcast we show everyone the same ad. But increasingly we can choose different ads for different people. And that means we can get much better results for television advertising. And I think that gives people a real alternative, where on digital advertising right now YouTube has a huge monopoly of digital. But don't forget that's a small subset of all of the advertising that these big marketers are spending. So, it looks like a lot of digital but as we see T.V. come towards this, we're going to see a very, very different landscape.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you need to figure out a better way to connect the viewer and the customer with the actual buying opportunity which is what Instagram which is owned by Facebook does so brilliantly. It's like they show you something and it's like click on this to click on this ad and you can purchase it immediately literally with your finger, and your thumb print on your iPhone. So, again that that's the challenge for traditional advertising. Even if the video is delivered on this device.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then they can measure all of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They measure it all and then that's what the advertisers want.</p><p>O'KELLEY: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really, really important conversation. Brian, thank you. Thank you so much.</p><p>O'KELLEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Brian O'Kelly, joining us there, AppNexus.</p><p>Coming up, Alexa for kids. The new way Amazon is helping to teach your children manners. Then keeping kids safe on the web YouTube rules out improved parental controls as well. Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news, the European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged as expected. We're waiting on Mario Draghi and his press conference within the next hour to see if he has -- will reveal anything else about stimulus. No change in market action. This in fact was expected.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this, Amazon is releasing a kid-friendly Echo Dot with parental controls. Alexa may already be listening in. Gerri Willis, with the details now, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, she is listening in. And don't forget that. But I'm a big fan. And if you're worried about Alexa's smart voice assistance eavesdropping on your conversations, well you probably should be concerned and here's why. By exploiting a coding error in Alexa's skills, the researchers found a way to get the device to continue listening even long after the software was activated.</p><p>Amazon said it's fixed this problem. But I have to tell you, she's listening in on what you're saying. And now Alexa may help you raise your kids. You're seeing the products right here. It's the new Echo Dot for kids. They encase it in rubber basically and they put special content on it just for kids. Now, $79.99 is the original price for this.</p><p>But if you want to buy the souped up version of this over time, you can get access to audio books, radio stations, just for kids, Disney content, Nickelodeon and National Geographic content, that will cost you extra after the first year, $2.99 a month per kid and of course we've seen Google, YouTube struggle with this very issue. They have an app for kids that hasn't worked very well and they're trying to make improvements to that. But the kids Amazon feature is so interesting because they're trying to get people to talk nice to Alexa. So, if children say please, then they get rewarded for it. They're told (INAUDIBLE) thank you very much for that, for speaking nicely to me. And I hear that the real concern about this isn't are you being nice to Alexa. The real concern was Alexa is always a woman's voice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: So, they didn't want people -- kids learning to be nasty to women.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think -- I can't believe this, that they're listening even when you don't know that they're listening. This is an incredibly story Gerri, really. Thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We want to leave it there. Because we have breaking news. We want to talk to you about this. Dr. Ronny Jackson is pulling out of the race for the V.A. Secretary. Pete Hegseth, we are just getting this news. Dagen, you saw it crossing. Anything else?</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is the reporting --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ronny Jackson.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is reporting from John Roberts, the Chief White House Correspondent at the FOX News Channel. But I think that this was expected, was it not?</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, I mean, as of last night it looked like it was likely, too much stuff had come out. And people didn't know if it was verified or not. He was denying most of it. It was a quick pick from this president as well from a guy he truly respected with a -- with a proven record in the military and as a doctor in the White House through to multiple administrations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: I mean, he got a lot of praise from the Obama folks as well. Too much, too fast.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was these revelation that were put out, and quite frankly when I put on Twitter, you know, it's an insult to snakes to call Washington, D.C. A snake pit, that all of this information started coming out in the press about allegations of drinking on the job, of pill prescribing, questionable practices prescribing medication to people within the White House. I just thought it was deeply unfortunate. And I don't know why anybody --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's deeply unfortunate. But apparently, there was a trip that only a small cabal of people in the Obama administration was on and now we understand that this is getting out. I mean, it's really unfortunate what the previous administration is doing to this current administration in terms of leaks, in terms of trying hard to put all these barriers up in place. I actually think it's disgusting. I mean it's a -- but it feels like that's the only way this information could have gotten out. That's why I bring this up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, it does show what a nasty town Washington can be. And also, the oddity of this story is this is not a nominee who came from somewhere else and these reports come out. This is someone that is -- the president has been working with closely, that the previous president worked with closely. You had a lot of people on the record from both parties saying this is a solid citizen, a great colleague, and so to now have off the record --</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- allegations. Contrary to what the president and his predecessor have said they witnessed, I find it just beyond bizarre that this is what takes down a nominee. But that's the culture we live in now.</p><p>HEGSETH: No, go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, there and -- you can speak to this. There are great entrenched interests.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In the way that the veterans administration operates, in terms of the way that money is doled out. So, if they think, these interests think that somebody's going to come in and change the status quo in terms of who gets the money and how much then --</p><p>HEGSETH: The veterans industrial complex is powerful. This guy was -- this president wants to shake it up. He would have as well. He never got his encore. He never got his confirmation hearing, said it was rumor and innuendo which is incredibly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't that right.</p><p>FREEMAN: It's so awful. Why didn't Obama fire him? And why has President Trump had such a good working experience with him?</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's a cabal that wants to destroy Donald Trump.</p><p>HEGSETH: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they want chaos around him. Your name has been floated out there.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, it has.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you want the job?</p><p>HEGSETH: If the president asked me to serve, great. But he hasn't at this point. So, we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The NFL draft kicks off tonight on FOX as new technology is helping players put their best foot forward. Cheryl Casone with all the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: About the foot Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: There you go. NFL draft day is here, and as young athletes are preparing to enter the league, the NFL is looking at new ways to protect them. So, I went down to the New York Giants training facility to find out how a partnership with H.P. is helping them stay one step ahead of injury.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CASONE: It's one of the biggest risks of playing in the NFL, injury. But it's not just concussions that take players out of the game. With nearly two-thirds of football injuries occurring in the lower limbs, the shoes athletes wear can determine a team's fate.</p><p>LEIGH WEISS, DIRECTOR OF REHABILITATION, NEW YORK GIANTS: Shoes are no longer seen as a piece of apparel. You know, they're a piece of protective equipment.</p><p>CASONE: Here at the New York Giants training facility, they are using this. Technology from H.P. with 3D scanning that creates digital profiles of players' feet.</p><p>JOE SKIBA, EQUIPMENT DIRECTOR, NEW YORK GIANTS: It's taking your foot, it's taking your length, it's taking your width.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>SKIBA: So, one of the most important things in today's game is players safety.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SKIBA: So, the first thing we want to do is we want to take a scan and make sure he's actually wearing the exact footwear he should be wearing to perform on the field.</p><p>CASONE: Quarterback Davis Webb showed me how it all works.</p><p>DAVIS WEBB, QUARTERBACK, NEW YORK GIANTS: Your right foot is a -- is a little bigger.</p><p>CASONE: OK, your right arch is bigger than your left. So, you do need custom shoes?</p><p>Turned out, he needed the equipment more than he thought.</p><p>SKIBA: So, we're going to put the recommendation right here.</p><p>WEBB: That's what I wear.</p><p>CASONE: Is this right?</p><p>SKIBA: Actually, this is not -- this is actually not a set-up. This is actually the cleat that Davis actually wears.</p><p>CASONE: H.P. technology puts million-dollar players together with high end shoes from Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, boosting performance and health.</p><p>RON COUGHLIN, PRESIDENT, H.P. PERSONAL SYSTEMS: There's probably no shoe that has more pressure than a 300-pound linemen on a cleat. And so, having the best fit for them and the support, they probably have the highest need in the world. So, it was a great place for us to test our technology.</p><p>CASONE: Every player from all 32 NFL teams are being scanned for this season.</p><p>JENNIFER LANGTON, VICE PRESIDENT, NFL HEALTH AND SAFETY: We can help bring innovation to the space, i.e. You know, the H.P. fit scanner, so they are in the best cleat available for themselves.</p><p>CASONE: And the Giants are hoping their partnership with H.P. will give them a shoe-in to the Super Bowl.</p><p>WEISS: So, at the end of the day, you know, the healthy football teams are usually more successful football teams and that's -- and that's what we started for.</p><p>CASONE: So, a healthy team is a winning team?</p><p>WEISS: Yes, that's what keeps me up at night.</p><p>CASONE: And since I'm a runner, I had to try it.</p><p>COUGHLIN: Wow, you have a big width difference. Do you know that?</p><p>CASONE: No.</p><p>COUGHLIN: Really?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, look at that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: But you did come up with two cleats.</p><p>COUGHLIN: In case, you are going to go out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CASONE: All right, so yes, I learned a few things about my own feet as well, Maria, when I went out and shot the story. But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you need custom made shoes?</p><p>CASONE: I need custom-made shoes. I have a low arch on my left and a right -- a high arch on my right. I had no clue. I have whacky feet. But so are they. So, I feel better about it. Anyway, the draft is tonight, we're really excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Don't forget to catch the live coverage of the NFL draft tonight, 8:00 p.m. Eastern time. Showtime. Cheryl, thank you. Still ahead, Kanye West causes a stir again after the rapper tweets his praise of president Trump and has a new not so kind words of former president Obama, next hour, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it its Thursday, April 26th.

Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Thursday, July 27th.  Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  There's an earnings blitz happening on Wall Street,  Twitter shares are following down seven percent this morning after  reporting a second quarter earnings.  The company reported it had 328  million monthly active users but that showed no growth from the previous  quarter, ad revenue was also down 14 percent even though it was better than  expected.  The stock, selling off down at lows right now, down better than  nine percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a packed earnings week this week and it's the markets to all-time  highs.  The Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&amp;P 500 all close in record territory  yesterday.  All-time highs for the Dow and the momentum continues this  morning.  We're expecting gains at the opening of trading.  In Europe this  morning, stocks are mixed, take a look at the indices in the Eurozone with  the major averages turning negative a few minutes ago.  The FT 100, the CAC  quarante and the DAX Index all in a negative territory.  Down two-thirds of  a percent on DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board, the major averages all closed  strongly overnight.  The health care debate is raging on Capitol Hill this  morning once again.  Lawmakers rejected a proposal of a clean repeal of  Obamacare last night.  Vice President Mike Pence weighed in on the  importance of doing a deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The very essence of  living in a free society is people get to make their own decisions, but the  president and I truly believe that if you lower the cost of health  insurance, if you give Americans more choices in health insurance, that  more Americans will choose more employers will choose to have and offer  health insurance to their own employees and have health insurance for their  families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump tweeting on matter this morning, here is what  the president said a few minutes ago, come on republican senators, you can  do it on health care after seven years this is your chance to shine.  Don't  let the American people down, says the president, tragedy in Ohio to  report, one person was killed and several others injured after an  attraction at the stage fair malfunctioned.  Governor John Kasich ordered  all rides shut down following the incident.  The very latest as three  people remain in critical condition this morning.  </p><p>AstraZeneca, the stock to watch this morning.  Shares of the pharmaceutical  company are down in the premarket, the stock - we're looking at Amazon  right now, but the stock suffered a setback in the trials of its highly  anticipated lung cancer drug.  As a result, the stock is falling down at a  bad down 15 percent AstraZeneca.  Right now we will break down the report  on that lung cancer drug.  Plus, we've got 99 problems but it takes not one  of them, why Jay-Z is in cassette state of mind for his latest project.   And Sean Spicer next job already lined up?  Why the former White House  press secretary may dance his way from podium to the ballroom, yes Dancing  with the Stars calling on Sean Spicer.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining us to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist, Michael Block, and Maverick Pac National Co-Chair, treasury  attache to Saudi Arabia, Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May his feet work better than his mouth.  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL:  I think that would be  great and I think that the president would like it because he likes reality  television.  I think he would be proud of Sean (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless he embarrassed him, like maybe he has no rhythm, you  never know.  I mean, the --</p><p>ORTAGUS:  But then SNL can keep going because (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The current Energy Secretary Rick Perry was on there.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's a good point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that was not a winning performance.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dancing with the Stars, Sean Spicer.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  I'm  uncharacteristically speechless.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I see it.  OK.  Our top story right now this hour, senate  republicans are turning their focus to pass a slimmed down with a calling  skinny repeal of Obamacare, this after failing to secure a simple majority  of 51 votes needed to pass a clean repeal.  Seven republicans voted down  the measure yesterday even though six of them voted for repealing Obamacare  back in 2015.  So what changed now they don't want to vote for it.   Republicans expressing mixed views on the process.  Watch this.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  It's a good news that more republicans  actually supported clean repeal, it is disappointing though that many  republicans who promised to vote for a repeal already had voted for this  repeal, chose this time not to vote for it.</p><p>SEN. THOM TILLIS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  We have a chance of getting a bill  out, whether or not it's the scope that some of us would prefer is what  we're looking at but I think anything that keeps the process moving gets us  to conference and potentially come up with the consensus is something I  fully support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, it's just hours left the debate, the senate skinny repeal  would eliminate some of the most unpopular parts of Obamacare, including  the individual mandate and a tax on medical devices.  The president tweeted  this earlier, come on republican senators, you can do it on health care  after search on years this is your chance to shine.  Don't let American  people down.  Joining us right now, Wisconsin congressman, Sean Duffy.   Congressman, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  Hey, good to see you too, Maria.  Thanks  for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You reaction to what happened in the senate, where are we in  this process?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  What I'm little disappointed the senate couldn't get their  hands around a repeal, this is a repeal of Obamacare.  When Obama was in  office, there were just doing training runs of a repeal of Obamacare and  that was fine they could vote for that but now that this is the live action  where the votes actually (INAUDIBLE) repeal it, they won't able to do it.   That's frustrating.  But my position, Maria, is if we can get the skinny  repeal that you just mentioned, at least we get to go to conference with  the house.</p><p>And we can -- we can beef this thing up and actually get a repeal and  replace bill that will work in the house and it's going to give senators  more time to get their hands around.  What we should actually do with  health care -- and what I mean by that too is that their constituents are  going to start to put pressure on them.  Light up their switchboards, come  to town halls, go to their (INAUDIBLE) over August and say this inaction on  health care is not acceptable, your promises have to be kept, you have to  get a backbone and you're going to have to move with the house and get a  real health care repeal and replace done.  That's the only way this is  going to work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, if that happens, when does it go to conference then, after  August?  </p><p>DUFFY:   I got to tell you what, it's like reading tea leaves here.  It's -  it depends how quickly they move on the skinny repeal, we can still do it  in August. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DUFFY:  Timelines are tough, but it's still possible.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Hey, Congressman.  Mike Block here.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Hi, Mike.  </p><p>BLOCK:  So, let's assume that, you know, that the senate can get the repeal  done and go back in the conference with the house.  How closely could a  final bill look like the current -- the bill that was passed by the house?   You know, what needs to come out of that, what needs to go back in, what  are key points here?  </p><p>DUFFY:  Well, I think that's a good - that's a good point.  And it's going  to have to look pretty close to the house bill.  I mean, if the senate does  a skinny repeal and all we have is a bill that gets rid of individual and  the employer mandates and medical device tax, what the hell is that?   That's a little too skinny for us.  We're going to have to beef this bill  up and actually get a repeal and replace, we want to drive the private  market, back into health care and remove the government and so again, it is  going to be a little dance at the two of us do but it has to be much  stronger than probable what they'll pass much more like the house bill.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  Let me ask you about the president's announcing the  Foxconn story, this is a big deal for Wisconsin, right?  Their president  announced that electronics giant Foxconn would build 10-billion-dollar  factory in Wisconsin.  It will be the largest development project in the  state creating 3,000 jobs.  What do you think this factory billed means for  Wisconsin economy and do you expect this to actually take place we know  what happened in Pennsylvania.  </p><p>DUFFY:  So, I was at the White House yesterday, I don't know if people  covered Governor Walker's comments live but he called it the West Conn  Valley where Foxconn was going to invest.  Yes.  It's going to be $10  billion of investment.  It's going to be 3,000 to 13,000 new jobs in  Wisconsin.  This is a big deal for state, not just Foxconn but then all the  supporting industries and businesses that rise up around it.  This is going  to be great for our state.  And I think it's unique that you have a  governor and a president that are coming together to make a sales pitch to  companies around the world that Wisconsin and America are great place to  invest.</p><p>We're going to get - we're going to get our tax code right.  It's painful  but we have great - we have great employees that are smart to innovative,  the high-skilled and this pitch work, Foxconn coming to America.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -</p><p>DUFFY:  That same pitch works, Dagen.  One second.  The same pitch works to  the American companies who were thinking about leaving that they should  actually stay, so it's working. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm glad that you knew it was me who's to interrupt you. </p><p>DUFFY:  I know, Dagen.  I can't wait for your question.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman though, why should have any American have hoped that  you, all lawmakers in Washington will be able to do something serious and  beneficial on tax reform?  And overhauling the tax code because watching  the senate try and overhaul the health care system has been a disaster of  individuals just looking out for themselves and not even their  constituents.  </p><p>DUFFY:  So, Dagan, it's not that I have hope in the senate.  I have hope in  the American people, that they are going to hold the senate to account.   And if you're a republican senator who is getting lit up by your democrats  who have never voted for you or you're (INAUDIBLE) and you come home and  you also have your republicans and conservatives who did vote for you, who  might have wrote you a $50 check for your campaign and they're mad at you?</p><p>You realize that you are in a really bad place.  And that's why I think the  American people are going to say, this is unacceptable that the senate not  move and that's why I think -- in the end going to get it done.  So, I have  hope not in senate but in the American people and the pressure they'll put  on the congress, and when the American people put pressure the congress  responds. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- I mean, so you do expect then you'll get health care and  taxes done still this year or does this bleed into '18?  </p><p>DUFFY:  I do, but listen, if the only - if the only repeal of taxes in  Obamacare is the medical device tax, that doesn't leave us a lot of room  for tax reform because as I told you on your show before, we're taking the  Obamacare taxes to the tune of a trillion dollars and use that for tax  reform in budget reconciliation, tax reform has to be revenue neutral, this  all gets pretty complicated quickly but we need big taxes Obamacare to  actually do tax reform in the house, so again, the tax part the Obamacare  conversation is incredibly important for the next phase which is simply tax  reform unless, Dagen, we can get rid of the filibuster rule in the senate  which means, we could then have wholesale health care reform and wholesale  tax reform without these ridiculous rules but the senate doesn't want to do  that either.   That's why I'm a house guy.  I'm staying - I'm here --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Republicans can't even get a -- to 51 votes on just a repeal or  even repeal and replacement.  They had to fly John McCain in to even move  doggone thing to a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And he has brain cancer. </p><p>DUFFY:  Listen, this is - I mean, if you're American watching this, just  like - just like you on the show, you're disappointed, you're like, what  the hell is going on in the congress if they can't act?  I totally agree  with that.  We had our problems as you saw in the house, it was painful for  us to get a health care repeal and replace done but we actually came  together as a conference and worked through our differences and it took us  longer than we would have liked but we made that happen for the American  people.</p><p>The U.S. senate has to do that same kind of thing they have to sit in a  room and figure out the nuances of health care and we can't as a - as a  country forget what democrats did here.  Your democrats on sidelines,  throwing bombs at republicans but they gave us the failed Obamacare.  This  law is imploding and they're doing nothing to help us fix it.  But now what  they say is, all we want is we want a single payer health care system.   That's the only way we'll help.  It's if we drove the health care car into  the ditch but now we want to drive the government in complete control of  your health care which is absolutely unacceptable for us.</p><p>It would it be refreshing if democrats would go, hey, here is how we could  actually move health care forward where we could help people who are poor,  we can help people with pre-existing conditions but we can help stand up a  private market so families, individuals have a choice of products that meet  the risks that they in their life and a price that they can actually  afford.  With deductibles that aren't so high that they would never be able  to use their plans.  This would make sense but the democrats are no part of  this conversation which I think is sad. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They don't want agenda executed.  Look, that's very  clear.  But what are you going to do about it?  OK.  So that's not  changing, that's been the situation, the democrats are not going to  participate in governing.  I have skepticism that they're even going to  participate in a tax reform package.  So what are you going to do?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, again, we have the options with some of the senate rules like  budget reconciliation to act on our own.  If the senate republicans can act  and that's why we're here together, standing frustrated that we're unable  to do it.  But to your point, Maria, I think it's interesting, that the  senate democrats are making republicans go through budget reconciliation.   You would think that senate democrats would say, let's sit down together  and figure out where we go as a country to make America competitive again,  not just on our individual rates but on our corporate rates.  They're  absolutely refusing to do that.  I mean, Steve Mnuchin is going to be  before our house financial services committee today, I've heard on your  show, you're talking about yesterday, do -- are we going to have a 40  percent top rate, are we going to increase taxes, is that what the  administration is going to talk about?  I think today in the house  financial services, those are questions that the secretary is going to get.   What's your vision of where we go with tax reform?  Are we talking about  (INAUDIBLE) oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not going over well.  Hey, Congressman, we are happy to  hear that your colleague in the majority whip Steve Scalise is out of the  hospital.  That's terrific news.  I hope you'll send him our best.  Sean  Duffy, good to see you, sir.</p><p>DUFFY:  You too, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Stay tuned tomorrow.  House Speaker Paul Ryan will  be with us exclusive.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big day for technology.  Well, Twitter is selling off but  Facebook we're watching because it's reporting earnings that beat  expectations last night.  The company also posted its 71 percent rise in  profits for second-quarter.  There are the numbers with revenue above 9  billion.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney.   Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I'm shaking my head, Maria,  because I can't wrap my arms around the wealth creation involved with these  five big technology companies.  I've just done a back of the envelope  calculations here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's 3 trillion.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it's 3.1 trillion, and that's according to yesterday's  closings levels.  You chuck in an $11-gain for Facebook, and another gain  for Amazon, as of this morning, and you're probably looking at $3.2  trillion.  Frankly, Maria, I've never, ever seen anything like this before,  ever.  I've been doing this 40 years, a lot longer than you have, Maria.   That's a fact. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  Yes, you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  I point that out to our viewers, please.  I've never seen anything  like this.  I mean, I can't -- I can't quite come to terms with what we're  seeing, and I don't think that this is getting the kind of exposure, the  media coverage that it really deserves.  I'm not sort of saying, oh,  Russia, Russia, Russia is not important.  I'm not saying that health care  reform is not important, or tax breaks.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm not  saying that the swamp is not important.  I am saying that this is more  important. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is astonishing wealth creation, technological leadership by  American corporations and it's not over.  Facebook is going to go up $11 a  share in about, what, 30 odd minutes.  That's extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We had -- we had Ann Winblad on -- we're going to have her on  this weekend for \"WALL STREET WEEK\".  And one thing she said to me was  these five companies with $3 trillion in value, they're going to spend $60  billion on R&amp;D and acquisitions in terms of buying into small start-ups.   That's more than the federal government spent on R&amp;D in 2015 which is when  the last time that they measured it.  It is extraordinary, but the truth  is, Stuart, what I like about it is it's not the 90s, it's not like we are,  you know, buying these stocks because of clicks to the Web site.  It's not  like these valuation has gone all the way here, because there aren't  earnings.  There are real earnings and there are real businesses today,  different than the 90s.</p><p>VARNEY:  I remember -- I remember watching you, Maria, report on the dot- com thing of the 1990s.  I remember Qualcomm, it went up $200 one morning.   I remember that.  This is -- I remember you saying it.  I mean,  squillionaire.  Is that what you're calling it?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's funny.</p><p>VARNEY:  But now, this is completely different.  They have real money,  they've got real growth, they've got real profits, and they have  extraordinary power.  This is not the dot-com days.  It's very different,  very new.  As I said, I can't wrap my arms around it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  Yes, which is why a lot of people think it continues  incredibly.  That's what Ann Winblad says.  She's got a lot of comments on  this, this weekend.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.  I know you've  got a lot more on it at the top of the hour.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m.  So join Stuart in the next 10  minutes.  </p><p>First, though, under the hood and in the garage.  We're taking you live to  the new luxury options to lure sports car enthusiasts to the racetrack.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sports car enthusiasts are not just buying faster vehicles,  they're building luxury garages as well.  Jeff Flock is in Illinois this  morning with a look at this growing trend.  Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Oh, just out on the track,  Maria.  And I tell you, you know, these days, people buy these fast cars.   I'm in a Camaro right now.  We've got our friends at G.M. and Ford.  I've  loaned us a couple of cars for this.  And, you know, where do you run these  cars when if you run them at top speed, you're obviously breaking the law?   Well, here is where you come.  This is the Autobahn Country Club outside  Chicago.  I don't know if you can see me.  Hey, hey, we're having some fun  out here.  These are -- and I got with me, Mark Basso, this was his  brainchild.  Mark, what were you thinking?  You built an entire track where  you come out and you run your car, and you also build what they call Garage  Mahals, what the heck?</p><p>MARK BASSO, PRESIDENT, AUTOBAHN COUNTRY CLUB:  Thanks (INAUDIBLE) this is - - Autobahn is basically a place where car enthusiasts can enjoy their cars  the way they were meant to be driven.</p><p>FLOCK:  Got you.</p><p>BASSO:  A 350-acre facility.</p><p>FLOCK:  350 acres, Maria.  And it's like a golf club where the course is  actually the race course.  And these places -- we've got some pictures of  Bobby (INAUDIBLE) Garage Mahal.  But I tell you, he's a big star, a former  Indy Car driver and winner, but anybody can come out here and have one,  right?</p><p>BASSO:  Yes.  It's designed to enjoy your car the way they're meant to be  driven.  So, it's a 3-1/2 mile road course, one of the largest in the U.S.</p><p>FLOCK:  And Mark, this was the first one, by the way, and now there are a  lot of these that are popping up around the country that people want to  have a fast car they want to be able to actually run it.  I'm amazed by  numbers and what these look like.  They cost millions.</p><p>BASSO:  Yes, it's amazing.  Basically, they have a (INAUDIBLE) and they can  put up the Garage Mahal of their dreams.  And these things range from 4,000  to 12,000 square feet.</p><p>FLOCK:  Wow.  OK.</p><p>BASSO:  Beautiful (INAUDIBLE) that overlook the track, parking spaces.</p><p>FLOCK:  Beautiful.  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  We're out of time and I'm  almost out of track here, whoa!  OK.  Mark says why did I agree to ride  with this guy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:   Wow.</p><p>FLOCK:  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, you got the best gig.</p><p>BASSO:  This is part of the track I've never seen before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Flock.</p><p>FLOCK:  I tried.  Let's see if I survive it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the best, Jeff Flock.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts right now, Morgan Ortagus.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  So the Congress passed a veto-proof bill on Russian sanctions,  which includes sanctions on other countries as well.  But Anthony  Scaramucci indicated this morning that potentially the President may veto  it to get a tougher deal.  I would watch that.  It's veto-proof, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael?</p><p>BLOCK:  One more risk factor for the market we haven't talked about is the  Fed.  Yesterday, they got a little more aggressive on how they're going to  unwind the balance sheet, and we need to watch out for that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Happy birthday, mama.  To a generous, courageous, strong,  amazing woman.  I'm lucky to be your daughter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, happy birthday, Mama McDowell!  Have a great -- McDowell,  have a great day.  That will do for us.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" right now --  Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  And happy birthday from me as well.  All right, Maria, thank you  very much, indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yey!  Sure.  We've got the whole place here.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is going to be a very big day for your money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Thursday morning,  welcome back.  Thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is  Thursday, July 27th.  Your top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the East  Coast.

RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  You know I pledged to the voters to repeal  Obamacare I think it's a disaster but the bill doesn't repeal it, it keeps  about half of the Obamacare taxes, it keeps most of the Obamacare  regulations, it keeps most of the Obamacare subsidies and creates a giant  new insurance bailout super fund of about $200 billion, this isn't repeal  by any means shape or form. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on the battle to repeal and replace Obamacare coming up.   Janet Yellen faces questions about her future, the Fed chair spoke about  the possibility of another term while speaking before Congress yesterday.   She also said that the fed will continue to raise interest rates, she's  going to be speaking today investors are eyeing her testimony, before the  Senate Banking Committee today, we will see if she makes as much news this  morning.

And Alexa find me a  house the details as Amazon possible venture into the real estate market  hits home for companies like Zillow the stock trade again yesterday.  Plus,  you know all his name.</p><p>But will we soon be calling him Senator, the details behind Kid Rock's  possible plans to run for public office.  We've got it; first to our top  story this half hour Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen heads to Capitol  Hill for second day of hearings today this time testifying in front of the  Senate Banking Committee yesterday the fed chair addressed state of the  economy and her intention to raise interest rates before the House  Financial Services Committee meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  The economy will continue to  expand to the moderate pace over the next couple of years, with the job  market strengthening somewhat further and inflation rising to two percent,  this judgment reflects our view that monetary policy remains commentated  the committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will  warrant gradual increases in the Federal funds rate overtime to achieve and  maintain maximum employment and stable prices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of inflation we just got the producer price index it  was up 1/10 of a percent or perhaps lack of.  Joining us right now Grant  Interest Rate Observer founder James Grant in the studio, Jim it's great to  see you. </p><p>JAMES GRANT, FOUNDER, GRANT INTEREST RATE OBSERVER:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GRANT:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Janet Yellen yesterday?</p><p>GRANT:  Well, I think that she's never going to get into trouble saying  things as bland as things she said, but you know one ought to stop and ask  why is some of her statements for example she says inflation is worrying  because it's too low why do we need two percent inflation we never know why  we need it we are told we do need it.  This country enjoyed or I guess as  we would say today suffered five consecutive years of inflation of less  than two percent from1960 -- 1955 the earth turned America, prospered and  now we are in a position to the fed feels it has to generate the credit  that will levitate prices on average two percent.  The consequences of that  attempt to raise up prices on main street has -- still over in Wall Street,  we have a wonderful bull market that is financed to greet degree and it  seems to me by exertions of the Federal reserve and would be very hard to  stop exerting because the world would become accustomed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you agree with her assessment that the economy is moving,  growing enough to warrant higher interest rates?</p><p>GRANT:  Well I think the world expects the central banks to try to do  something normalize rates, what Janet Yellen never fails to do these days  is to is to add that if there is the a stubble, or a misstep the fed will  do everything it can to reinstitute the policies that it seeks to escape  from.  So we have a -- an abnormal balance sheet of Federal reserve we have  a fed today owns 18 percent of the country's first mortgages and owns 24  percent of all government securities in hands of public immense $41 and a  half trillion edifice of a balance sheet.  And the fed wants out of it, but  you know the old Wall Street joke is I'm going to sell to whom?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GRANT:  Right, so that is the question before House, another question for  the House is the fed seeks to raise the Federal funds rate its target  interest rate it seeks to raise this, at a time when Janet Yellen herself  says that the economy could be weaker than she expects or it could be  stronger than she expects, any case the rate of growth in every day  dollars, what we call nominal GDP is very weak historical standards auto  sales are weakening. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tax receipts. </p><p>GRANT:  I mean you never know I mean Janet Yellen is quite right to be  humble about the future insofar as she is humble that's wise.  But they are  tightening other central banks are joining them at a time when it's not at  all clear, that the -- that the economy financial markets really need  higher interest rates it would be lovely if we had them many years ago but  not sure now is the moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a really good point and you should point out  that today the bank of Canada raised interest rates also had a pretty  hawkish assessment of the economy in Canada so you're seeing this really  across the world in terms of this idea to take back the monetary stimulus  this free money that was put in place let me ask you about this wind-down  of the balance sheet $ 41 and a half trillion balance sheet.  Are you  worried that as they wind down as they start trying to sell these -- these  securities as you say to whom, that it's going to be disruption in the  market?  </p><p>GRANT:  Yes, I think that's a real possibility Jamie Dimon was very good on  this the other day sent never before have we a balance sheet so big and  never before have we tried to shrink it and you can't be glib about the  consequences of this.  I think the fed is being happy about it wants us to  think there would no problem but, you know, it's a big world and  interconnected one the Federal reserve coughs and maybe somebody in China  sneezes, Chinese financers are very precarious the Chinese currency the  renminbi has been weakening and if the fed were to follow through it's not  all clear byu the way the fed will follow through but if fed did follow  through by shrinking its balance sheet which in a a tightening measure and  if it did raise its funds rate, perhaps China is going to become even more  precarious, so as Jamie Dimon suggested this is a maneuver never before  attempted and we can't be dogmatic we must be humble about the consequences  of what it may entail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a really prompt point, what would the  potential implications be?  Like if we see China have an impact, as the  Federal Reserve's starts unwinding the balance sheet would the impact be  securities trading down?  I mean what.</p><p>GRANT:  Sure I think it would be financial disruption globally.  And this  comes at a time when your brother in law and sister-in-law both are short  what we call on Wall Street the VIX which is the index that measures  volatility, results are very popular trade to expect that volatility will  continue to be snoozing.  It's been seemingly asleep a long time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you say if fed starts unwinding, and should we see it going  to China we'll see volatility comeback in an.</p><p>GRANT:  We will see volatility come back we might see security prices and  many different departments of the capital markets decline.  But you know,  this is -- gets back to the addendum that the fed is attaching to all of  his pledges to tighten and to shrink its balance sheet, the press release a  couple weeks ago ended in the fed's position paper a couple weeks ago on  normalizing its finances ended with a big fat paragraph describing how  quickly and how effectively it would reenter these policies that is now  talking about exiting.  You do want to begin what is normal and what is  abnormal, so the fed it says it will normalize and then says by the way if  something happens anything happens we will revise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you do as investor at this point?  </p><p>GRANT:  Yes, you do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what do you do?  I mean how do you allocate capital fixing  from equities.</p><p>GRANT:  Well OK.  So I'm going to give you an observation from history,  also 10 years ago this week that the Chuck Prince of Citicorp escorted by  the F.T. in Japan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when he bowed.</p><p>GRANT:  When the music's playing you have to get to dance.  OK, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happens when the music stops?</p><p>GRANT:  Well I think he speaks indirectly to be sure, to the seeming  necessity of being in there and playing, investors feel they have to be in  there stocks go up your neighbors getting richer, and going what your  neighbors getting richer.  Valuations seemingly have never been less  relevant because most of the time, most investors these days don't pay  attention to them ETF's index funds what have you, valuations they say are  irrelevant, Maria they're never irrelevant.  So valuations are historically  high interest rates historically low with the Fed brethren are now pledging  to tighten in a world it is not seen such things in 10 years there may be  more risk than reward in these markets. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're telling me to raise cash right now and not the  do much in terms of.</p><p>GRANT:  It's not a very thing T.V. thing to say that's what I'm saying,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Raise cash right now, you are worried Jim.</p><p>GRANT:  No I'm not worried I'm journalistically hopeful of better copy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's great to see you, you're going to be with us our special  guest on Wall Street week this week, and we'll see you later.  James Grant,  Grant Interest Rate Observer, we'll take a break when we come back Amazon  reportedly wants to build a real estate empire now, Stuart Varney has a  thing or two to say about that he will be up next.  And reshaping the  Senate picture Kid Rock drops new hints that he's looking to get into  politics.  Next, stay with us.</p><p>JONATHAN NOVACK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome  back to another Tennis Channel Court Report for FOX BUSINESS, I'm Jonathan  Novack, Sam Querrey fought back from a set down against defending champion  Andy Murray on Wednesday to reach the final four at Wimbledon.  Big Sam is  the first American man to reach the semis at major since Andy Roddick in  2009, Murray looked to be struggling with injuries the longer the match  went on but Querrey told Tennis Channel he wasn't thinking about his  opponent. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM QUERREY, AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER:  I just worried about my  game a lot of times that you try to alter game based on what the other guy  is doing or how the other guys is feeling, it makes it tougher on yourself.   So I had a game plan I have things that I work on with my coach Craig and  we and I just stuck to that out there, and, you know, I'm and it paid off. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOVACK:  Wimbledon Prime time we'll have all the action from the women's  semifinals Thursday on Tennis Channel it hits the air at 1 p.m. Eastern,  I'm Jonathan Novack.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Share of Delta Airlines are losing attitude in premarket this  morning down about two percent.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange right now looking at stocks, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  We  look at numbers that came from Delta, profit dropping 20 percent.  It was a  cost that really hurt them.  They have a lot of flight calculations in  April; the stock is down 1.7 percent this morning.  The cost that they  faced was wages and products investment as well as cancellations that  caused the airline and the company.  Overall, bright spot was unit revenue  growth and will continue to rise according to the President, going forward.   And the strength is in Latin America and domestic.  So, slightly lower  today and the transports hit a high yesterday. </p><p>Taking a look at Zillow and Amazon.  Zillow yesterday dropped four percent.   This may be the eighth day in a row.  They have been down this morning  again on news that Jeff Bezos and Amazon have moved on to a new area, real  estate, right.  We heard about them having gadgets specialists to take on  BestBuy.  Now quietly, a page on Amazon site hires a realtor.  That  appeared and then disappeared which really spooked anybody investing in  Zillow because if you hire a realtor, I don't know if you get home in an  hour like some, but I will say this is another area of expansion for Amazon  and Zillow getting hurt by it now. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the official Amazon.  Incredible, Nicole.  Thank you.   In fact, the company's Echo was one of the top products sold during Prime  Day yesterday.  Now new rumors suggest another version may be on the way.   Joining me right now host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Good  morning to you, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Can you say shifting unwanted  product?  Can you say shifting getting rid of inventory which you can't  sell?  You know, I got a feeling that is what Amazon was doing Prime Day  Sale with Echo.  They sold seven times more Echo's this year than they did  last year on Prime Day.  Now, the day after the sale ends, we find that  they're probably going to come out with a new enhanced Echo speaker in the  fall that a microphone, that a better sound quality, etc.  I feel pretty  bad if I bought an Echo yesterday and found out there was a better one  coming out in couple months.  But that is just me.</p><p>Look at that stock, $1,006 per share.  The market loves Amazon, most  important company in America, in my opinion.  What say you, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree.  It certainly is one of the most important  companies.  I think I would tend to say health care revolted companies are  among more important but Amazon is taking over the world.  And Peter  Kiernan is here, Stu.  He owns the stock and Peter just loves the story.   Don't you, Peter?</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, KIERNAN VENTURES:  Yes, I love it.   And when it knocked down 90 bucks you recall Stuart about a month ago, it  was one of the great buys of all time.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Can I put in a word for my dear friend and colleague Peter  Kiernan?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, please. </p><p>VARNEY:  He was the man who on Brexit Day, said get out there and buy  stocks because they are going up.  He was the man on November the eighth or  9th thereof the election last year who said get out there and buy stocks.   He was right on both counts, lessen to this guy. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Stuart, Maria Bartiromo said  the same thing, so.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is true.  Maria, I am awfully sorry.  I hope you didn't buy  an Echo yesterday. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, the echo improvements substitute are not so much,  are not so great.  Generation after generation that people will be fine  with the one they bought.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think this one point should be made.  I think the Echo is a very  important product.  It is part of the Amazon ecosystem locks you in, brings  you into their system, and it is a home health computer.  I think it's  going places. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, thank you.  We'll see you in 10 minutes, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart.  Coming up, Kid Rock wants to be  cowboy.  Why it's starting to look like his bid for the senate is the real  deal, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rocking Capitol Hill.  Kid rock confirming that he is making a  run for Senate in Michigan.  The musician took to twitter yesterday writing  this, \"I have had a ton of e-mails and text asking if this Website is real.   The answer is an absolute yes.\"  if Kid Rock wins, he would be the first  Republican candidate to win Senate seat since 1998.  I want to bring in the  host of Fox News Radio's, the \"TOM SHILLUE SHOW,\" an author of mean Dad for  a Better America, Tom Shillue.  Tom, thanks for joining the conversation.   What do you think what are his chances of winning?  Kid Rock. </p><p>TOM SHILLUE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  If he runs, he'll win.  I think it's  that simple.  He has got huge appeal, and he will have turnout.  That is  what you need these days is turnout and he will bring people to the polls  and he would win.  If you are a Republican, this doesn't work as well for  Democrats; celebrities, Democrats, they don't have the pulse of the  American people but Kid Rock, he is America.</p><p>And I don't think it's silly, the celebrities.  I don't mind.  I don't  care.  It is currency.  The currency is celebrity, you need money to get  into politics, and the celebrities cut out middle man. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's my only question.  Why in his right mind would he want to  be a Senator?  Mike, you are going to go down there and have to deal with  all these total pains in the, you know what, my only issue with him is can  we stop calling him a country music star?  That is not country music.   Anything that's come out of that man's mouth is not country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did he start as country music?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  It is very restricted because I don't believe in this kind  of party in the wagon, the tailgate pop that has churned out of Nashville. </p><p>BARITROMO:  But wait, then there's The Rock.  Fans of Dwayne \"Rock\" Johnson  have filed papers with the FEC to draft former pro wrestler for President  in 2020.  Would you want to smell what The Rock could be cooking in the  White House? </p><p>SHILLUE:  Why not?  Again, in this age of celebrity, Donald Trump is the  President.  It is over everybody, it is like a new era.  Celebrities and  politics crossed over.  And The Roc, I don't know what politics is.  When I  look at him, I think he's got to be conservative, right?  I mean, he is The  Rock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where is my invite?</p><p>SHILLUE:  You are coming on. </p><p>MCODWELL:  OK, I am sitting over here. </p><p>SHILLUE:  It's talk radio but I got the power of Fox News.  I', in building  so I had Greg on first show, Tucker Carlson.  I am going to be able to tap  into all talent in the building. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I am not in that league. </p><p>SHILLUE:  You are in that league.  Are you kidding me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She is the league.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  We will be listening.  Check out the Tom  Shillue Show on Fox News Radio, weekdays three to six p.m. Eastern on Fox  Radio.  We will take a break then we've got all-star panel with final  thoughts.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take you to the President who is in Paris  this morning.  Your thoughts, Senator P.</p><p>PAUL:  Macron is going to wind up being Trump's most surprisingly good  European relationship</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that, do you think so?</p><p>PAUL:  Absolutely.  He is playing the game Charles (INAUDIBLE) played for  years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks so much, have a great day.

Thanks  so much for being here.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Thursday July 27th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the east coast, there's an  earnings blitz on Wall Street today.  This is the busiest week so far for  the second quarter and among the top names reporting this morning, Twitter.   The stock is up this morning 3 percent.</p><p>Analysts are expecting earnings of 5 cents a share for the social media  giant.  And it's going to be hitting the tape momentarily.  We will bring  you the numbers as soon as they come in at the stock trades off ahead of  the report.</p><p>The packed earnings week is setting markets to all-time highs.  Take a look  at the markets here, the Dow, the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500.  All closed at all time  record highs yesterday.  And momentum is continuing this morning.  The Dow  Industrials at the Nasdaq now at the highs of the morning showing a gain at  the open of about 30 points.</p><p>In Europe stocks are mixed this morning as you see that the FTSE 100 up a  fraction as the CAC come up.  But the Dax Index in Germany is down half of  one percent.  In Asia overnight, gains across the board fractional moves,  although Hong Kong was up 3 quarters of a percent and that was the best  performer.</p><p>The health care debate is raging on, on Capitol Hill.  Senators rejected a  proposed clean repeal of Obamacare last night, lawmakers weighed in on  where reform stands now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My guess is we're going to figure out some kind of  skinny-down version.  It's disappointing to me.  But we're going to have to  keep the process moving otherwise we're stuck with the mess that is  Obamacare.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  That will be the end of single- payer health care because the money and policy will finally be out of  Washington, that's when I'm going to pursue it.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  Until we see the real bill, Democrats  will offer no further amendments.  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on health care battle coming up.  But we want to get you  the Twitter numbers right now.  The company reporting earnings of 12 cents  a share that was -- that the adjusted earnings were actually 8 cents a  share still better than estimate which called for profit of 5 cents a  share.</p><p>Revenue coming in at 574 million versus an estimate of 536 million and  active users, that's monthly active users are 328 million, the stock has  completely reversed course on these numbers right here and it is down 4.5  percent right now.  We're about to talk about it with experts in terms of  tech and market.  Stay with us on this.</p><p>Ford meanwhile is recalling over 100,000 vehicles over safety defect, what  you need to know before you hit the road.  And Bieber may need to say sorry  for this.  The details after the pop star accidentally hits a photographer  with his truck while leaving church.</p><p>Coke Zero getting a makeover, how the company hopes a new recipe and it  revamp look will help top sales.  And deals take flight.  The Southwest  Airlines offering up $45 fairs, a chance to chase a solar eclipse as well.   How you can punch your ticket coming up.  We will tell you about it.</p><p>First, though, it is a big week for second quarter earnings especially in  technology sector.  We have just heard from Twitter, the social media giant  reporting earnings -- revenue of $574 million in earnings of 8 cents a  share.  Better than expected in terms of the bottom and the top line.</p><p>The stock, however, was up 3 percent before the report came out and it's  now down 2.5 percent.</p><p>Joining us now right now is the editor of Mashable Tech, Pete Pachal is  with us, also with us are ARK Investment CEO, Cathy Wood.  Good to see you  both.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Pete, you were really focused on the monthly active users.  We got that  number 328 million for Twitter, your reaction to that report?</p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASHABLE TECH EDITOR:  I wish I knew right up -- on top of my  head --</p><p>CATHERINE WOOD, FOUNDER AND CEO AT ARK INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT:  I think it's  fairly flat.  I think it's fairly flat.</p><p>PACHAL:  -- is on that because I know they went up by 9 million last  quarter and that was a big quarter for them.  Usually, it's about 3 or 4  million.  But the revenue, great news, and it seems like that they are  turning what was a good quarter or last quarter into something that sort of  resembling momentum at the very least.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That monthly active user number according to what I'm  seeing here at 328 million is flat for the quarter.</p><p>First, we're looking for slightly higher and that's called 329 or 332.</p><p>PACHAL:  And we're kind of knew that it wasn't going to go that number  wasn't good spike.  We all kind of hoped I think investors that it was  going to keep going.  But it was basically a Trump bump from the last  quarter.  It seems like that, everyone was talking about.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now, the other interesting things that I'm seeing here,  Pete, and everyone else, is adjusted EBITDA for this quarter, what's great  and 178 million the street was looking for somewhere around 125.  And the  one issue here, though, is that next quarter is adjusted EBITDA cash flow  projection is seen 130 to 150.</p><p>Now, the street was looking for 144.1 there.  So this is the midpoint of  that is slightly light.  So, between the MAU and the cash flow projection,  I think that's where we're seeing the shortfall here that and expectations.</p><p>WOOD:  There's one of it really that's really important.  It's the daily  average users not to get too detailed --</p><p>PACHAL:  Well, they never reveal that one.</p><p>WOOD:  No.  No.  They do.  They'd have -- it had been accelerating the  growth rate bottomed out a 2 percent roughly a year, year and a half ago.   And had moved into the double digits that's a leading indicator.  We think  what's going on is a churn away from celebrities into the knowledge-worker  space.  We use Twitter all of the time.  We push our research, block chain  lives on Twitter, artificial intelligence, futile experts they live on  Twitter.</p><p>So, I really think you're having a wholesale changeover in the user base so  to a very important and valuable demographic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We agree.  We're on Twitter all of the time.  I'm live  tweeting, so as Dagen, while we are here.  But are they going to be able to  monetize it?</p><p>WOOD:  Yes.  I think so.  Let's put it this way, I run away from  advertising everywhere.  But the way Twitter is doing it and with  promotions I run into it and pay maybe a little more attention than I do  normally.  This is a demographic.  They're not going to get very many  places.  I'm not on Facebook.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Well that -- to that point that you might  get, and this is more of a question, but you might get more advertisers  flocking Twitter because at least there's inventory.  And if you can really  define who your users are better to the advertisers which again working on  their own metrics because you see Facebook has hit a ceiling which Mark  Zuckerberg talked about, he's a ceiling in terms of the ad inventory  available on news feeds.  So they are trying to push video.  And that's how  -- but that's over a two to three period year window. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PACHAL:  I think what Twitter's main product that is the stream of tweets,  it's always been extremely difficult to monetize for multiple reasons.  So  one is that, that the audience, exactly what you're talking about isn't  sort of this uniformed thing.  It's the splintered groups that are mostly  talking to each other like there's media Twitter.  We were talking about  block-chain Twitter, you know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  How do you target ads for people who hate Trump?</p><p>PACHAL:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But again, that's how they use Twitter.  It's not -- hey, what  kind of music do you like, what kind of fashion do you like, what are  shopping habits, you can't figure that out based on how somebody tweets.</p><p>WOOD:  The demographic that we're talking about, the shift towards the  knowledge workers, I think that's very important and I don't think a lot of  people understand what is happening out there, how much activity there is  out there and how valuable that information is.  The information flow that  we get is so valuable and it's not out there in the traditional financial  world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that knowledge workers, that's what advertisers want to  reach.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Right.  And celebrities can use Instagram because they  only have to take photos of themselves and they don't have the put thoughts  into words and sentences.</p><p>WOOD:  They actually use the English language.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, Twitter has some -- Twitter does have some spin  here about what we were just talking about.  Total ad engagements are up 95  percent year over year in Q2.  Video remains the largest and fastest  growing format for ads, perhaps not surprising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what she just said.  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- especially if you listen to Pete.  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the stock is plummeting down 6 percent right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And they're getting a positive response from  advertisers around like your premium video contents.  So, you know, in  terms of how do you hook them in, the video seems to be working, why is the  stock down, it is MAU --</p><p>WOOD:  MAU --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is it also the stock has been running.</p><p>WOOD:  Yes.  It had to move from 16ish, it's basing in here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PACHAL:  The video strategy is sort of finally on track.  I mean they had  to deal with the NFL and that sort of went away because there are streaming  live games.  But then they had their sort of more worldwide spread deal  with various companies including Major League Baseball and the NFL.</p><p>But it wasn't about streaming games.  It's about like the commentary, the  ancillary stuff.  And that's actually like that's the best use case for  Twitter already.  I mean whatever you're watching, you know, whether it's  Game of Thrones or, you know, a football game, you tweet -- you use Twitter  actually like watch the contents, it's more for that commentary and the  secondary stuff and that seems to be the strength of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But even the revenue is above expectations, it's down year over  year.  Revenue is down 14 percent year over year, U.S. advertising about -- </p><p>WOOD:  So, that's why there's daily average user a statistic is important.   It had been accelerating, we'll see what happens.  But the expectation was  down 11 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  It's down 14 percent.</p><p>WOOD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, there you go.  And you're going to see in the stock trade  lower.  You also have Facebook reporting earnings last night beating  expectations.  Facebook reported a 71 percent increase in profit in the  second quarter.  How much does the innovation account for these numbers.   Do you like Facebook as much as you like Twitter?</p><p>WOOD:  Yes.  We like Facebook a lot.  Obviously, the expectations there are  much higher.  We have Facebook and Twitter in our next generation and  internet found they're both in the top 10.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>WOOD:  Mobile advertising has just passed 20 percent globally.  That is S- curve territory, inflation point.  And Facebook and Google are riding the  wave.  They have of that 11 billion user networks out there, they have 10  between them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they're also leaders in Cloud, isn't that right,  Pete?</p><p>PACHAL:  Absolutely.  And now there -- I mean I am very pretty bullish on  Facebook.  I think they're one of the most innovative and social and  communication companies out there especially when you take into account all  their assets like Instagram and WhatsApp.  And it's still pretty skeptical  about Zuckerberg's long-term vision of V.R. like there's vision at ten  years from now or 20 years from now.  We're going to have like head sets  and that's how we're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Virtual reality, right.</p><p>PACHAL:  -- interact.  What I mean to power that stuff, I mean you need a  very strong cloud.  I mean streaming V.R. to phones or whatever you're  wearing is going to require a lot --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why our last guest like Cisco, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have something I said earlier because Facebook did warn that  the number of ads in its news feed is hitting a ceiling, it's focusing over  the next two to three years on video and advertising delivered through  video which is kind of a two to three-year outlook.  Messaging could yield  dividends within five years.</p><p>That stock is going to open at an all-time high this morning, at least  looking like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's up 4 percent right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Facebook is doing something really interesting lately with  Instagram which owns, you know, on every post now you can look at the  number of impressions, the reach and engagement on every post for every  individual.  So Facebook is literally through Instagram delivering metrics  to the individual about how effective your Instagram posts are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean that's -- there --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The measurement tools are incredible.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're leerily giving individual a reason to use medium as  advertising tool potentially.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what they have over some of the traditional advertise --  the traditional distribution like a television.  They come to the  advertiser and say, and now that you -- to the individual, we have metrics.   We've got the measurement tools to tell you exactly the impact of your  tweet.  Isn't that right, and oh or your post. </p><p>WOOD:  I think the mind-blowing numbers at Facebook 2 billion MAU's up 17  percent year over year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Monthly active user is incredible.  Really quick before we go,  we have to talk about the big Kahuna in the room and that is Amazon.   Amazon reports after the calls tonight.  There's the expectations right  there.  What do you think about Amazon, Pete?</p><p>PACHAL:  Well, I think, you know, the expectations seem to be good.  They  seemed to be have good guidance on it.  But the -- I think the big question  everyone has this.  The whole foods acquisition and they want to learn more  about what the short-term and long-term sort of vision is for this.</p><p>I mean, it seems in the short-term it's going to benefit whole foods a  little more with sort of access to Amazon logistics and its customer base  and sort of plugging in all that.  But the longer term, I'm really  interested in sort of like Amazon -- it seems like their first major move  to sort of like, OK, online retail works except for a couple of like key  industries, one of them being grocery shopping.  And it's like this is  their kind of, first the big move into the real word of retail it seems.   And I really, really interested in sort of the long-term vision of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you deliver fresh groceries?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They try.  They have Amazon pantry now.  But I find the whole  interface is so needlessly complicated in terms of when you go to order  things, there are all these different Amazon services.  If they kind of  write that -- the app that they use, it might be --</p><p>PACHAL:  Well, I'm more interested in being the Amazon technology to the  retail store, like the vision of Amazon Go, do you remember why people like  it's this almost super charged vision of the Apple Store where you just  kind of put stuff in your cart and go.</p><p>It's like -- I mean the thing that grocery shopping specially produce, I  mean you kind of want to see the stuff before you put it in your cart.  And  then --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we make sure it's fresh.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon bookstore is just a bookstore, by the way.</p><p>WOOD:  Nothing is fresh to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I walk around if I'm going to say a bookstore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cathy, real quick, we're at all-time highs, are you still  allocating to the new capitals in this market at these levels?</p><p>WOOD:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still like stocks?</p><p>WOOD:  Yes.  We do.  We think there's been tremendous wall of worry that's  out there.  A lot of people talk about bubble.  They remember the last  problem and we think that what -- what the market saw in the late '90s is  happening now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's a swoosh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets climb a wall of worry.  We know that.  Pete Pachal,  Cathy Wood, good to see you both.  Thank you so much.</p><p>PACHAL:  Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break, when we come back over 100,000 Ford trucks  and SUV's need to go to the shop this morning, the dangerous seatbelt  safety defect behind the recall, that's next, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An inmate who try to escape a prison on New  York's Rikers Island is back behind bars this morning, Cheryl Casone with  the story, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Yes.  So, Maria it's fascinating.  The  manhunt finally over now, but correction's officers did find 24-year-old  Naquan Hill on the island.  It happened about 2:30 a.m. this morning  eastern time.</p><p>Police say, he fled the prison last night.  He hopped a barb wire fence.   He had been locked for burglary and another charges.  During that search,  the Rikers Island was placed on a complete lock down.</p><p>Well, a safety defect is causing Ford to recall 117,000 vehicles.  The  company says the bolts in the seats -- seatbelt or seatbelt buckle can  actually fracture.  That can cause the seat to shift in a sudden stop or a  crash.</p><p>And this involves the F-Series Pickup, the E-Series Van, the Escape and the  Lincoln MKC SUV.  Customers going to be notified and dealers of course will  replace those affected bolts for free.  Just make sure you pay attention  when you get the notice in the mail.</p><p>OK.  Coca-Cola is replacing Coke Zero with Coca-Cola Zero sugar here in the  United States.  Longer name now.  This comes after foreign sales of Coca- Cola Zero sugar showed encouraging signs.  The new Diet soft drink is going  to feature more of Coca-Cola classic trade mark red wrappings.  They're  going to change the look as well.  This will hit the U.S. market next  month.  Shares of the company is about 10 percent, year to date.</p><p>Well, Southwest Airlines wants to fly you, of course, to your next  destination.  It's a 24-hour flash sale that they're operating right now.   Fair is as low at point $45 one way.  That sale ends midnight tonight.  If  you're interested, get on it now though, I should say.</p><p>Meanwhile, Southwest wants to give you a view from the sky.  There's going  to be a big solar eclipse next month.  They're selling seats on five  specific flights that will give you the best chance to see the eclipse from  the best spot, 30,000 feet.</p><p>Passengers are going to get special glasses to view the eclipse.  They're  also going to offer, this is kind of funny, cosmic cocktails on the  flights.  I don't know what's in that but it sounds fun.</p><p>Anyway, we should also say, Southwest is coming out with better than  expected earnings a few moments ago as you can see.  The stock is up 19  percent so far this year.  And Maria, but those numbers they were a beat  for Southwest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you, a lot of beats going on for the  second-quarter earning reporting period.</p><p>Coming up, musician Justin Bieber in hot water this morning after hitting  pedestrian with his car in Beverly Hills.  What happened moments before  collision, straight ahead.  And then cashing in with the clip, we are  taking a look at the business of Emojis with the start-up success in  InMoji.  We'll talk with the boss up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, Emojis are not just for fun.  They're big  business actually.  InMoji, the star of that lights brands create their own  Emoji focus marketing campaigns has raised $9.5 million in just the last  three years.</p><p>Unlike pop-up ads of old InMoji, reports that 100 percent of users that  receive an InMoji click on it and 50 percent of those user share it.   They've already created campaigns for big brands like Walmart, Starbucks  and Red Bull.</p><p>And InMoji CEO Michael Africk joins me right now to talk more about it,  Michael, great to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MICHAEL AFRICK, EMOJI CEO:  Yes.  Well, thank you so much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Walk us through this, people don't really know how it works,  how does InMoji work?</p><p>AFRICK:  Well, I mean, basically, we'd augmented the behavior that  everybody does billions of times a day already and sending Emojis.  But  what we've done is we're given the sender the ability when they click on  the icon to see a rich media campaign page.  And that campaign page could  have video, it could have a purchase ability, I could have streaming audio,  it could have a store locater like we did for Starbucks.</p><p>And then that user gets to select some content and then attach it to that  icon and send it to their friend.  Now, what we're seeing is that that  referral when someone sends to a friend because it's so highly vetted at  that receiver clicks on it 100 percent of the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So, your customer is the largely the large company with  the company that needs to continue branding itself with that?</p><p>AFRICK:  Yes.  And I think we look at this as, you know, a lot of people  like to call it the scary word ad tech.  And truthfully we see it as just  the next generation of ad tech where it does need to go because truthfully,  you can't just, you know, push brands in front of people anymore specially  now, Generation X and Z, you have to really find the right way in a  ecosystem that the users, they are -- there you have to find the right way  to approach them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  So, you're now announcing a deal with messaging app  Tango.</p><p>AFRICK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.  That puts you pass to 500 million user  mark.</p><p>AFRICK:  Yes.  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big deal, congratulations.</p><p>AFRICK:  Thank you.  Yes.  We're excited about this deal.  And it's really  for us in our growth.  This is the best integration we've had to date.   It's really our product in its best form.  And we're really thrilled with  the partnership.  And they've been great to us so far.  And we know we  launched very quietly, a couple of weeks ago.  And this is one of our big  come-out party airing the show today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is terrific.</p><p>AFRICK:  But, yes, and we're seeing just astronomical numbers when throw  but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What makes InMoji so compelling, that users and advertisers  want to go that route.  This is an evolution in terms of advertising?</p><p>AFRICK:  Yes.  And I think for users, it's expression, it's become, you  know, the best way to say what you're trying to say but not with words.   And I mean, you know, we use to walk around.  And, you know, we see --  there was a day where we used to actually hang out with each other and go  to coffee shops the other and point at things and know what we were doing  in the real world.  But all that conversation now was happening in text  messaging.</p><p>So for that, you know, to be able to actually add content and add, you  know, the contextual relevance to your conversation is what I think the  users love about it.  And then for brands, you know, really again, it is  the most innocuous way to put yourself in front of people where they can  discover you organically.  And then share you by choice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much competition in the space?  I mean you've got to be  seeing increasing companies wanting to get the piece of this action.</p><p>AFRICK:  So, I think, you know, there's a lot of companies that do a lot of  static stuff just like an Emoji or a sticker, that seems to be what people  are doing.  We've been I think creating quite a delta between us and it  would be a competitor.  There's nobody that's doing what we're doing today.   We're thrilled with that obviously.</p><p>But, you know, we see people that really think that, you know, the branding  piece has been important.  But we know there's an evolution that's coming.   And that evolution is adding that more dynamic contents so the brands can  get more are alive so that they can understand what the users are  connecting with what they're using, how they're using it, whom they're  sharing it with and that's so important, and much more important than just  seeing icon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is terrific.  Meanwhile, your career, congratulations to  you, now you're in the start-up world, you were a Disney recording artist.   You opened for Insync and Britney Spears.</p><p>AFRICK:  I did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fantastic.  How did you get in the start-up world from  there?</p><p>AFRICK:  Well, some part necessity and part just a desire to, you know,  just in my mind, one life.  I just want to do as much as I possibly could.   And that, you know, fortunately, for me and my parents made me also go to  college and try to get, you know, some business acumen in my blood.  And I  think that from that, I just had a desire to really understand more than  just music.  And I wanted to use both sides of the brain and experience a  lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you.  Michael, great to see you.  Thank you so much.   We'll be watching the success of Michael Africk, joining us InMoji is the  company.  Thank you so much.  Congrats, Michael.</p><p>We want to bring you this tweet that the president is posting right now.   President Trump is tweeting this, come on Republican senators, you can do  it on Healthcare.  After seven years, this is your chance to shine.  Don't  let the American people down.</p><p>The president is trying to get the Senate to come up with the bill that he  could sign to get this healthcare debacle behind.  We will be cover this  after the short break.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, will it be a shake-up at the White  House.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions  both in the spotlight as speculation grows over their 10 year.  How both  officials are responding?</p><p>And then Google faces out its instant search function, why the technology  is changing, next, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR:  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Thursday, July 27th.  Your top stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the East  Coast.</p><p>Earnings to focus on Wall Street this morning.  Twitter out with the report  coming at the top of the hour.  It was actually even though the numbers  look better than expected, there were no new users.  Flat user growth and  U.S. ad revenue was down 14 percent.  And as a result, we're seeing the  stocks selloff this morning, down eight percent.</p><p>Remember going into the numbers, it was up three percent, now it's down  eight and a quarter percent.  That's the low for Twitter of the morning.</p><p>A slew of a robust earnings reports so driving markets and they are driving  markets to record highs.  Look at the situation yesterday where all the  major averages closed in uncharted territory all-time highs, the Dow, the  Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P this morning continuing that momentum.  We're expecting  the Dow to open up about 30 points.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are mixed this morning.  Fractional moves in London.  The  FT 100 off a fraction, as is the CAC quarante in Paris, but the Dax Index  is down 50 points, that's one half of one percent.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, gains across the board as you see there.</p><p>From Wall Street to Washington, senate republicans continuing the fight to  repeal and replace ObamaCare after rejecting a clean repeal.  A skinny  version of the legislation is picking up steam.</p><p>President Trump just weighed in on the debate.  He tweeted out this.  \"Come  on republican senators, you can do it on health care.  After seven years,  this is your chance to shine.  Don't let the American people down.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, plugging the leaks.  White House Communications Director Anthony  Scaramucci is vowing to crack down on loose lips in the administration.   After details of his own finances were leaked to Politico.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  I applaud the  attorney general for going after the leaks.  It's super important for the  entire administration.  Some people say they were na[ve and when I've said  I'm going to get rid of the leaks, I know I'm in a cesspool called  Washington or a swamp called Washington.</p><p>So it'll be virtually impossible to get rid of every leak.  But I think we  can take dramatic steps to get rid of the leaks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The new push by Scaramucci as the administration's squashes  rumors of a shakeup in President Trump's cabinet.</p><p>A fiery crash on a Salt Lake City highway.

To recuse himself and to not know about his intention  to do so, before he was confirmed as the attorney general of the United  States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning tis former undersecretary of state for  political affairs under President Bush and Harvard Kennedy school  professor, Nicholas Burns.  Ambassador, good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us.</p><p>NICHOLAS BURNS, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS UNDER  PRESIDENT BUSH:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, let's talk about what you're hearing here.  Your  thoughts, your reaction.</p><p>BURNS:  Well, I think you're looking at an unfortunate picture of our White  House in some disarray.  The president denigration of the attorney general,  I think is unprecedented in modern American political history.</p><p>I can't remember a single example in a republican or democratic  administration where the president constantly criticizes a senior member of  the cabinet but doesn't fire him.</p><p>And so what the administration needs obviously, they need consistency.   They need a period of quiet, they need to get back to work, they need to  heal the internal ideological divisions in the White House and the  president needs to support his national security team.</p><p>So back to business, less tweeting, I think would be probably the best  recommendation for this White House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The other thing is yesterday, we heard from Senator Grassley  who said, Mr. President, there is no time this year for any confirmation  hearings.  Any anymore at this point.</p><p>So if he were to push Jeff Sessions out, he's basically looking at no  attorney general for the remainder of the year, of course Rosenstein would  probably move up and be acting attorney general, isn't that right?</p><p>BURNS:  That's correct and I thought Chairman Grassley's warning, his  public warning obviously was heard in the White House, because we're not  getting reports that the White House is pulling back on the president  firing the attorney general.</p><p>But the attorney general, Maria, he recused himself for the right reasons.   He had to recuse himself.  That's what American ethics law dictates.  And  so he made the right decision in doing that.  And President Trump just  needs to face the fact that his Russia policy is under scrutiny.</p><p>There's a bill coming up to vote this week that would sanction Russia for  its interference in our elections, 419-3.  It passed by the house by that  margin.  It passed the senate by 98 to two.</p><p>It's now coming up to a vote of the full congress.  And it's the republican  leadership essentially repudiating President Trump on foreign-policy  because President Trump has been very weak on Russia.  And I think it's  startling to see the president's own party take the step this and they're  putting in the congressional review mechanism into the bill that even if  the president tried to weaken American sanctions on Russia in the Future,  congress could then vote to block it.</p><p>We haven't seen anything like that in the sanctions legislation in a long  time in Washington.  And so I think it does tell you this is an unusual  time, a rather weak president and foreign policy and a disarray in the  White House domestically not a good picture for the United States of  America.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOREIGN POLICY/NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Ambassador, you  were at the state department for a long time, one of the things that  Secretary Tillerson said yesterday is that he would stay on as long as the  president would have him.</p><p>But one of the items that were a bit controversial for him, at least within  the White House was certifying the JCPOA, The Iran deal, which has to be  certified every 90 days.</p><p>Do you expect that to be another fight over the -- over the Iran deal the  next certification which will come up in just another 90 days?  How do you  think that affects Secretary Tillerson's tenure?</p><p>BURNS:  Well, I think it may be an internal disagreement in the  administration 90 days from now.  Look, by all appearances, the Iranians  have met the terms of this agreement.  On the nuclear side.  </p><p>And so it'd be very, very difficult for the United States to walk out  because Britain, France and Germany, our partners, would not walk out with  us.  Iran would have achieved everything it needed from this agreement and  we wouldn't.</p><p>There's a separate question here where I think the Trump administration and  Secretary Tillerson had been more effective.  And that is that Iran's a  real troublemaker in the Middle East.  It's instigating violence in Syria,  in Iraq, in Lebanon, in Yemen and I think the administration has been right  to try to push back by strengthening our relationship with the Gulf States.</p><p>So I think you have to divide the Iran issue into two parts.  But Secretary  Tillerson, if in fact he is favoring, certifying that Iran has met the  agreement, I think he's right on the facts there.  And I hope he does stay  in office.</p><p>He's someone with Secretary Mattis who, I think is represented in some  consistency and solidity for this administration which they badly need.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  Do you think maybe he was sending a message the  other day when he decided to take some time off unannounced?  It forced his  offices to come and say he's not resigning.  He's just taking a few days  off.  He's going back to Texas.</p><p>BURNS:  I don't know the details.  I just know he deserves some time off  after the incredible schedule he's kept.</p><p>Maria, I do think that Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, General  McMaster, a lot of people overseas foreign leaders have confidence in them.   It's the one part of the administration that seems to be -- these people  are working together, they're unified.  And I think the president ought to  listen to them.  And I hope Secretary Tillerson will stay in place.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Yes.  And attacking your attorney general  mercilessly on Twitter does not instill confidence and the other people who  serve you and people who might be called on to serve the American people in  the White House in months, if not years to come.</p><p>BURNS:  Well, that's exactly right.  And I think there's a foreign-policy  dimension here.  The president has been constantly criticizing NATO, the  European Union, South Korea.</p><p>If foreign leaders perceive that the president is not loyal, even to his  most loyal supporter in the cabinet, the attorney general, I think there's  a negative effect for the United States and his foreign policy in terms of  our basic credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What should he do about the leaks, ambassador?  I mean,  obviously the White House is looking to stop the leaks and they want to  step up this investigation.</p><p>A new set of homeland security report finds that there were 125 confirmed  leaks during the president's first 126 days.  Fox News is also confirming  that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is planning to step up that  investigation into the leaks.</p><p>And last night during an exclusive interview with Fox News with Sean  Hannity, White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said that  the so-called feud between Sessions and the president, he's praising the  attorney general for going after the leakers.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I know both of them so well and I know the president is upset  right now.  But my guess is, is that it will.  But if it doesn't, Sean,  it's up to the president.</p><p>I applaud the attorney general for going after the leaks.  It's super  important for the entire administration.  Even if we got the leaks, Sean,  into the bell curve of other administrations, it'd be way better for our  administration, so we've got to get that done no matter what.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scaramucci is vowing to fire anybody he feels is leaking.   After the details, his own finances were posted on Politico's Web site  yesterday.  He said in a now deleted tweet.  \"In light of the leak of my  financial disclosure information which is a felony, I'll be contacting the  FBI and the justice department.  #swamp.\"</p><p>And he also included the Twitter handout for the White House chief of  staff, Reince Priebus.</p><p>Again, that tweet was deleted but it caused some people to interpret it as  Scaramucci blaming Priebus that he wants Reince Priebus investigated.  So  he tweeted again saying this.  Wrong.  Tweet was public notice to leakers  that all senior administration officials are helping to end illegal leaks.\"</p><p>What should be done ambassador?</p><p>BURNS:  Well, obviously, if there's a leak of classified information, of  national security information, then of course people should be -- people  can't do that under U.S. law and people should be prosecuted.  That's for  the justice department to the side in any administration.</p><p>In the Anthony Scaramucci case, it's interesting in \"The New York Times\"  report this morning.  It may not have been a leak.  This is financial  information that every federal official has to present.  It's publicly  releasable within 30 days.</p><p>And so that actually might -- he may have been mistaken about that.  I  don't know all the facts, but \"The New York Times\" had a fairly compelling  and convincing article on it this morning.</p><p>But certainly, you've got to distinguish between administration officials  criticizing each other, that's not necessarily felonious but leaking  national security information, absolutely there's no place for and there's  got to be an attention by the justice department to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about this earlier that you fill out these  disclosure forms working for government, but they don't always get out.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  They shouldn't.  I mean, it's incredibly personal information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ambassador Burns saying it's not a felony.</p><p>BURNS:  It's permissible under U.S. law for that information.</p><p>If your show, Maria, asks for an information on anybody, then it's  permissible under U.S. law that that information be given to you.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  If that's the  case, why was -- ambassador, it's Mike Block.</p><p>BURNS:  Good to see you.</p><p>BLOCK:  Why was it leaked then?  What was someone trying to accomplish  here, assuming that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They wanted it out.  They wanted it out.</p><p>BLOCK:  What were they trying to do?</p><p>BURNS:  It's unclear -- well, it's unclear -- according to \"The New York  Times,\" It's unclear whether Politico requested the information under U.S.  law, then the information can be given.  Or whether someone leaked it.</p><p>So I just don't know the facts here.  But it's certainly an interesting  case.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Ambassador, are you referring to the freedom of information act  in order to get these records?  Because that can actually take some time.   It's not like news organizations typically requested and it takes some time  to get that and it doesn't have to necessarily be given.  It can be  redrafted.</p><p>BURNS:  I'm just saying if there are some questions this morning about  whether that in fact was a leak.  The general point that Maria asked about  is important.  And that is national security information has to stay within  classified in the U.S. government.  That's obviously critical.</p><p>BARTRIOMO:  Ambassador, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for  weighing in.</p><p>BURNS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ambassador Nicholas Burns there.  Stay tune tomorrow.  House  Speaker Paul Ryan will be joining me exclusively on Mornings with Maria to  discuss tax reform and health care.  Starting at 6:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Join  us for that exclusive interview tomorrow right here.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, a lot to cover this morning.   Markets are looking like they'll open in record territory.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Police are investigating a plane crash in Utah  this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  And the details are incredible  here, Maria.  Four people heading for vacation did die after their small  private plane crashed onto a busy highway, I-15.</p><p>This happened near Salt Lake City.  That plane went down shortly after  takeoff from a small airport.  It nearly missed cars when it barreled  across several lanes of traffic.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no injuries on the ground, but officials still have  no idea what caused that small plane to crash in Utah.</p><p>Well, Justin Bieber accidentally hit a photographer with his pick-up truck  last night in Beverly Hills.  So a crowds of photographers were waiting for  him.  They were standing around the singer's truck.  One of them was hit as  Bieber pulled away.</p><p>Video also shows him kneeling down beside the injured man, talking with  him.  Police say that Justin -- he fully cooperated with officers at the  scene.  We should also add that Justin Bieber was leaving a church service  when all of this happened.</p><p>Well, Google instant search is no more.  The company introduced the feature  back in 2010 but it's gone.  Now, it would always load suggestions for you  in search results automatically as you typed, but pretty -- at the time, it  was pretty exciting.  But Google is killing it because most searches now  take place on people's smart phones.</p><p>And well there be a rock on the hill?  Kid Rock has the country still in  suspense regarding his run in next year's senate election.  The rocker says  he still \"exploring the idea.\"  And in the meantime, wants to dedicate his  efforts to promote voter registration.</p><p>He is addressing the low number of registered voters.  Here's what he says.   He says, \"Although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even  registered to vote or do anything about it.\"</p><p>He plans to get people to register at concerts.  He's going to create a  non-profit organization that will dedicate itself to promote voter  registration.  All of this, Maria, is on his Web site.</p><p>But Kid Rock in congress and the senate.  It's an interesting idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure is.  A lot of people are talking about that.   Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, some football's greatest names set to be enshrined in Canton  next weekend.  The president for the Pro football Hall of Fame will join  us.  Stay with us.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, make way for seven more gridiron greats in  the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>Next Saturday, Morten Andersen, Terrell Davis, Kenny Easley, Jerry Jones,  Jason Taylor, LaDainian Tomlinson, and Kurt warner will also be enshrined  at the hall during the induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio.</p><p>I want to bring in Pro Football Hall of Fame President, David Baker.   David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BAKER, PRESIDENT, PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME:  Good to be with you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTRIOMO:  Thanks so much.  Well, an exciting moment.  So your thoughts on  the class of 2017.</p><p>BAKER:  I think it's a tremendous class of character.  You've got a  billionaire in there himself with Jerry Jones.  But each one of these guys  have tremendous stories to tell.  And what I always love about the  enshrinement, is that people at home are encouraged by their stories.</p><p>A guy like Morten Anderson who got cut at 38 and then spent his two years  just hoping he can go back and get that record.  And then when he's hooked  on, it's five more years.</p><p>There's people out there that are waiting for their call too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Very exciting.</p><p>The Arizona Cardinals will face off against the Dallas Cowboys in the  annual Pro Football Hall of Fame game at the new Tom Benson Hall of Fame  stadium two days before the induction ceremony.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  That's going to kick off the NFL's 90th season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So the choice of teams playing this year make sense since  the 2017 class included former Cardinals quarterback and the Cowboys  current owner and general manager.</p><p>So, which team is favored to win?</p><p>BAKER:  You know what?  I don't take any position.  We're just glad to have  them.  Because we have about 700,000 people descend upon this little city  of Canton.  That really stands for excellence.</p><p>BLOCK:  Fantastic.  David, what's going on -- what can you tell us about  how -- obviously football is great American institution, how is reception  at the hall of fame and in Canton had been for non-U.S. visitors?  What  kind of outreach do you do to non-U.S. potential -- </p><p>BAKER:  It's now going global.  I just got back about four weeks ago with  Robert Kraft and the New England Patriots and 18 of hour hall of famer's in  Israel for eight days.</p><p>We spent about 90 minutes with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  At the  same time, I had another eight hall of famer, he's at a private audience  with the pope, with the Vatican.</p><p>So it's a good sign that everybody loves football.  But we're excited about  it.  We're building an 800 million-dollar mixed use, kind of a Disneyland  for football, if you will.  Call Johnson Controls Hall of Fame village.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ambitious, $700 million project, right?  To expand the  campus.</p><p>BAKER:  It is.  And it's going to be really in preparation for the NFL's  100th season that will begin in two years.  And then we'll have the  centennial celebration of the NFL on September 17th in 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you worry that football as we know it will change  considerably and dramatically?  We have Jack Brewer, former pro football  player who's on the program frequently.</p><p>Yesterday, we were talking about a new study about CTE found in the brains  of 99 percent of former pro players who had died and donated their brains  to science.  Even he talks about, I wouldn't play ball, I would not play,  certainly pro ball if I have the decision to make today knowing what I know  about brain injury.</p><p>BAKER:  I think the game has changed.  I think the game should change.   It's always evolving.  I mean, we believe you make it safer by rule  changes, by equipment changes, by health protocols.</p><p>I have two boys myself who played football.  One played eight years with  the Atlanta Falcons.  And when he was at USC, they had the record for the  most consecutive wins.  My other son played at Duke, which had the record  for most consecutive losses.</p><p>But I will tell you that as a parent, I also think there's a lot of things  that are valuable in that sport.  Both of them regardless of the winning  record or the losing record, they were learning courage and character and I  believe nobility in honor.  And in a very tough world, those are things  that we want our children have today.</p><p>So I think it's a balance.  Everybody's got to make their own decision for  us.  We've been very thankful.  My boy lives next to you.  You'd have some  good neighbors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you welcome O.J. Simpson to the hall of fame?  Despite  all the legal troubles and the controversies, the Pro Football Hall of Fame  is still welcome to attend the future induction ceremonies, isn't that  right?</p><p>And he just granted parole.  Every man with the gold jacket is welcome.   But people are quite outraged by this.</p><p>BAKER:  It's not a question I worry a whole lot about.  He was enshrined in  1985, he hasn't come back once.</p><p>I will also tell you that -- again, you know, on civil liberties, people  are invited as a guest here.  I suspect you'd have him as a guess.</p><p>There's a part of me, personally, that will like to sit down and talk to  him as a man.  I think my hall of famer's aren't any different.  They're  the most elite, most competitive team in the world and they keep each other  accountable.  And so I'm sure there's a lot of them that would like to talk  to him as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really well said, David.  Great to see you.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  David Baker.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Former  Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs under George W. Bush,  Nicholas Burns joining us.  </p><p>And Pro-Football Hall of Famer President, David Baker is with us.  Plus,  Wisconsin Congressman, Sean Duffy is going to talk about that big Foxconn  plant coming.  And Former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W.  Bush, Carl Rove is with us.  </p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it, so do stay with us.  And we kick it  off right here with technology earnings in focus.  Twitter set to report  its second quarter earnings before the bell this morning. </p><p>Analysts are looking for earnings of $0.05 a share, one big thing investors  will be watching for is growth on the user-base.  Twitter surprised the  Street last quarter adding nine million monthly active users easily beating  the 2.3 million users that were expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of Facebook, take a look at this, this morning after the  social media network's second quarter earnings beat expectations, the  stocks is up three and three quarters percent.  </p><p>The company reported a $1.32 a share, joining us right now is Senior  Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax is with us.  Daniel, it's  good to see you.  </p><p>DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  It's good to see  you too Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Let's talk about technology so  far, how would you characterize it?</p><p>FLAX:  So I think Maria, if you look at the big tech giants, you have  Google, Facebook, Microsoft for example, they have had very good earnings.  </p><p>But what I think is most important is if you step back and look at the key  trends in the technology industry, you have trends around cloud, mobility,  social.  And so at Neuberger Berman, we look for companies that have been  able to build platforms. </p><p>These digital assets are able -- enable these companies to translate  revenue into outsized earnings and cash flow growth.  And so when we think  about earnings over the coming weeks and certainly what we've seen so far,  we're looking to better understand and get more insight into what these  companies are doing.</p><p>So for example, if you look at Apple, even though, of course, the market is  focused on the iPhone8 cycle over the coming 12 to 18 months, we think what  somewhat underappreciated is the value of their ecosystem.  Other key  trends within technology, security is obviously a key area.</p><p>We think a company like Cisco which is somewhat of a contrarian name has  been able to make key investments there.  One other area we point to  certainly given what's going on in the world, public safety. </p><p>And so if you look at a company like Motorola Solutions which is a leader  in that are, we think they have an underappreciated services business and  more margin potential.  So overall, we like what we see from the technology  earning so far but we're really focused on the medium to long-term view.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is it fair to say cloud and mobility, do you agree those are  the two growth stories of tech today?  Cloud and mobility?</p><p>FLAX:  Yes.  So, I think that's right.  I think basically if you look at  companies that have been able to combine the best of those elements.</p><p>So for example, you have Google or Alphabet as its now known, they have  built a tremendous cloud platform and their android operating system is  really the brains behind over 80 percent of the world's smart phones.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting, Michael.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  So Google -- Alphabet, excuse me, we saw the earnings -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Okay.</p><p>BLOCK:  The earnings -- you know what I mean.  We saw the earnings taking  quite -- a little bit negatively the other night because of rise in tech  cost and things like that.</p><p>Cost per clicks maybe going down, is that something you think is a blip and  still the long-term picture is still intact there?</p><p>FLAX:  I think Mike, I -- that the long-term picture is absolutely intact.   And there are a couple of reasons for it.</p><p>So first of all, what's going on is the business is transitioning and  growing more and more in mobile.  And so that has an impact on their  margins.  But looking at the longer-term, I think what's important here is  their assets for example in TV. </p><p>So you have the YouTube platform that they've built and that we think can  be a revenue driver over the next several years.  Another important thing  is their cloud platform and this is something that can compete with the  likes of Amazon web services and Microsoft Azure.</p><p>But more importantly, when you think about where the industry is going, you  have a situation where the Google platform, obviously the Amazon platform,  the Microsoft platform, these have the potential to drive significant  growth at all of these companies.</p><p>So we don't necessarily look at it as a winner take all but you don't have  those assets and Google as I mention I think has terrific potential.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly you mentioned YouTube and the critical  importance of video moving forward and you heard that in the Facebook  announcement because Facebook in terms of the ads in its newsfeed indicated  that it hit a ceiling and the number of ads that it can put in people's  newsfeed.</p><p>So they're looking to video and then, of course, the Messenger and the  WhatsApp Messaging app as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Putting ads in the Messenger.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of -- right.  But video is going to be the next great - - big growth driver (INAUDIBLE) in terms of ad revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  Yes.</p><p>FLAX:  Yes, I think that's right.  I think video is important and the other  thing and you've heard Facebook talk about it is building out communities.</p><p>And so the more that they're able to focus their user-base and generate  value for them in terms of bringing them together, Facebook should  ultimately be able to monetize their platform doing that overtime.  But,  yes, it takes time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you have -- you could look at the fundamentals and I'm  really glad you walk us through where you see the growth stories intact,  the fundamental story.</p><p>But you also have to look at valuations.  So out of the five largest  technology companies, and I'm including Microsoft in that list, that's $3  trillion in market value, would you buy them today?</p><p>FLAX:  So Microsoft I think is an attractive asset today.  And part of why  I say that is because we can see the growth drivers across the number of  their businesses, cloud being notable.</p><p>And so for example, if you look at their Azure platform, that has achieved  outsized growth.  And when we speak to customers, what they are telling us  is that they think Microsoft has really laid out a strategy which can help  these customers transition to the cloud.</p><p>Apple which we talked about earlier, the valuation there we think is fairly  undemanding, of course, they need to execute on their product cycles.  In  our view -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But all these companies, the top five are valued at $3  trillion.  So I mean, it's not just Microsoft, the other four as well.  Do  you think that at some point this is getting excessive or you want to be  buying these stocks today?</p><p>FLAX:  So I think if you have a 12 to 18 month horizon, these names are  attractive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FLAX:  Part of why I say that is the free cash flow generation at these  assets and then most importantly stepping back, what's happening is that  these companies are going into the physical world.  </p><p>And as we put more and more intelligence into the physical world, these  companies are able to attract and grow their profit dollars in  nontraditional areas.  And so that's why they have to look at it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a great point.  In fact, Ann Winblad from Hummer Winblad  was with us -- she's going to be with us this weekend on WALL STREET WEEK  and she said that these five companies are now really in the beating in  terms of acquiring smaller companies.</p><p>When you see these startup companies, it's not just looking for a funding,  a new rounds of funding from big private equity investors.  It's actually  the corporate that are -- they're going to spend $67 billion in investing  in R&amp;D, that's more than the federal government spent on R&amp;D last year.</p><p>FLAX:  Well I think these big companies --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These big five companies.</p><p>FLAX:  -- besides having obviously tremendous amounts of cash, they're very  long-term oriented.  And so not everything they do is going to work but I  think what has helped the five that you mentioned become so big is that  they've learned from their mistakes and that's really what's key in being  able to evolve the platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.</p><p>BLOCK:  (INAUDIBLE) though, we're talking about these large cap giant  companies and how much they spend.  You mentioned Motorola Solutions  earlier, are there other smaller companies or midcap companies that you  think might be interesting with these trends of cloud mobility social that  you discussed?</p><p>FLAX:  Sure.  So one thing we continue to like is checkpoint which is a  leading security company.  We think that name has a lot of potential to  continue to grow overtime.</p><p>We think what's important in this world that we're going into is you need  to have significant intellectual property, you have to have a customer-base  that values what you and then, of course, a roadmap to take them there  overtime.  So checkpoint is one thing we like in the midcap phase.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's good, we're glad you gave us those topics.  Let's  transition over to politics here because we've got the markets hitting all  time highs.  </p><p>Without legislative progress on tax reform and healthcare, two of President  Trump's top priorities, in fact, senate republicans are now turning their  focus to passing down what they're calling a skinny repeal, a slim down  skinny repeal of ObamaCare after another failure, failing to secure the  simple majority of 51 votes needed to pass a clean repeal of ObamaCare with  a two year delay.</p><p>Does this go into your thinking in any way in terms of the challenges we're  seeing in Washington as we see this market hit all time high?  Seven  republicans voted down the measure yesterday even though all seven voted  for repealing ObamaCare back in 2015.</p><p>Ten hours left to debate, the senate is now considering the skinny repeal  which would eliminate some of the most unpopular parts of ObamaCare  including the individual mandate and a tax on medical devices.  If they  don't end up passing anything Daniel, what does the markets do?</p><p>FLAX:  So I think Maria it's going to depend on the sector.  So technology  for example, you're going to need to see whether these companies can  innovate on their roadmaps.  </p><p>Obviously for healthcare companies depending on how the actual laws get  passed or don't get passed that will have implications for them.  When I  think about healthcare, healthcare posse, that's one element, tax policy  is, of course, critical too with the technology companies having all of  this passed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  But how much all of this is priced into these gains is  really the question?</p><p>FLAX:  I think a piece of it is priced into the gains if I reference tax  policy specifically but much of it is still to be realized overtime.  I  think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's still fundamentals that's driving it.  </p><p>FLAX:  Correct.</p><p>BLOCK:  Daniel, there's this view out there, maybe it's politically  motivated, maybe it's -- I think it's emotional that if they can't get  health -- anything done on healthcare, they can't get anything done on  taxes.  </p><p>Do you have any thoughts on that?  I personally think that one thing has  nothing to do with the other, what's your thought there?</p><p>FLAX:  So I agree with you Michael that healthcare is a separate issue.  I  think what's important with tax policy is whether the government can come  up with sensible policies that incent businesses to invest and make the  right capital allocation decisions over the medium term.</p><p>So when I think about and when we speak to companies at Neuberger, we're  constantly trying to understand where they're going with their strategies.   Tax policy is, of course, important but we want to understand the  fundamentals of their business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  It's really great to have you on the program today  Daniel, thanks so much.</p><p>FLAX:  Thanks Maria, great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Daniel Flax, Neuberger Berman.  We'll take a break.  Tragedy  strikes a state fair in Ohio.  The ride malfunction kills one man, injured  others.  Back in a minute with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ohio Governor, John Kasich is ordering rides to  be shut down after a deadly state fair accident in Ohio.  Cheryl Casone  with the story, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well that's right Maria.  And one  man is dead, at least seven others are injured after being thrown from a  ride at the Columbus Fair yesterday.</p><p>In response, Governor Kasich ordered all rides to be shut down until  thorough inspections are completed.  He says the incident is a loss for all  of Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KASICH:  It's a very tough day, a very tough night for the people of our  state because of the loss of our citizens.  Make no mistake about it, it is  s a very, very sad night for all of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well according to officials, 11 rides in the fair opened late  because inspection work was not completed on schedule.  But the ride that  malfunctioned was reportedly inspected several times.  The cause of that  malfunction at this point is unclear, they are investigating.</p><p>Well lines at airport security may become even longer.  The TSA is imposing  stricter electronic carryon screening at all airports in the U.S.   Travelers and standard checkpoint lines are going to have to remove all  electronics that are larger than a cell phone from their bags, placing them  in the bin.</p><p>The agency says its goal is to get a clear view of belongings after  intelligence has suggested that terrorists have found better ways to hide  explosives.</p><p>And then Meg Whitman is stepping down as chairman of Hewlett Packard board  which is leading, of course, to further speculation about her future.  This  comes after the CEO's name reportedly was floated as the consideration to  be the new head of Uber.</p><p>Now Whitman said in a statement that she is:</p><p>TEXT: Proud to have helped get the company off to a great start.</p><p>Now Uber says it hopes to choose a new CEO by September.</p><p>And this Anti-Trump cover from \"Rolling Stone\" is stirring up a lot of  controversy.  The magazine put Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on  the cover and asked, why can't he be our president?  </p><p>But the \"Rolling Stone\" website approach at publishing online article  titled, \"Justin Trudeau is the Canadian Prime Minister, the Free World's  Best Hope.\"  The article outlines the strict contrast between Trudeau's  liberal views and conservative policies and, of course, have been voiced by  President Trump, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say about that story.  That is such a  stupid question to ask, why can't he be our president?</p><p>BLOCK:  You want to celebrate Justin Trudeau, wonderful.  I think he has a  lot of great qualities, I think people love him.</p><p>I agree with a lot of his social policies and views.  But this whole, \"Why  can't he be our president?\"  It's like it reminds me of being stuck in a  crowd of millennial somewhere and they're talking nonsense.</p><p>ORTEGUS:  Hey, hey, hey, let's not -- </p><p>BLOCK:  If you think I'm talking about you even though it's directed on  you.  I mean come on, you're Morgan, come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh God, that's funny.</p><p>BLOCK:  You're not (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But well that one, the generalization though stuck with a crowd  --</p><p>BLOCK:  It was a generalization and -- </p><p>ORTEGUS:  Come on Michael.</p><p>BLOCK:  -- we've heard that before but I'm just saying, it's a poor aisle  headline and it's like, you want to celebrate the guy wonderful, I'll read  that.  I'm not going to read this (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Basically all it takes to get on the cover is notoriety  and you're good looking.  If that guy look like Patton Oswalt, he wouldn't  be on the cover.</p><p>No offense to Pat, I mean he's a liberal, he's funny, he wouldn't be on the  cover of \"Rolling Stone.\"  And remember they put the Boston bomber on, the  surviving Tsarnaev brother, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Am I -- I think I remember that.</p><p>BLOCK:  I guess I got the wrong look.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, made in America,  President Trump announces Foxconn will build a $10 billion factory in  Wisconsin.  We'll break down that deal next.</p><p>And then the State Department is alerting travelers on vacation in Mexico,  anybody going to Mexico to a series safety concern.  What you need to watch  out for straight ahead, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Foxconn, the company that makes Apple iPhones  announcing a $10 billion plan to build a factory in Wisconsin.  Tracee  Carrasco now with the story, Tracee good morning.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  good morning.  Yes, this is a  much needed win for President Trump.</p><p>Yesterday, he unveiled a $10 billion investment in Wisconsin by Foxconn.   The Taiwanese manufacturer that makes electronics for nearly every major  tech company including Apple, Google, and Amazon in factories in Asia,  South America, and Eastern Europe.</p><p>This move by Foxconn to open its first major factory in the United States  is a break with global manufacturing trends over the last few decades.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TERRY GOU, FOXCONN CEO:  American does not have a single LCD (INAUDIBLE) to  produce a complete AK system.  We are going to change that.</p><p>TRUMP:  It's a great day for American workers and manufacturing and for  everyone who believes in the concept and the label made in the USA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARRASCO:  The plan would be about 20 million square feet, that's three  times the size of the Pentagon, making it one of the largest manufacturing  campuses in the nation.</p><p>And while this project will -- anywhere from 3,000 to 13,000 jobs, the  company is not without problems.  In 2010, 18 employees making iPhones and  iPads at Foxconn factory in China attempted suicide at another plant in  China, underage workers as young as 14 were discovered in 2012.  There have  also been reports of fights among workers in the factories but the plan in  Wisconsin should be completed by 2020.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a big deal.</p><p>CARRASCO:  It is a big deal, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, 3,000 to 13,000 jobs?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But let's hope that Wisconsin is not like Pennsylvania because a  few years ago, I think it was 2013 Foxconn came in to Harrisburg and  promised to build a factory that would employ about 500 people, never got  built.</p><p>CARRASCO:  They're still waiting there, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they're still waiting on that factory.  It's easy to make a  promise but as this moves forward, let's see if they actually deliver on  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think this has anything -- do you think this is the same  thing we were speculating about yesterday that the president said that  Apple was going to -- built plants in the U.S. or do you think is a  separate thing?</p><p>I mean obviously this is -- did somebody confuse it?  Because yesterday the  president said that Apple was going to build plants in the U.S. and then we  never heard the confirmation from Apple.</p><p>BLOCK:  It's quite possible.  Just talking about what happened in  Pennsylvania, talk about the issues that they have abroad, I'd say Foxconn  is on notice on why we're talking about this morning because let's face it,  the labor history here is not great.</p><p>We can say it's apples to oranges, no pun intended but it's something that  we really need to keep an eye on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Foxconn did promise earlier this year to hire 50,000 U.S.  workers that was unveiled earlier so this is part of delivering on that  promise but now they have to walk that talk.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They say they're going to make screen use for automobiles,  healthcare, and other electronic devices.  So it is actually more than just  phones.  Tracee, thank you.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tracee Carrasco with that story, we'll keep watching that.   Coming up, the healthcare debate raging on with lawmakers on Capitol Hill  this morning, we're taking a look at the new polls on the legislation next.</p><p>And then the rise of Samsung, how the electronics company boosted sales and  issues with the fire prone Galaxy Note7, straight ahead, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning everybody.  Welcome back, happyThursday.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, good to have you on the program.  It is Thursday, July  27th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings  are taking the wheel on Wall Street this morning.  Twitter set to report  before the bell.  Analysts expecting earnings of $0.5 a share.  </p><p>The stock is up two percent ahead of the numbers.  A slew of robust  earnings report, in fact, driving markets to record highs.  We have another  set of all-time highs yesterday, reached up DOW Industrials continuing that  momentum this morning.  Set to open about 20 points, Nasdaq set to open up  about 30 points and S&amp;P 500 higher by 4.  In Europe stocks are mixed this  morning.  Take a look.  </p><p>The indices there show a decline in the FT 100 and the DAX Index, although  CAC quarante in Paris is up just a fraction.  In Asia overnight, gains  across the board.  On the heels of that record setting performance  yesterday on Wall Street, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong best performer  up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>From Wall Street to Washington, where the fight to repeal and replace  Obamacare rages on this morning, the senate voted against a full repeal  last night as well as a replacement.  Vice President Mike Pence spoke last  night about the difficulties of finding a solution that works for  everybody.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The Obamacare is dead.   This system is collapsing around us.  You know, there's the old saying,  that it's hard to turn a big ship at sea, but it's actually harder to turn  a sinking ship.  The reality is, members of congress have been working  carefully.  There's been very careful compromise from the majorities in the  house and now, in the senate to move the debate forward.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A new poll up this morning highlights the growing frustration  among voters over the drawn out fight over health care.  What it means for  republicans going forward.  Trouble for tourists in Mexico, the U.S. state  department warning visitors about tainted alcohol after a student was  killed and dozens others, tourists, were sickened, the new concern, coming  up.  </p><p>Scandals not slowing down, Samsung, the South Korean technology giant  posted record profits in the second quarter despite the Note 7 recall and  the bribery charges against the company's vice chairman.  Take a look at  what's fueling the growth at Samsung.  Pranks and a catch of a lifetime,  Atlanta Falcons star receiver Julio Jones hires divers after losing  $150,000 worth of jewelry in a lake.  </p><p>How it round up in the water?  First of our top story this half an hour,  plugging the leaks, White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci  is vowing to track down fire anybody who leaks within the administration.   The details on his financials, his personal financials were posted on  Politico's website yesterday.  </p><p>He said in a now deleted tweet, in light of the leak of my financial  disclosure info which is a felony, I will be contacting the FBI and the  Justice Department, #swamp.  He also included the Twitter handle for White  House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.  Again, that tweet was deleted but  some officials have interpreted that as Scaramucci blaming Priebus.  </p><p>Basically saying, Priebus is the one behind it.  He tweeted again after  that, saying this, wrong, tweet was public notice to leakers, that all  senior administration officials are helping to end illegal leaks.  Here's  what Scaramucci had to say last night on Hannity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Some people think  that we're na[ve and what I have said, I'm going to get rid of the leaks.   I know I'm in a pool called Washington or a swamp called Washington and so,  it'll be virtually impossible to get rid of every leak.  But I think we can  take dramatic steps to get rid of leaks.  </p><p>Now, one of the big problems here that I'm discovering in the Comm's team  is that senior people are really the guys doing leaking and they ask junior  people to leak for them. And so, I'm very proud to be reporting directly to  the president so that I can hermetically seal off the Comm's team from this  sort of nonsense.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning is Hillary Clinton's 2008 Presidential  Campaign Chief Strategist, the president of the Stagwell Group and Harris  Poll Chairman Mark Penn.  Mark, good to see you, thanks so much for  weighing in.</p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT, STAGWELL GROUP:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you hearing from voters?</p><p>PENN:  Well, I think, right now, the democrats have the edge on the health  care issue.  I think if you ask whether Obamacare is failing, we got in  this month's poll, 53 percent say it's not failing.  And, in fact, voters  want to keep a lot of the elements of Obamacare, except for the mandate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but can you really say it's not failing when we know that  there's absolutely no choice that insurance companies are pulling out like  wild fire and in many counties across the country only have one, if at all,  insurance company?  No choice, whatsoever.  And, of course, we know that  the premiums are up big.</p><p>PENN:  I think the point of the poll is pretty much that the republicans  have lost the advantage that they had on this issue for many years and  their own disunity is hurting them.  The republican party negatives have  plunged to 67 percent.  I don't think that's because of their positions, I  think it's because of their lack of positions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I just -- Mark, in terms of  getting their arms around the communications coming out of the White House,  do you say Karl Rove is coming up later in the show, has op-ed in \"The Wall  Street Journal\" today, saying that it's not that the president isn't  communicating enough, it's the fact that he is communicating and it's his  message that's driving down his popularity.</p><p>PENN:  Look, I think, actually, it's very, very unusual to have the economy  going in a positive direction, people think the economy is going in the  right direction and for people to be negative on the president, the  administration, but their also negative on the democrats and the  republicans.  But what change are we seeing?  </p><p>The president's down several points because, I think he's mired now in the  whole Sessions, Comey drama.  And he seems to have played in (INAUDIBLE) we  also see the republicans, I think, down from 63 percent, I think, negative  to 67 percent negative because they can't decide what they really stand  for.  And so, nothing's moving and the public is happy about the economy  and unhappy about virtually everything else.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Mark, one of  the reasons that there seems to be so much mixed messaging coming out of  the republicans is because you see so much infighting in the White House.   What Maria was alluding to earlier with the Anthony Scaramucci's tweet last  night.  I think, typically you see people in the White House coalescing  around the president and trying to protect him no matter what.  What would  be your advice for this White House team and how does Anthony Scaramucci  fix these ongoing leaks?</p><p>PENN:  Well, obviously, he's not that successful, out the gate, but I think  he's got a correct approach.  He's got to stop the leaks because otherwise,  he can't govern, he can't have advisers advice, he can't consider - if they  can't secure the White House, then they really can't move forward because  their own White House is creating the muck.  </p><p>But I don't want to -- I do want to distinguish that from what's happening  in congress.  i do think that the republican party has no clear position.   They've lost the edge on health care, democrats have a clear edge now and  something that's been unpopular for many years because of the fact they  can't agree on which way to go forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't know if you could say though the democrats have a  real edge here.  I mean, look, the democrats came up with a plan two days  ago, you know, a better future and it was all but ignored.  I mean, they  still are not coming up with a plan that will resonate for the American  people going into the 2018 midterms.  </p><p>What did you think of the plan that Chuck Schumer wrote about in his op-ed  this week, coming up with a plan to talk about jobs?  But it sounds a lot  like Donald Trump's campaign speeches and I don't know that it's actually  resonating with people that they really are serious about turning to the  economic issues that matter to the American people.</p><p>PENN:  Well, at the end of the day, almost 90 percent want the democrats  and the republicans to work together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PENN:  They do want a bipartisan solution here and it doesn't seem to be  any movement towards it and I think as the republican leadership has said,  if they can't get republicans, they better get democrats and there's no  legitimate move to do that and frankly, if you're a democrat, why would  you, in fact, move in that direction, you let the republicans have maximum  political pain before you'd even start to negotiate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about just because that's their job and they just want a  participating governing?  I mean, let's not lose sight of what the point is  here.  You're supposed to be working for the American people.  I mean, to  say why would democrats do that, to do their job?</p><p>PENN:  Well, look, 70 percent believe that Medicaid expansion shouldn't be  cut.  There's a lot of support for key elements of Obamacare here and the  democrats are standing up for that.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING:  OK.  Hey, Mark, it's Mike  Block.  You know, I get it, you know, the democrats are playing their game,  their saying, you know, the republicans don't have the votes for repeal,  personally, that makes me happy, I'm fine with that.  But the point is, why  can't they be proactive?  The graphic from your poll just shows 86 percent  wants the democrats to work.  Democrats, frankly, are standing there right  now.  They are pointing in the left, and they are point - their icing them.</p><p>PENN:  And who are you going to -</p><p>CROSSTALK</p><p>BLOCK:  And gets proactive.  McCain makes speech the other day saying,  let's reach across the aisle.  Who is going to take his hands?  Who is  going to do this?</p><p>PENN:  Well, I think some democrats would very much like to do that.  I  think keep your eyes up for -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who, which one?</p><p>PENN:   You know, but I -- but I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which democrat do you think wants to do that, Mark, seriously?</p><p>PENN:  Look, I think there is -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it Manchin?  There's one, Manchin, maybe.</p><p>PENN:  I think in the house there's a bipartisan problem-solver caucus.  I  think they look at it.  But right now, there's no atmosphere for  cooperation because the republicans are trying to solve the health care  problem on their own and their discovering they can't.  And when they come  to the conclusion and if they come to a conclusion they can't, which  they're pretty close to, they're going to have to reach out for democrats  in a real serious way and so is the administration and that is what the  American people want.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the house judiciary committee, Mark,  because they are looking into the relationship between former FBI Director  James Comey and the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign.  Republicans on the  committee voted yesterday to obtain conversations between Comey and  officials within the Obama administration.  </p><p>This, of course, comes amid reports that the 2016 democratic nominee is  focusing her upcoming memoir on how the Russia election meddling and  Comey's statements on her e-mail scandal played into her defeat to now  President Trump, your thoughts about the book that Hillary is writing and  about this new information from the judiciary committee.</p><p>PENN:  I don't know much about the book but I can say the American public  now has two minds on these investigations, almost two-thirds say these  investigations are hurting the country, all of them.  Second, when I asked  them, should they investigate something like, Clinton's uranium one deal,  almost two-thirds also say yes, just as 75 percent said yes to an  independent council.  </p><p>So the public says, yes, investigate, yes, investigate leaks, yes,  investigate Clinton's uranium one deal, yes, investigate Trump and then  they turn around and say, you know what, we've got too many investigations.   I really want taxes and infrastructure and all those good things that'll  keep our economy growing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's funny.  That is funny because you're hearing both sides of  that in the polls.  Look, these polls are really important that you're  doing, these surveys are indicating where the American people stand on all  of the stuff.  So thanks for that, Mark.</p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, good to see you, Sir Mark Penn, joining us there.   Tune in tomorrow morning.  I will sit down with House Speaker Paul Ryan, to  talk health care tax reform and a lot more.  That's tomorrow right here,  6:00 a.m. Eastern on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, our exclusive interview with the  house speaker.  </p><p>First, though, coming up next, protest in Venezuela continuing against  President Nicolas Maduro as the U.S. ordered new sanctions for  administration officials in the country and now look on foreign relations  between the two countries, straight ahead.  And then Starbucks brews up  earnings after the bell tonight and analysis of the coffee-chain's revenue  expectation.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Record highs on Wall Street again.  The Dow, the  S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ all hitting all-time highs at the close yesterday.  The  momentum is continuing this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  gain at the opening of trading as the averages continue to trade in all- time unchartered territory.  </p><p>We're looking at a couple of names this morning.  Dunkin' brands, one to  watch.  The company reported second-quarter earnings earlier this hour.   Earnings per share topped expectations but revenue was a slight miss at  Dunkin', the stock up 15 percent over the last year.  We're also watching  Starbucks this morning.  The coffee giant is also set to release its fiscal  third-quarter earnings after the bell.  Analysts are looking for earnings  of $0.55 a share.  Starbucks stock up five percent this year.</p><p>The U.S. government imposing sanctions on more than a dozen Venezuela  officials, ahead of the country's controversial vote.  Cheryl Casone with  the story now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right.  So, the Trump administration has hit 13 senior Venezuelan officials  with sanctions as the country plans to hold a national vote this Sunday.   Sanctions freeze the U.S. assets of all of those affected and it stops U.S.  entities from doing business with those same people.  The Venezuelan  government is holding the vote to rewrite the country's constitution.   Opposition groups launched a 48-hour strike yesterday.  Of course, more  protest against the vote, but, again, the situation in Venezuela and  there's video from Caracas continues to deteriorate by the day.</p><p>Well, back here at home, U.S. travelers that are going down to Mexico are  being warned not to drink the alcohol.  The State Department added the  warning to its Web site after a 20-year-old Wisconsin woman died after  being pulled out of a pool at a Mexican resort. The Milwaukee Journal said  to investigated that incident reports that more than three dozen travelers  have become sick after drinking allegedly tainted or substandard alcohol  while in the country.  So, that warning has now gone out to travelers.</p><p>OK.  Well, the headlines about Samsung this past year just they continue to  get worst for the company, frankly.  The leader jailed as part of a  corruption scandal; The Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, the focus of that big  recall after fires in the phones, but even after all that, Samsung is  reporting record quarterly earnings, and they're putting the company on  track to overtake Apple as the world's most profitably company.  And that  would end Intel's dominance in the semiconductor industry as well.  So,  some finally good news for Samsung shareholders.  </p><p>And Goldman Sachs is expanding its presence in retail.  The bank is teaming  up with Fidelity Investment to offer loans to about 6 million investors.   The company says the loans of between 75,000 to 25 million will be secured  by the borrower's portfolios, stocks, and funds.  This is Goldman's latest  attempt to reach mainstream investments without brick and mortar branches.   The stock down more than seven percent so far in 2017, excuse me, Maria.   And obviously, Goldman is trying to take a cue from the success over at  Morgan Stanley, focusing on those clients.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, apparently.  I mean, for the -- thank you, Cheryl --  forever, for the longest time, we look at Goldman as really an  institutional firm, Michael.  But little by little, last couple of years,  they've been trying to do -- trying to experiment in the retail sector.</p><p>BLOCK:  The bar or the lenders as we saw nine years ago, the taxpayers.   So, we shall see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you -- really?  Are you suggesting that, say, the stock  market is a bubble on par with what we saw in housing?</p><p>BLOCK:  Not now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And loans made -- and loans made against these assets will just  blow up in the face of Goldman Sachs?</p><p>BLOCK:  I quote Bane from Batman, \"Now is not the time for fear, that comes  later.\"  So, something is going to happen here.  It's boom-bust cycle.  I'm  a big believer in that.  We don't know what it's going to be.  It's  probably not going to be housing because everyone's watching that, maybe  it's going to be stocks, maybe it's going to be the bond market, maybe it's  going to be peer-to-peer lending.  It could be anything and I spend a lot  of my waking hours trying to figure out what's coming next.  That's a long- term gain.  And we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're spending time looking at what's coming next.   Meanwhile, the market is hitting record after record and we're in  unchartered territory once again.  And it's apparently based on  fundamentals.  We don't have a health care solution yet, we don't have tax  reform yet, and yet this market is at all-time high.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  And, you know, what I'm saying here shouldn't stop anybody.   But at the same time, at some point, things are going to come along.  Look  in 2005 and '06, there were -- there were folks who were short in financial  stocks.  Do you know what that's called?  That's called early and that's  also called wrong.  So, saying the sky is falling right now and getting  short right now, probably the wrong decision but we'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And be careful what you wish because some of that -- what if the  Congress passes some kind of nauseating health care reform that doesn't  really do a whole lot, like this market selloff because of that.  If the  Trump administration rolls out higher taxes on wealthier Americans, does  that hurt the market rather than help it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would he do that after all of those promises to take taxes down  and the biggest tax cut ever in history?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I think we learned yesterday with the announcement on  transgender individuals in the military that he just like all politicians,  backs away from promises made on the campaign trail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  And then there's Julio,  Julio Jones that would be, pulls out all the stops to find an earring worth  $150,000 that he lost in a lake.  The extreme measures the Atlanta Falcons  player took to find the missing jewelry, next.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It was a big night last night for the U.S. men's  national soccer team.  Jared max with all the details -- Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  While the San Francisco 49ers will hold  their first practice at training camp tomorrow, last night their home,  Levis Stadium was a football stadium as in soccer.  Over 63,000 squeezed  into Levi's for the Gold's Cup final against Jamaica, scoreless 45th minute  of this match until a free kick attempt by Jozy Altidore, a gorgeous goal  from 28 yards out, 1-0 USA.</p><p>Now, Jamaica leader tied the match so it was 1-1 until the 88th minute when  American Jordan Morris scores the go-ahead goal and the United States wins  the match 2-1 against Jamaica.  First title in four years for team USA in  the sixth CONCACAF Gold Cup title, one behind Mexico for the all-time lead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOZY ALTIDORE, FORWARD, TORONTO FOOTBALL CLUB:  It means a lot.  You know,  obviously everybody knows there's no secret, I haven't had the best luck  when it comes to playing international tournaments.  So, this meant a lot  to me, to be out here and to be in this moment, a great atmosphere and it's  to play a part in the game, and to have cup this -- to have this cup, it  means everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  In the last match he had been bitten by another player.  A  question, how quickly do you think you could run around the bases on a  Major League diamond?  I know some snakes move fast but watch how quickly  Diamondback shortstop Ketel Marte did it last night.  He's got to go 90  feet to first, 90 more to second, another 90 to third, and 90 more feet  home, all after hitting a baseball 360 feet, 120 yards, two run inside-the- park home run completed in under 15 seconds.  The Diamondbacks blasted the  Braves, 10-3.  </p><p>And the Texas Rangers 22-10 loss to Miami Marlins, Adrian Beltre of the  Texas Rangers was hanging out behind home plate.  You see him back there on  left side.  It only was supposed to be in the on deck circle.  So, the  second base umpire Jerry Davidson says go back where you belong, and  instead, Adrian Beltre says we'll circle back to that.  He takes the on  deck curcle and brings it toward home plate, and for that, the guy who is  now four hits away from 3,000 was ejected last night from the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Oh, my god.</p><p>MAX:  Shenanigans on the baseball diamond, Maria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like -- I like how we're making -- make -- paying attention  to, oh, you see a baseball player running fast.  We're just not used to see  it.  Oh, there are actual athletes who play professional baseball.</p><p>MAX:  After hitting -- I mean, that's really quick.  I was right on the  base on the Yankee Stadium, I nearly died by third base, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You don't get paid seven figures to basically --</p><p>MAX:  No, but I mean I'm not a complete (INAUDIBLE) you know, I mean,  thought I could move around a little bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just saying the baseball players get a free pass about  their fitness level, generally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should we talk -- wait, should we talk about the big -- who  they're calling big spender this morning?  Atlanta Falcons wide receiver  Julio Jones hires an entire dive team, all the divers went in the water to  look for a $150,000 earring.  Jones lost the earing while he was riding a  jet ski.  Unfortunately, the dive team has still not located the missing  piece of jewelry.  What do you make of it?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wait, they were his earrings?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was his earrings.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I thought maybe it was his girlfriend's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He lost it on the jet ski.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  How big could his earrings be?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how do you see $150,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they really going to find one stud of a diamond in the  bottom of the ocean?  Come on.</p><p>MAX:  There's trees down there, too, they're trying to find them through.   Not for nothing, but how dumb can you be to take $150,000 piece of jewelry  in the water.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you go jet skiing.</p><p>MAX:  Going jet skiing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, Jared, he's got it on, he's wearing it, he's not going to  take off his jewelry when he goes on the jet ski.  You have it on, you have  it on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MAX:  Oh, I disagree.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  But the divers didn't have him cost a lot.</p><p>MAX:  I used to have a family heirloom, a piece of jewelry that my  grandparents had, and the only time I would ever take it off would be when  I go to the beach.  So, you know and that thing wasn't worth $150,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Well, good point.  Jared, thank you.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good luck finding it.</p><p>MAX:  Good price to pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News headlines 24/7, Sirius  XM 115.  Don't miss my interview with Pro-football hall of famer president,  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for being  here.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 27th.   Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  There's an  earnings blip on Wall Street today.

It is Tuesday,  October 24th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings splits on Wall Street, among the big names set to report earnings  this morning, General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, and United  Technologies.  We are bringing you all of the numbers as soon as they hit  the tape and we will have the analysis as they come in.  What do the  numbers mean to you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures meanwhile showing the markets are looking higher this morning, take  a look at what we've got, this momentum lives on.  DOW Industrial set to  open up about 45 points today, Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 also in positive territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, a bit of a different story, stocks are searching for some  direction this morning.  Take a look at the euro zone where the FTSE100 is  up just a fraction and the CAC Krones and the DAX Index are up just about a  quarter of a percent or so.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you'll see taking at cue  once again.  From the U.S., the Shanghai Composite, the Nikkei Average and  the Kospi all fractionally better on the session.  The Hang Seng lower by  half a percent.  </p><p>Well the Saudi Aramco IPO is on track apparently, the public investment  fund managing director giving some hopes to big investors saying that the  oil giant's public debut is still on schedule for next year despite the  speculation that we are going to see some private investors getting on this  deal like the Chinese which may very well still be likely.</p><p>The push for tax reform is on back in the U.S., President Trump set to head  to Capitol Hill today again to something of a pep talk to encourage  republican senators to move forward on tax reform.</p><p>First daughter, Ivanka Trump spoke about the importance of getting that  reform passed, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, FIRST DAUGHTER:  The tax reform is so critical.  We're doing  it administratively deregulation.  Really fueling entrepreneurship in this  country and you see it in terms of optimism, you see it in terms of the  stock market.  </p><p>I would hear it in every conversation I had with the people through the  course of the day and in the room.  So that's what fuels us and that's what  we're fighting for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>The very latest as the House prepares to vote on that budget later this  week which will move the process forward.  </p><p>Uranium One, well the deal in question.  The House is investigating reports  this morning that an FBI informant was blocked by Obama Era Attorney  General Loretta Lynch from testifying on information that Russian nuclear  officials were involved in fraudulent dealings back in 2009.  Why he was  reportedly threatened with criminal action, we are on it this morning.</p><p>And then the quest for Amazon, the technology giant has already received  238 bids from cities hoping, looking to host the company's second U.S.  headquarters.  The details on who has the inside track coming up.  </p><p>But first, I'm coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.   We are at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this morning,  2,500 delegates are here all looking to get a piece of this action.  </p><p>There is something of a revolution going on in Saudi Arabia right now.   They are starting from scratch hoping to build industries from tourism to  medical devices, to all sorts of things that people want.  </p><p>Basically every weekend lot of Saudis leave this area and go elsewhere to  have some entertainment.  They go to Dubai, they go to Qatar, other places  other than Saudi Arabia.  Now, the leadership here is saying, \"We want our  people to spend their money here and we want foreign investments already.\"  </p><p>So you're looking at an environment right now where you've got the titans  of business here on the ground in Riyadh hoping to get a piece of this  buildup.  Buildup in infrastructure, buildup in medical technologies,  buildup in tourism.</p><p>The area is absolutely beautiful, they are creating a new city which is  going to be on the border of Egypt and Jordan right on the water and  they're hoping to put hotels, really a change in terms of culture and a  change in terms of perception.</p><p>That's why we're here today, we're getting an inside look at what's  happening, and certainly all of the names that we will be speaking with  today are going to tell us what specifically to expect as this country goes  through dramatic change in the next five years.</p><p>We'll tell you all about it in the program this morning.  Coming up, I'll  be talking with the chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, the  public investment fund, his royal highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman al- Saud.</p><p>I will speak with the crown prince, I've spent some time with him yesterday  as he explained what is taking place.  His royal highness has a vision, of  course, blessed by the king of Saudi Arabia and they are putting that  vision to work.  That is why it has attracted so many dignitaries and  delegates from around the world here this week.</p><p>I'm also speaking with Former Chairman and CEO of Arconic, Klaus Kleinfeld,  he is going to be joining me on stage along with the Chairman and CEO of  Softbank, Masayoshi Son, he is going to, of course, talk about he's  allocating capital.  He's got that $100 billion vision fund, everybody  wants to get some investment from that vision fund.</p><p>He's going to talk to us about why it is so important to invest here.  The  Saudis gave him $45 billion as part of that $100 billion vision fund.  </p><p>Also here the Blackstone Chairman and CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, he's going  to join me coming up as well.  He's on stage with me coming up along with  Boston Dynamic CEO, Marc Raibert.  </p><p>Raibert is basically talking about robotics, they're going to get robotics,  drone, the whole host of new innovative technologies working on the ground  here in Saudi.  So we're going to hear about all the investment  opportunities from this group coming up when I sit down with them on stage  momentarily.</p><p>We will bring you that conference live as it happens.  </p><p>First though, joining me from New York this morning, Fox Business Network's  Dagen McDowell.  Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.  And  TheBlaze TV Host, Lawrence Jones.  Great to see everybody.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, THEBLAZE TV HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You look fantastic as always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, incredible.  I mean markets, here we are in Saudi  Arabia, you can't believe the number of people here trying to get a piece  of the action basically because they're starting from scratch.</p><p>This is a completely changed idea in terms of what Saudi has been, a close  society, they're trying to hard to open it.  Question is, are they moving  too fast?  Will it be able to change the perception and get foreign money  coming into the country?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's a front page article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" about that very thing today Maria.  It's so amazing that you're  there that this is such a huge shift in terms of moving from investment  fund if you will that invested in the Saudi Arabia and economy.</p><p>Investing in only domestic interest say banks, even a fish farm at one  point but now trying to shift from being solely dependent on oil to  technology investment.  And the \"Journal\" points out that $3.5 billion  investment in Uber sometime last year that didn't go that well with the  ouster of the CEO of that company recently.</p><p>But I think that the amount of money at stake and the number of attendees  at this conference, it's proof of how much money Saudi Arabia is going to  be investing for decades to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And you know, the Saudis gave  Softbank $45 billion Kevin Kelly of that $100 billion vision fund.  Don't  forget, Alibaba was a big portion of the performance of that fund.</p><p>So are there other Alibaba's out there Kevin in terms of really hitting it  big to keep up that incredible performance of the vision fund?</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  What I think is pretty interesting and  unique is that most sovereign wealth funds or public investment funds they  actually go very safe and conservative route.</p><p>They have a lot of stocks, a lot of stocks, a lot of bonds, if you look at  another one that's Norway, they are very conservative.  They have almost $1  trillion.  And so this shows you the different tech that you need to do in  today's environment.</p><p>And the Saudis are leading that, right?  They're getting into venture  capital, they're getting on the edge of technology which is so important  today because we have such a dynamic shift that's happening in the  marketplace.</p><p>And I think it's important to note that this is a smart move.  Back in 2015  they realized they needed to cut their dependency on oil.  And so for 40  years they were solely focused on it.  So it 2015 they got aggressive and  they got smart and the decided to diversify.</p><p>And that's what they need to do.  So we'll have to see, there is another  Alibaba out there, can they do it with Softbank?  You know what, if history  is any guide, they're going to have a good chance.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well can we talk about tech for a second guys?  I mean  what's going on with this rollover?  We saw the worst week since around the  election for stocks like Google, Alphabet, as parents of Google, Amazon.</p><p>Going into these earnings, Amazon and Alphabet earnings, these stocks are  really rolling over.  What's going on with the broader market trading up  and technology trading down?</p><p>KELLY:  I think you're seeing a sector rotation and it's natural.  I mean  the market is up pretty significantly for the year and technology has led  that.  So people are getting into other areas of the market.</p><p>Financials actually took that leadership after they had a great earning  season but it's also important to note that there's a lot of regulatory  risk on the horizons for these technology companies.</p><p>When you started to see at Facebook, a lot of the Russian ads came in due  effect, there's talk about Amazon and whether they need to be broken up.  I  mean we didn't hear that before and that actually weighed on big tech  titans like IBM in the '60s as well as Microsoft back in the late '90s.</p><p>So this is pretty telling.  The regulatory effects is actually what's  worrying investors right now for putting new capital to work.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria, real quick in terms of earnings one thing to watch which  dovetails with where you are and the upcoming Aramco IPO that the energy  sector for the third quarter is trending up the most in terms of earnings  growth.</p><p>Earnings are expected to be up 136 percent from one year ago.  This is the  energy sector in the United States, that's up from 129 percent growth just  one month ago.  So a big rebound for energy earnings and expectations are  going up as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Wow.  One of the biggest headlines to come  out of this conference so far was that Saudi ARamco IPO was actually on  track.</p><p>So the public investment funds managing director, the oil giant's public  debut he said is still on schedule for the second half of the year, this  sovereign wealth fund is going to become one of the world's largest  investors.</p><p>And you said the \"Journal\" story today points out that the fund already had  some trouble in terms of lack (INAUDIBLE) or performances like Uber.  So  you've got Uber there, you've got this fund looking for the big highlights  in terms of where the growth comes from next.</p><p>They are all setting their sites on innovation, technology, things like  drones.  Lawrence Jones, what's on your radar this morning?</p><p>JONES:  When I look at what's on my radar, it's this stuff with Russia  considering that the Clintons had something going on that the Congress did  not know about that the FBI knew about it and now they're trying to conduct  and investigation.</p><p>But we did not know.  So that's problematic for me.  I'm interested to see  what's going to come out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're going to have more on that coming up on the program.   As you know, I interviewed John Podesta about this very subject a long time  ago.  And so we pointed out that there's something about Russia and the  democrats to talk about.</p><p>Not necessarily this administration and the Russians but we're  investigating both sides of it, so we'll come up -- come back with more on  that coming up.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a lot of earnings on the table, that's going to set the tone for  markets today as soon.  As soon as those numbers come out, we're going to  bring them to you and, of course, there's all this anticipation about the  tech earnings after the bell.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Uranium One deal in question,  the House investigating reports that an FBI informant was blocked from  testifying on information that Russian nuclear officials were involved in  fraudulent deals back in 2009 under Hillary Clinton's watch as she was  Secretary of the State.</p><p>And then let the games begin, from Coast-to-Coast, from cities big and  small, find out just how many cities are battling and trying to get  Amazon's attention for Amazon's new headquarters.</p><p>All that coming right here live from Riyadh and New York this Tuesday  morning.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>President Trump is set to announce today a title cap on the number of  refugees entering the United States.  Cheryl Casone on headlines right now  with details.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And good morning Maria.  So under these  new rules the U.S. would limit refugee admissions to 45,000 down from  110,000.</p><p>The president also expected to call for tougher vetting rules.  This comes  as the Trump Administration's 120 day refugee ban actually expires today.</p><p>Programming note for all of you, President Trump is going to be \"Lou Dobbs  Tonight\" for an exclusive interview.  That is tomorrow, 7:00p.m. Eastern  Time right here on the  FOX Business Network, don't miss that interview.</p><p>Well, Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is in Pakistan today.  He told  reporters he's going to pressure Pakistani leaders to stop the support of  the Taliban and other terrorist groups that they receive in that country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have made some very specific request  at Pakistan, this is the conditions-based approach.  And so our  relationship with Pakistan will also be conditions-based.</p><p>It will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary.   The Pakistan needs I think take a clear eye view of the situation that  they're confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations  that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  We should add that Pakistan still denies providing a safe haven  for terrorists.  </p><p>Well, Amazon says 238 cities and regions have submitted bids for its second  headquarters.  The cities include New York, Boston, Atlanta, Nashville,  Tennessee, even Austin, Texas.  And get this, Puerto Rico.  Amazon says  it's going to make a decision on the location at some point next year.  </p><p>Now technology stocks have been sinking ahead of Amazon's earnings.  Those  earnings due out Thursday after the bell.  Of course, we're going to have  them for you on FOX Business.  </p><p>And Delta Airlines is putting up the help wanted sign.  The carrier looking  to hire about a thousand flight attendants for next year and there is no  shortage of applicants, 125,000 applications have been received so far.   Delta shares about eight percent for 2017.</p><p>Also Delta is ditching Microsoft in favor of Apple.  A technology website  is reporting that Delta's only 30,000 crew members are going to get iPad  and iPhones reversing a deal with Microsoft that the carrier had announced  just four years ago.</p><p>iPads in the cockpit, I don't know Maria.  And those are your headlines  from New York.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  We are looking at this  market, really continue the momentum.  Dagen, Lawrence, Kevin, what is it  going to do at this point given that we still haven't seen the policy but  it feels like the president is trying to move up the tax reform deadline.   How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that this market does hinge on what comes out of  Washington at this point because of the continued run with stocks closing  at all time highs on Friday but DOW, Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P500.</p><p>I think that one thing that people aren't factoring in, the possibility of  the new Federal Reserve chief that because, again, as you have a Fed that  is tightening monetary policy with higher rates but also I'm trying to  unwind or begin to unwind that is $4.5 trillion balanced sheet.</p><p>They hear a lot of unknowns in there that people are not really facing at  this point and then you have like foul ups like that 401K contribution  limit that the GOP was talking about dramatically cutting and then  President Trump had to come out and say, \"No\" and put the icksnay on that.   So I think that there's a lot of room for error.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what, you make a real -- incredible points that  you're making.  In terms of the Fed chairman, when I spoke with the  president at the end of last week, he basically narrowed it down, right?</p><p>He narrowed it down to two players as well as Janet Yellen.  He talked  about Jay Powell and he talked about John Taylor.  It looks like those are  the two favorite picks.</p><p>KELLY:  Maria, and I think one thing that came really across well in that  interview is that that was very presidential of Donald Trump to give kudos  to Janet Yellen and say that he likes her.</p><p>I mean she is the sitting Fed chairman and that's very important because  you want a nice continuity.  So should he not pick her, at least it was a  great signal to the market and I think that's why you saw the market not  selloff.</p><p>But when we were talking about the markets, I mean I don't think tax reform  is as important.  And one of the reasons why we're seeing in the earnings  cycle, people are talking about how global growth is doing.</p><p>Well look at the price of copper, it's over $7,000 a ton.  It's almost near  its 20 -- late 2013 peak of $7,430.  That's showing the global growth is  strong and these companies are benefiting from it.  Should we get tax  reform?  It's icing on the cake.</p><p>JONES:  But Maria, I do think that people are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think this is a great point.  Yes.</p><p>JONES:  Yes.  Maria, I think people in the markets are optimistic about tax  reform but I think all eyes are on the city.  Remember, 200 bills passed  about the House that have died of (INAUDIBLE) in the Senate.</p><p>So a lot of people are worrying when it comes to the Senate.  But Americans  in the markets are optimistic that we could get something done.  I mean  this is something that democrats and republicans should be able to agree on  and it only strengthens the market when they see Washington working  together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so.  And he made the point of saying Rand  Paul will vote yes for tax reform.  He's focused on the Senate for sure.  </p><p>All right.  We are live form Riyadh this morning.  Let me take a short  break and come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's Tuesday morning everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We are looking at markets which are trading higher this morning.  Plus, new  allegations this morning of collusion between Russia and the Clintons.  The  House Oversight Committee is now investigating an Obama Era deal in which a  Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the United  States.</p><p>The former FBI informant who could offer more details about the deal, well  he's under a gag order apparently that prevents him from testifying before  the Congress.  The informant's lawyer question the legality of the order on  \"Lou Dobb's\" program last night, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, LAWYER:  If it does and it is unconstitutional and it's  invalid if it prohibits my client from giving information to the  legislature.  The executive cannot say to people, \"Hey, you can't give  information to another body of the government.\"</p><p>So you can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time  that all this bribery payments were made.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there's House Oversight Committee Member,  Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, he appeared on FOX News over the weekend,  he calls for the Justice Department to remove the nondisclosure agreement  which prevents the former informant from testifying about the bribery  scheme before Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBER:  This informant  wants to tell his story but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement  that was signed with the (INAUDIBLE) Justice Department.</p><p>He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta  Lynch Justice Department.  Clearly it's in the interest, in the public's  interest that this individual be able to tell the story to congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, during my exclusive interview at the end of last  week with President Trump, he told me that Special Counsel Robert Mueller  should stop probing the Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The uranium situation with  Russia getting uranium, they better look into that.  That is looking like a  very serious situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is he going to look into it?</p><p>TRUMP:   I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  That's up to them but I can  tell you Senator Grassley wants to look into it and others do but that's to  me a very, very serious charge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Lawrence Jones, let's talk about this for a second because  for years before the Clinton State Department, for years the Russians  wanted to buy uranium.  Let's just call this what it is.  Uranium is used  to make a nuclear bomb.</p><p>JONES:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they wanted to buy uranium.  They wanted to buy uranium and  president after president said, \"No, no, no, no, no, no we're not going to  sell our uranium.\"</p><p>All of a sudden under Hillary Clinton State Department, she --</p><p>JONES:  A deal was cut.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- approves 20 percent of the U.S.'s stock pile of uranium and  then she gets $140 million sent to her Clinton Foundation?</p><p>JONES:  A lot of shady business.  Now, we don't know if there was evidence  of wrong doing but there's a lot of smoke there that should have been  investigated.  </p><p>And I think it's particularly concerning Maria that Congress didn't know  anything about this but a lot of people within the department for eight  years knew this was going on and didn't report.  We've had leaks on  everything else and here was no leaks on this particular problem.</p><p>What we didn't know after looking into this when it come -- concerning this  whole uranium thing is that Obama knew as well.  He knew this and still  didn't tell Congress ,didn't notify the proper channels in this until I  think that's problematic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well it looks like a quid quo pro going on and she's  getting all that money.  She sells the uranium.  And by the way, we should  point out that the company that bought the uranium is Kremlin backed.  I  mean this was a government backed company that wanted the uranium.  </p><p>JONES:  That's correct.  And we also know now Maria because of more  investigation that the Russians were also trying to influence Hillary  Clinton as well.  That's more developments that we got out of this  particular story particularly from the Hill.</p><p>So now we know that it wasn't just Donald Trump that all these players were  trying to influence, it was everyone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we also should point out that around that same time Bill  Clinton, Former President Clinton was getting paid, what, $500,000 for a  speech in Moscow?  </p><p>JONES:  Which they did not disclose.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was getting other money.  Yes.</p><p>JONES:  Exactly.  Which they did not dis --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Separating apart from the $140 million.</p><p>JONES:  Correct Maria.  And remember, they had an agreement when this first  started that they were supposed to notify the Obama Administration to  prevent this type of wrong doing from happening.  And it looks like they  knew and didn't say anything. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All of this exchange of money and yet we're still talking  about potential collusion with the Trump Administration, incredible.</p><p>All right.  We will keep following that for you.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, is it a Snap flop?  Snap's vision for  spectacles not so clear.  We will tell you about that.</p><p>And then the fall classic may have to get a new name this year.  Why the  world series maybe hotter than ever but not for the reason that you think.   We're on it, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, everybody!  Thanks so much for joining  us.  Welcome back!  We are live this morning, it is Tuesday, October 24th,  we're coming to you from Riyadh.  Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on  the East Coast.  And earnings (INAUDIBLE) and starts on Wall Street this  morning.  </p><p>We've got General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, United Technology, just  a few of the names due out before the opening bell -- that is what's going  to set the tone for markets today.  We'll have the numbers as soon as they  hit the tape.  Eli Lili just reported minutes ago; the company beat  expectation on both earnings and revenue.  Take a look at the shares, Eli  Lili now at 87 and change.  </p><p>Earnings expected to drive markets today.  Futures are pointing higher  today, got a pretty good, firmer tone this morning on Wall Street.  Take a  look, we're at the highs of the morning right here; Dow Industrials set to  open about 55 points -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  NASDAQ,  S&amp;P500 also higher this morning, as you see there.  </p><p>In Europe, stocks are searching for direction.  In fact, the FTSE100 is not  so far away from breaking even right now.  Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE up five points; the CAC Quarante is up a third of a percent,  16 points higher; and Dax Index in Germany, up 24 right now.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly higher, as you will here.  Best performer  overnight was the Nikkei Average, up half-of-a-percent in Japan.  Some real  momentum going on in Japan, recently.  Shanghai Composite up a quarter-of- a-percent as well.</p><p>Tackling tax reform; that is the focus in the U.S.  President Trump is  taking his tax cut quest to Capitol Hill today, with something of a pep  talk to Republican Senators.  He talked about the chances of getting  through during my one-on-one exclusive interview just this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we have the votes.   We have tremendous enthusiasm this time.  Healthcare, I was told it was  tougher, but it was close.  I mean, so far, I would say it's not even a  contest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to break down the timeline for tax reform; it  could happen sooner than you think.  We'll tell you what we know now.  </p><p>Plus, reducing the reach: Facebook is testing a new feature that would  split its news feed varying publishers that don't pay up.  The social media  giant's response to the controversy this morning, coming up.  </p><p>And not sorry, Ms. Jackson; why the NFL is denying that the lead band,  Janet Jackson, amid backlash over Justin Timberlake upcoming Super Bowl  half-time show.  Remember the wardrobe malfunction a couple years ago?  All  right.  We'll get into it.  </p><p>Plus, the World Series; the hottest men ticking in town, literally.   Tonight's game, one could be the hottest start to the fall classic you've  ever seen.  We will have a preview of Astros-Dodgers showdown in Los  Angeles, coming up this morning.  </p><p>But, first, I am coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Among the big names I'll be speaking  with, coming up this morning: The Chairman of the Country's Sovereign  Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, his royal highness,  Prince Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, is with me.  I met with his royal  highness yesterday and he explained to me what the goal is, how they are  trying to get new money into the country and create some of a tourist spot  in Saudi Arabia.  We're going to tell you all about it.  </p><p>But, first, our top stories right now this half an hour: tax reform on  Capitol Hill, President Trump is set to meet with Republican Senators at  the weekly public lunch today -- that is the policy lunch.  At the top of  the agenda, a tax overhaul.  This, as Ivanka Trump touted the  administration's tax plan during a town hall event last night in  Pennsylvania, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  This tax reform really  couples two things that are really core values as a country which is work  and supporting the American family.  There are many elements of this tax  plan that, I think, are squarely targeted at creating jobs in this country,  creating growth in this country, and offering relief to our middle-income  families. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk about that and the impact on  business, the engineering and infrastructure company AECOM CEO Michael  Burke.  Michael, it's good to have you on the program today.  </p><p>MICHAEL BURKE, CEO, AECOM:  Great!  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So, I want to ask you, really,  why you would come to an investment conference like this.  I know that  infrastructure is very important all around the world, first, though, you  think the big opportunity for infrastructure is in the United States?  </p><p>BURKE:  Sure, the infrastructure opportunity right now is clearly in the  United States.  And there are many countries around the world, sovereign  wealth funds like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia here today that's looking to  invest their capital in infrastructure in the United States.  But  additionally, we are working on infrastructure projects here in the country  like the Riyadh Metro System right here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now you are -- I want to ask you about that because this  is, like, a whole new cultural change that's going on here.  But, first, in  terms of the U.S., and the tax plan, and infrastructure plan, do you expect  -- when I asked the president about this, this week, he said, yes, I'm  going to do an infrastructure plan in 2018, you wanted to see it sooner  rather than later, obviously?  </p><p>BURKE:  Certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you think it's coming?</p><p>BURKE:  It's definitely coming.  I was hoping for it to come much sooner.   I really thought it was going to be the top priority of the administration.   We have broad bipartisan support in Washington on both sides of the aisle  on Capitol Hill, and we have administrative support.  And so, we had really  a strong, strong support, and I thought it would've been top of the agenda,  but that's not the course that it took.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you see the opportunity in the U.S. in terms of  infrastructure, what do you want to see done?  I mean, are you talking  about roads, bridges, what's the big -- big idea?  </p><p>BURKE:  Yes, transportation is probably the single area that requires the  most focus, to reduce the friction on the economy but we also have an  outdated water infrastructure system across the country, we have rural  broadband that is way behind the urban environment that needs  infrastructure support.  And I really think the big idea is incenting the  private sector to bring these large pools of capital.  You hear it here  today in Riyadh; there's $22 trillion of assets represented by the people  persuaded in this conference that want to invest in infrastructure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, infrastructure, obviously, important for this  administration; what about tax reform?  How big of an impact is that going  to have on business and on economic growth?  </p><p>BURKE:  Tax reform is critical.  As you know, we have the highest corporate  tax rate among all the OECD countries, so it's critical to make sure that  the U.S. is competitive from a business attractiveness perspective.  And  ultimately, GDP growth will contribute to infrastructure growth.  So, we  have to get the economy growing, we need to have a competitive tax rate,  and that will produce jobs, produce GDP that will then fund infrastructure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that they're going to get caught up in the debates  or the pushback, like for example on the state and local tax deduction?  A  lot of people are saying, look, I'm not going to vote, yes, for that, that  means a tax increase for some of our constituents.  So, is that going to  hold up tax reform?  </p><p>BURKE:  It's one of the many challenges of tax reform.  And I think right  now, we do have both sides of the aisle that are interested in the lower  corporate rate, but we need to pay for us.  And the state tax deduction is  one of those items that are on the table, and somebody's going to have to  compromise significantly to get this across the finish line, and I expect  they'll get it done by December.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Take me to Saudi Arabia, then, tell me what you're  doing here, what you want to do here?  This is some grand ambitions to turn  Saudi Arabia into a tourist spot, open it up to foreign investment, fix in  infrastructure or create to infrastructure that doesn't exist right now in  some cities, is it doable, can they pull this off?  </p><p>BURKE:  You know, I think they can.  You know, it's an exciting time here.   They've set forth the long-term 2030 vision, and that's the start of the  plan.  And they are really focused on diversifying away from oil and they  have the right vision, and we're seeing some great ideas and we're working  on some great ideas for the country to develop new cities.  And they have  to have not only a vision, but a real differentiator, and so we're looking  at cities that will bring in robotics, and bring in a whole new host of  technologies that will differentiate them.  We're looking at new cities  that will bring entertainment into Riyadh which has long been avoided.  And  so, it's an exciting time here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  I remember saying earlier that a lot of people,  they leave every Friday, they want entertainment, and they go find it; they  find it in Dubai and elsewhere.  And now, the Saudi leadership is saying,  why are we doing this, why are we allowing all of our money to leave?  </p><p>BURKE:  We're seeing it up on the Red Sea.  And the Red Sea has beautiful,  beautiful beach fronts.  And I think these developments will be our aim to  keeping Saudis in the country when they want to take holiday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's an important plan and certainly ambitious.  Michael,  we'll be watching.  Great to have you on the program today.  </p><p>BURKE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Michael Burke, joining us there.  We'll take  a break.  When we come back, remember Janet Jackson?  There's a new Super  Bowl controversy right now.  The NFL is issuing a new statement about the  superstar, 14 years after that wardrobe malfunction with Justin Timberlake,  find out why.  And then, hungry for good news?  Well, we're keeping an eye  on Chipotle as the company reports earnings after the bell tonight.  We'll  tell you what people are expecting after a tough period for that stock,  back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for being with us  this morning.  Happy Tuesday!  We are coming to you live today from Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia.  Market is looking higher; we're at the highs of the morning  right now.  Dow Industrials set to open up 60 points; earnings in focus,  obviously.  </p><p>A couple of names we're watching related earnings.  We are watching the  companies set to report before the open today, 3M, and also looking  earnings of 2.21 a share, that, of course, the third-quarter.  Shares of 3M  are up nearly 25 percent this year.  </p><p>Also watching shares of Chipotle; the company set to report its third- quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  It's had a rough year.  Analysts  are looking for earnings of $1.63 a share.  The stock down better than 20  percent over the last year.  </p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, downplaying a test on its news feed.  You have to hear  this one, Cheryl Casone with the details in now New York, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's interesting, Maria, that Facebook test removed page post from  the news feed to a separate feed called explore.  But it's harder to find,  and the move cost a big drop in traffic in six different countries,  including Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia.  Facebook said it doesn't plan to  expand this test any further for now.  So, the test is over.  Meanwhile,  the company is said it's also experimenting with splitting its news feed in  two -- separating commercial posts from the personal news.  And its bid to  boost advertising from business -- there's the stock in the premarket up  slightly.  </p><p>Snapchat parent company, Snap, reportedly is stuck with hundreds of  thousands of unsold spectacles, that's because demand for those spectacles  quickly fell after last year's holiday shopping season.  Snap also let off  about a dozen employees that supported that division that was making the  spectacle, that happened just last month.  Taking a look at the stock,  Snap's down about 40 percent so far since the IPO, 40 percent.  </p><p>All right, now that Justin Timberlake is performing at Super Bowl, everyone  is wondering if Janet Jackson has been banned for making a guest  appearance.  You know, it's been almost 14 years since that infamous  wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl.  Well, speculation was rising  that the NFL had banned her.  The NFL is saying, though, in a statement,  nonsense, \"There's no ban.  We are not going to comment on any speculation  regarding potential guests.  There may be no guests.  Along with Pepsi,  we're excited to have Justin Timberlake.\"  Super Bowl 52, set for February  4th, guys, in Minneapolis.  </p><p>And baseball is hot right now, literally.  Los Angeles is in the grips of a  heat wave just as world series is getting underway tonight in Los Angeles.   Forecasters calling for temperatures to be near 100-degrees at game time.   The World Series record, we should add, for the hottest first-pitch  temperature was 94-degrees.  That was set in Phoenix, Arizona during game  one back in 2001, so we shall see.  First pitch tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern  Time.  And, of course, Maria, the game is going to be on Fox, back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool, all right, Cheryl, thank you.  We'll take a break when we  come back, companies such as Memphis Meats, they want to revolutionize the  way we eat.  The Venture Capital Company, 50 years, wants to revolutionize  the way we invest as well over the next 50.  Millennials and social  investing, that's next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Live from the Future Investment Initiative here  in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning, we're talking about investing  globally, doing good in the world, making money in the process, that is the  idea behind venture capital firm, 50 Years, which is backing companies that  will have global impact for the next 50 years and beyond.  Joining us right  now for the first time in Fox Business Interview is 50 Years' Founding  Partner, Seth Bannon.  And Seth, it's good to have you on the program.   Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>SETH BANNON, FOUNDING PARTNER, 50 YEARS:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were talking during the commercial break about how  millennials don't necessarily care about making money only, they want a  purpose, they want to make sure they're doing the right thing.  Most people  want to make wealth, and then commit to solving the world's problems, why  do you think you could do this both?  </p><p>BANNON:  Well, millennials certainly think: you can.  So, if you ask any  other generation: what is the purpose of business, the vast majority of  them would say, some version of to make money -- of course, that's what a  job is for.  But if you ask millennials this, and (INAUDIBLE) actually did  a study of 7,700 millennials across 29 countries, and they asked them the  open-ended question: what is the purpose of business?  </p><p>In a plurality, 47 percent said some version of to improve society or  protect the environment.  Now, millennials also think that they should make  money, but they want to have it all in careers.  And so, our fund actually  believes that companies, if they want to recruit and retain the top talent  of tomorrow, we're going to have to offer millennials what they want, which  is to combine their values with their careers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?  What should we be aware of in terms of doing  just that?  </p><p>BANNON:  So, I mean, there's a plethora of problems in the world.  And  hence, a plethora of ways that you can both make money and do good.  So, I  think we're facing an incredible climate crisis, we're facing health  problems throughout the world, we're failing to feed the world, all of  these represent massive, massive industries where you can build business  that both make billions of dollars a year, and also do a lot of good in the  process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's doing it well?  </p><p>BANNON:  Well, I always turn to our own portfolio.  One of the companies  that have been in the news recently called Memphis Meats, so they  essentially produce meats without the animal.  And so, you know, it's crazy  that in 2017 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain how you do that: produce meat without the animal, I  don't get it.  </p><p>BANNON:  Yes, so they essentially farm cells directly.  So, you can sort of  think about it this way: so, a cow is essentially being used as a piece of  technology to take plant protein inputs and then convert them into outputs  that we like to eat, drink, or wear -- in this case, meat.  And inside the  cows, there are certain biological processes happening that are causing  that transition.  And so, the idea of Memphis Meats is what if we took the  same biological processes, we'll just bring them outside of the cow so that  we can the same delicious we want just without the animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that Richard Branson and Bill Gates  have invested in this company, right?  </p><p>BANNON:  They did.  And even more interestingly, we think, is Cardio  invested in -- it's one of the largest players in conventional meat  actually investing in our last round.  And the CEO Cargo was on this  network, recently, and talked about clean meat as an inevitability, as  something that's going to happen -- it'll happen in the next couple of  years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I was laughing when I was looking at some of the research  -- well, not laughing, but you're a part of the vegan mafia in Silicon  Valley, is that true?  Is that what they call it?  </p><p>BANNON:  Yes, exactly, yes.  So, the food system is broken from top to  bottom.  And one of the largest problems is actually animal agriculture  itself.  So, many people don't know this but animal agriculture contributes  more to greenhouse gas emissions than all planes, trains, trucks, boats,  and motorcycles combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I didn't know that.</p><p>BANNON:  That's worse than all the transportation.  And it's failing to see  the world.  And factory farming has reached limits of scale, but it's still  not getting people in.  So, the vegan mafia believes that there are some  interesting solutions in either plant-based alternatives or clean meat or  what we call cellular agriculture to actually help solve these problems.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the next big wave of technology companies that you see  taking form in Silicon Valley right now?  Is this part of it, do they have  the vision to combine profit and social impact, tell us who is hot right  now, and where the next wave of growth is?  </p><p>BANNON:  We're very bullish on computational synthetic biology, we're very  bullish on space tech, we're bullish on medical devices.  Obviously,  machine learning is showing its face in every industry.  But I would say,  the single industry is we're most excited about called Cellular  Agriculture, and it's along the same lines.  It's essentially a new crop of  companies that are making the products that we all love from animals just  without the animals.  </p><p>So, we had personally invested in a company doing it for meat, the company  doing it for leather, company doing it for gelatin, company doing it for  milk proteins.  There are other companies doing it for eggs, for fish, even  for spider silk.  We think it's going to be one of the most impactful and  then profitable technology revolution that the world has ever seen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff.

It is Tuesday,  October 24th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings splits on Wall Street, among the big names set to report earnings  this morning, General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, and United  Technologies.  We are bringing you all of the numbers as soon as they hit  the tape and we will have the analysis as they come in.  What do the  numbers mean to you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Futures meanwhile showing the markets are looking higher this morning, take  a look at what we've got, this momentum lives on.  DOW Industrial set to  open up about 45 points today, Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 also in positive territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe, a bit of a different story, stocks are searching for some  direction this morning.  Take a look at the euro zone where the FTSE100 is  up just a fraction and the CAC Krones and the DAX Index are up just about a  quarter of a percent or so.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you'll see taking at cue  once again.  From the U.S., the Shanghai Composite, the Nikkei Average and  the Kospi all fractionally better on the session.  The Hang Seng lower by  half a percent.  </p><p> Well the Saudi Aramco IPO is on track apparently, the public investment  fund managing director giving some hopes to big investors saying that the  oil giant's public debut is still on schedule for next year despite the  speculation that we are going to see some private investors getting on this  deal like the Chinese which may very well still be likely.</p><p> The push for tax reform is on back in the U.S., President Trump set to head  to Capitol Hill today again to something of a pep talk to encourage  republican senators to move forward on tax reform.</p><p> First daughter, Ivanka Trump spoke about the importance of getting that  reform passed, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IVANKA TRUMP, FIRST DAUGHTER:  The tax reform is so critical.  We're doing  it administratively deregulation.  Really fueling entrepreneurship in this  country and you see it in terms of optimism, you see it in terms of the  stock market.  </p><p> I would hear it in every conversation I had with the people through the  course of the day and in the room.  So that's what fuels us and that's what  we're fighting for.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> The very latest as the House prepares to vote on that budget later this  week which will move the process forward.  </p><p> Uranium One, well the deal in question.  The House is investigating reports  this morning that an FBI informant was blocked by Obama Era Attorney  General Loretta Lynch from testifying on information that Russian nuclear  officials were involved in fraudulent dealings back in 2009.  Why he was  reportedly threatened with criminal action, we are on it this morning.</p><p> And then the quest for Amazon, the technology giant has already received  238 bids from cities hoping, looking to host the company's second U.S.  headquarters.  The details on who has the inside track coming up.  </p><p> But first, I'm coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.   We are at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this morning,  2,500 delegates are here all looking to get a piece of this action.  </p><p> There is something of a revolution going on in Saudi Arabia right now.   They are starting from scratch hoping to build industries from tourism to  medical devices, to all sorts of things that people want.  </p><p> Basically every weekend lot of Saudis leave this area and go elsewhere to  have some entertainment.  They go to Dubai, they go to Qatar, other places  other than Saudi Arabia.  Now, the leadership here is saying, \"We want our  people to spend their money here and we want foreign investments already.\"  </p><p> So you're looking at an environment right now where you've got the titans  of business here on the ground in Riyadh hoping to get a piece of this  buildup.  Buildup in infrastructure, buildup in medical technologies,  buildup in tourism.</p><p> The area is absolutely beautiful, they are creating a new city which is  going to be on the border of Egypt and Jordan right on the water and  they're hoping to put hotels, really a change in terms of culture and a  change in terms of perception.</p><p> That's why we're here today, we're getting an inside look at what's  happening, and certainly all of the names that we will be speaking with  today are going to tell us what specifically to expect as this country goes  through dramatic change in the next five years.</p><p> We'll tell you all about it in the program this morning.  Coming up, I'll  be talking with the chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, the  public investment fund, his royal highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman al- Saud.</p><p> I will speak with the crown prince, I've spent some time with him yesterday  as he explained what is taking place.  His royal highness has a vision, of  course, blessed by the king of Saudi Arabia and they are putting that  vision to work.  That is why it has attracted so many dignitaries and  delegates from around the world here this week.</p><p> I'm also speaking with Former Chairman and CEO of Arconic, Klaus Kleinfeld,  he is going to be joining me on stage along with the Chairman and CEO of  Softbank, Masayoshi Son, he is going to, of course, talk about he's  allocating capital.  He's got that $100 billion vision fund, everybody  wants to get some investment from that vision fund.</p><p> He's going to talk to us about why it is so important to invest here.  The  Saudis gave him $45 billion as part of that $100 billion vision fund.  </p><p> Also here the Blackstone Chairman and CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, he's going  to join me coming up as well.  He's on stage with me coming up along with  Boston Dynamic CEO, Marc Raibert.  </p><p> Raibert is basically talking about robotics, they're going to get robotics,  drone, the whole host of new innovative technologies working on the ground  here in Saudi.  So we're going to hear about all the investment  opportunities from this group coming up when I sit down with them on stage  momentarily.</p><p> We will bring you that conference live as it happens.  </p><p> First though, joining me from New York this morning, Fox Business Network's  Dagen McDowell.  Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.  And  TheBlaze TV Host, Lawrence Jones.  Great to see everybody.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you Maria.</p><p> LAWRENCE JONES, THEBLAZE TV HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You look fantastic as always.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, incredible.  I mean markets, here we are in Saudi  Arabia, you can't believe the number of people here trying to get a piece  of the action basically because they're starting from scratch.</p><p> This is a completely changed idea in terms of what Saudi has been, a close  society, they're trying to hard to open it.  Question is, are they moving  too fast?  Will it be able to change the perception and get foreign money  coming into the country?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's a front page article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" about that very thing today Maria.  It's so amazing that you're  there that this is such a huge shift in terms of moving from investment  fund if you will that invested in the Saudi Arabia and economy.</p><p> Investing in only domestic interest say banks, even a fish farm at one  point but now trying to shift from being solely dependent on oil to  technology investment.  And the \"Journal\" points out that $3.5 billion  investment in Uber sometime last year that didn't go that well with the  ouster of the CEO of that company recently.</p><p> But I think that the amount of money at stake and the number of attendees  at this conference, it's proof of how much money Saudi Arabia is going to  be investing for decades to come.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And you know, the Saudis gave  Softbank $45 billion Kevin Kelly of that $100 billion vision fund.  Don't  forget, Alibaba was a big portion of the performance of that fund.</p><p> So are there other Alibaba's out there Kevin in terms of really hitting it  big to keep up that incredible performance of the vision fund?</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  What I think is pretty interesting and  unique is that most sovereign wealth funds or public investment funds they  actually go very safe and conservative route.</p><p> They have a lot of stocks, a lot of stocks, a lot of bonds, if you look at  another one that's Norway, they are very conservative.  They have almost $1  trillion.  And so this shows you the different tech that you need to do in  today's environment.</p><p> And the Saudis are leading that, right?  They're getting into venture  capital, they're getting on the edge of technology which is so important  today because we have such a dynamic shift that's happening in the  marketplace.</p><p> And I think it's important to note that this is a smart move.  Back in 2015  they realized they needed to cut their dependency on oil.  And so for 40  years they were solely focused on it.  So it 2015 they got aggressive and  they got smart and the decided to diversify.</p><p> And that's what they need to do.  So we'll have to see, there is another  Alibaba out there, can they do it with Softbank?  You know what, if history  is any guide, they're going to have a good chance.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well can we talk about tech for a second guys?  I mean  what's going on with this rollover?  We saw the worst week since around the  election for stocks like Google, Alphabet, as parents of Google, Amazon.</p><p> Going into these earnings, Amazon and Alphabet earnings, these stocks are  really rolling over.  What's going on with the broader market trading up  and technology trading down?</p><p> KELLY:  I think you're seeing a sector rotation and it's natural.  I mean  the market is up pretty significantly for the year and technology has led  that.  So people are getting into other areas of the market.</p><p> Financials actually took that leadership after they had a great earning  season but it's also important to note that there's a lot of regulatory  risk on the horizons for these technology companies.</p><p> When you started to see at Facebook, a lot of the Russian ads came in due  effect, there's talk about Amazon and whether they need to be broken up.  I  mean we didn't hear that before and that actually weighed on big tech  titans like IBM in the '60s as well as Microsoft back in the late '90s.</p><p> So this is pretty telling.  The regulatory effects is actually what's  worrying investors right now for putting new capital to work.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maria, real quick in terms of earnings one thing to watch which  dovetails with where you are and the upcoming Aramco IPO that the energy  sector for the third quarter is trending up the most in terms of earnings  growth.</p><p> Earnings are expected to be up 136 percent from one year ago.  This is the  energy sector in the United States, that's up from 129 percent growth just  one month ago.  So a big rebound for energy earnings and expectations are  going up as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Wow.  One of the biggest headlines to come  out of this conference so far was that Saudi ARamco IPO was actually on  track.</p><p> So the public investment funds managing director, the oil giant's public  debut he said is still on schedule for the second half of the year, this  sovereign wealth fund is going to become one of the world's largest  investors.</p><p> And you said the \"Journal\" story today points out that the fund already had  some trouble in terms of lack (INAUDIBLE) or performances like Uber.  So  you've got Uber there, you've got this fund looking for the big highlights  in terms of where the growth comes from next.</p><p> They are all setting their sites on innovation, technology, things like  drones.  Lawrence Jones, what's on your radar this morning?</p><p> JONES:  When I look at what's on my radar, it's this stuff with Russia  considering that the Clintons had something going on that the Congress did  not know about that the FBI knew about it and now they're trying to conduct  and investigation.</p><p> But we did not know.  So that's problematic for me.  I'm interested to see  what's going to come out of it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're going to have more on that coming up on the program.   As you know, I interviewed John Podesta about this very subject a long time  ago.  And so we pointed out that there's something about Russia and the  democrats to talk about.</p><p> Not necessarily this administration and the Russians but we're  investigating both sides of it, so we'll come up -- come back with more on  that coming up.  </p><p> Meanwhile, a lot of earnings on the table, that's going to set the tone for  markets today as soon.  As soon as those numbers come out, we're going to  bring them to you and, of course, there's all this anticipation about the  tech earnings after the bell.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Uranium One deal in question,  the House investigating reports that an FBI informant was blocked from  testifying on information that Russian nuclear officials were involved in  fraudulent deals back in 2009 under Hillary Clinton's watch as she was  Secretary of the State.</p><p> And then let the games begin, from Coast-to-Coast, from cities big and  small, find out just how many cities are battling and trying to get  Amazon's attention for Amazon's new headquarters.</p><p> All that coming right here live from Riyadh and New York this Tuesday  morning.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p> President Trump is set to announce today a title cap on the number of  refugees entering the United States.  Cheryl Casone on headlines right now  with details.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And good morning Maria.  So under these  new rules the U.S. would limit refugee admissions to 45,000 down from  110,000.</p><p> The president also expected to call for tougher vetting rules.  This comes  as the Trump Administration's 120 day refugee ban actually expires today.</p><p> Programming note for all of you, President Trump is going to be \"Lou Dobbs  Tonight\" for an exclusive interview.  That is tomorrow, 7:00p.m. Eastern  Time right here on the  FOX Business Network, don't miss that interview.</p><p> Well, Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is in Pakistan today.  He told  reporters he's going to pressure Pakistani leaders to stop the support of  the Taliban and other terrorist groups that they receive in that country.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have made some very specific request  at Pakistan, this is the conditions-based approach.  And so our  relationship with Pakistan will also be conditions-based.</p><p> It will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary.   The Pakistan needs I think take a clear eye view of the situation that  they're confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations  that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  We should add that Pakistan still denies providing a safe haven  for terrorists.  </p><p> Well, Amazon says 238 cities and regions have submitted bids for its second  headquarters.  The cities include New York, Boston, Atlanta, Nashville,  Tennessee, even Austin, Texas.  And get this, Puerto Rico.  Amazon says  it's going to make a decision on the location at some point next year.  </p><p> Now technology stocks have been sinking ahead of Amazon's earnings.  Those  earnings due out Thursday after the bell.  Of course, we're going to have  them for you on FOX Business.  </p><p> And Delta Airlines is putting up the help wanted sign.  The carrier looking  to hire about a thousand flight attendants for next year and there is no  shortage of applicants, 125,000 applications have been received so far.   Delta shares about eight percent for 2017.</p><p> Also Delta is ditching Microsoft in favor of Apple.  A technology website  is reporting that Delta's only 30,000 crew members are going to get iPad  and iPhones reversing a deal with Microsoft that the carrier had announced  just four years ago.</p><p> iPads in the cockpit, I don't know Maria.  And those are your headlines  from New York.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  We are looking at this  market, really continue the momentum.  Dagen, Lawrence, Kevin, what is it  going to do at this point given that we still haven't seen the policy but  it feels like the president is trying to move up the tax reform deadline.   How do you see it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that this market does hinge on what comes out of  Washington at this point because of the continued run with stocks closing  at all time highs on Friday but DOW, Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P500.</p><p> I think that one thing that people aren't factoring in, the possibility of  the new Federal Reserve chief that because, again, as you have a Fed that  is tightening monetary policy with higher rates but also I'm trying to  unwind or begin to unwind that is $4.5 trillion balanced sheet.</p><p> They hear a lot of unknowns in there that people are not really facing at  this point and then you have like foul ups like that 401K contribution  limit that the GOP was talking about dramatically cutting and then  President Trump had to come out and say, \"No\" and put the icksnay on that.   So I think that there's a lot of room for error.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what, you make a real -- incredible points that  you're making.  In terms of the Fed chairman, when I spoke with the  president at the end of last week, he basically narrowed it down, right?</p><p> He narrowed it down to two players as well as Janet Yellen.  He talked  about Jay Powell and he talked about John Taylor.  It looks like those are  the two favorite picks.</p><p> KELLY:  Maria, and I think one thing that came really across well in that  interview is that that was very presidential of Donald Trump to give kudos  to Janet Yellen and say that he likes her.</p><p> I mean she is the sitting Fed chairman and that's very important because  you want a nice continuity.  So should he not pick her, at least it was a  great signal to the market and I think that's why you saw the market not  selloff.</p><p> But when we were talking about the markets, I mean I don't think tax reform  is as important.  And one of the reasons why we're seeing in the earnings  cycle, people are talking about how global growth is doing.</p><p> Well look at the price of copper, it's over $7,000 a ton.  It's almost near  its 20 -- late 2013 peak of $7,430.  That's showing the global growth is  strong and these companies are benefiting from it.  Should we get tax  reform?  It's icing on the cake.</p><p> JONES:  But Maria, I do think that people are --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think this is a great point.  Yes.</p><p> JONES:  Yes.  Maria, I think people in the markets are optimistic about tax  reform but I think all eyes are on the city.  Remember, 200 bills passed  about the House that have died of (INAUDIBLE) in the Senate.</p><p> So a lot of people are worrying when it comes to the Senate.  But Americans  in the markets are optimistic that we could get something done.  I mean  this is something that democrats and republicans should be able to agree on  and it only strengthens the market when they see Washington working  together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so.  And he made the point of saying Rand  Paul will vote yes for tax reform.  He's focused on the Senate for sure.  </p><p> All right.  We are live form Riyadh this morning.  Let me take a short  break and come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's Tuesday morning everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p> We are looking at markets which are trading higher this morning.  Plus, new  allegations this morning of collusion between Russia and the Clintons.  The  House Oversight Committee is now investigating an Obama Era deal in which a  Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the United  States.</p><p> The former FBI informant who could offer more details about the deal, well  he's under a gag order apparently that prevents him from testifying before  the Congress.  The informant's lawyer question the legality of the order on  \"Lou Dobb's\" program last night, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, LAWYER:  If it does and it is unconstitutional and it's  invalid if it prohibits my client from giving information to the  legislature.  The executive cannot say to people, \"Hey, you can't give  information to another body of the government.\"</p><p> So you can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time  that all this bribery payments were made.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there's House Oversight Committee Member,  Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, he appeared on FOX News over the weekend,  he calls for the Justice Department to remove the nondisclosure agreement  which prevents the former informant from testifying about the bribery  scheme before Congress.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBER:  This informant  wants to tell his story but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement  that was signed with the (INAUDIBLE) Justice Department.</p><p> He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta  Lynch Justice Department.  Clearly it's in the interest, in the public's  interest that this individual be able to tell the story to congress.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, during my exclusive interview at the end of last  week with President Trump, he told me that Special Counsel Robert Mueller  should stop probing the Uranium One deal.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The uranium situation with  Russia getting uranium, they better look into that.  That is looking like a  very serious situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is he going to look into it?</p><p> TRUMP:   I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  That's up to them but I can  tell you Senator Grassley wants to look into it and others do but that's to  me a very, very serious charge.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Lawrence Jones, let's talk about this for a second because  for years before the Clinton State Department, for years the Russians  wanted to buy uranium.  Let's just call this what it is.  Uranium is used  to make a nuclear bomb.</p><p> JONES:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they wanted to buy uranium.  They wanted to buy uranium and  president after president said, \"No, no, no, no, no, no we're not going to  sell our uranium.\"</p><p> All of a sudden under Hillary Clinton State Department, she --</p><p> JONES:  A deal was cut.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- approves 20 percent of the U.S.'s stock pile of uranium and  then she gets $140 million sent to her Clinton Foundation?</p><p> JONES:  A lot of shady business.  Now, we don't know if there was evidence  of wrong doing but there's a lot of smoke there that should have been  investigated.  </p><p> And I think it's particularly concerning Maria that Congress didn't know  anything about this but a lot of people within the department for eight  years knew this was going on and didn't report.  We've had leaks on  everything else and here was no leaks on this particular problem.</p><p> What we didn't know after looking into this when it come -- concerning this  whole uranium thing is that Obama knew as well.  He knew this and still  didn't tell Congress ,didn't notify the proper channels in this until I  think that's problematic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well it looks like a quid quo pro going on and she's  getting all that money.  She sells the uranium.  And by the way, we should  point out that the company that bought the uranium is Kremlin backed.  I  mean this was a government backed company that wanted the uranium.  </p><p> JONES:  That's correct.  And we also know now Maria because of more  investigation that the Russians were also trying to influence Hillary  Clinton as well.  That's more developments that we got out of this  particular story particularly from the Hill.</p><p> So now we know that it wasn't just Donald Trump that all these players were  trying to influence, it was everyone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we also should point out that around that same time Bill  Clinton, Former President Clinton was getting paid, what, $500,000 for a  speech in Moscow?  </p><p> JONES:  Which they did not disclose.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he was getting other money.  Yes.</p><p> JONES:  Exactly.  Which they did not dis --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Separating apart from the $140 million.</p><p> JONES:  Correct Maria.  And remember, they had an agreement when this first  started that they were supposed to notify the Obama Administration to  prevent this type of wrong doing from happening.  And it looks like they  knew and didn't say anything. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All of this exchange of money and yet we're still talking  about potential collusion with the Trump Administration, incredible.</p><p> All right.  We will keep following that for you.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, is it a Snap flop?  Snap's vision for  spectacles not so clear.  We will tell you about that.</p><p> And then the fall classic may have to get a new name this year.  Why the  world series maybe hotter than ever but not for the reason that you think.   We're on it, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, everybody!  Thanks so much for joining  us.  Welcome back!  We are live this morning, it is Tuesday, October 24th,  we're coming to you from Riyadh.  Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on  the East Coast.  And earnings (INAUDIBLE) and starts on Wall Street this  morning.  </p><p> We've got General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, United Technology, just  a few of the names due out before the opening bell -- that is what's going  to set the tone for markets today.  We'll have the numbers as soon as they  hit the tape.  Eli Lili just reported minutes ago; the company beat  expectation on both earnings and revenue.  Take a look at the shares, Eli  Lili now at 87 and change.  </p><p> Earnings expected to drive markets today.  Futures are pointing higher  today, got a pretty good, firmer tone this morning on Wall Street.  Take a  look, we're at the highs of the morning right here; Dow Industrials set to  open about 55 points -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  NASDAQ,  S&amp;P500 also higher this morning, as you see there.  </p><p> In Europe, stocks are searching for direction.  In fact, the FTSE100 is not  so far away from breaking even right now.  Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE up five points; the CAC Quarante is up a third of a percent,  16 points higher; and Dax Index in Germany, up 24 right now.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly higher, as you will here.  Best performer  overnight was the Nikkei Average, up half-of-a-percent in Japan.  Some real  momentum going on in Japan, recently.  Shanghai Composite up a quarter-of- a-percent as well.</p><p> Tackling tax reform; that is the focus in the U.S.  President Trump is  taking his tax cut quest to Capitol Hill today, with something of a pep  talk to Republican Senators.  He talked about the chances of getting  through during my one-on-one exclusive interview just this week.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we have the votes.   We have tremendous enthusiasm this time.  Healthcare, I was told it was  tougher, but it was close.  I mean, so far, I would say it's not even a  contest.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to break down the timeline for tax reform; it  could happen sooner than you think.  We'll tell you what we know now.  </p><p> Plus, reducing the reach: Facebook is testing a new feature that would  split its news feed varying publishers that don't pay up.  The social media  giant's response to the controversy this morning, coming up.  </p><p> And not sorry, Ms. Jackson; why the NFL is denying that the lead band,  Janet Jackson, amid backlash over Justin Timberlake upcoming Super Bowl  half-time show.  Remember the wardrobe malfunction a couple years ago?  All  right.  We'll get into it.  </p><p> Plus, the World Series; the hottest men ticking in town, literally.   Tonight's game, one could be the hottest start to the fall classic you've  ever seen.  We will have a preview of Astros-Dodgers showdown in Los  Angeles, coming up this morning.  </p><p> But, first, I am coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Among the big names I'll be speaking  with, coming up this morning: The Chairman of the Country's Sovereign  Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, his royal highness,  Prince Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, is with me.  I met with his royal  highness yesterday and he explained to me what the goal is, how they are  trying to get new money into the country and create some of a tourist spot  in Saudi Arabia.  We're going to tell you all about it.  </p><p> But, first, our top stories right now this half an hour: tax reform on  Capitol Hill, President Trump is set to meet with Republican Senators at  the weekly public lunch today -- that is the policy lunch.  At the top of  the agenda, a tax overhaul.  This, as Ivanka Trump touted the  administration's tax plan during a town hall event last night in  Pennsylvania, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> IVANKA TRUMP, ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  This tax reform really  couples two things that are really core values as a country which is work  and supporting the American family.  There are many elements of this tax  plan that, I think, are squarely targeted at creating jobs in this country,  creating growth in this country, and offering relief to our middle-income  families. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk about that and the impact on  business, the engineering and infrastructure company AECOM CEO Michael  Burke.  Michael, it's good to have you on the program today.  </p><p> MICHAEL BURKE, CEO, AECOM:  Great!  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So, I want to ask you, really,  why you would come to an investment conference like this.  I know that  infrastructure is very important all around the world, first, though, you  think the big opportunity for infrastructure is in the United States?  </p><p> BURKE:  Sure, the infrastructure opportunity right now is clearly in the  United States.  And there are many countries around the world, sovereign  wealth funds like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia here today that's looking to  invest their capital in infrastructure in the United States.  But  additionally, we are working on infrastructure projects here in the country  like the Riyadh Metro System right here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now you are -- I want to ask you about that because this  is, like, a whole new cultural change that's going on here.  But, first, in  terms of the U.S., and the tax plan, and infrastructure plan, do you expect  -- when I asked the president about this, this week, he said, yes, I'm  going to do an infrastructure plan in 2018, you wanted to see it sooner  rather than later, obviously?  </p><p> BURKE:  Certainly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you think it's coming?</p><p> BURKE:  It's definitely coming.  I was hoping for it to come much sooner.   I really thought it was going to be the top priority of the administration.   We have broad bipartisan support in Washington on both sides of the aisle  on Capitol Hill, and we have administrative support.  And so, we had really  a strong, strong support, and I thought it would've been top of the agenda,  but that's not the course that it took.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, where do you see the opportunity in the U.S. in terms of  infrastructure, what do you want to see done?  I mean, are you talking  about roads, bridges, what's the big -- big idea?  </p><p> BURKE:  Yes, transportation is probably the single area that requires the  most focus, to reduce the friction on the economy but we also have an  outdated water infrastructure system across the country, we have rural  broadband that is way behind the urban environment that needs  infrastructure support.  And I really think the big idea is incenting the  private sector to bring these large pools of capital.  You hear it here  today in Riyadh; there's $22 trillion of assets represented by the people  persuaded in this conference that want to invest in infrastructure. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, infrastructure, obviously, important for this  administration; what about tax reform?  How big of an impact is that going  to have on business and on economic growth?  </p><p> BURKE:  Tax reform is critical.  As you know, we have the highest corporate  tax rate among all the OECD countries, so it's critical to make sure that  the U.S. is competitive from a business attractiveness perspective.  And  ultimately, GDP growth will contribute to infrastructure growth.  So, we  have to get the economy growing, we need to have a competitive tax rate,  and that will produce jobs, produce GDP that will then fund infrastructure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think that they're going to get caught up in the debates  or the pushback, like for example on the state and local tax deduction?  A  lot of people are saying, look, I'm not going to vote, yes, for that, that  means a tax increase for some of our constituents.  So, is that going to  hold up tax reform?  </p><p> BURKE:  It's one of the many challenges of tax reform.  And I think right  now, we do have both sides of the aisle that are interested in the lower  corporate rate, but we need to pay for us.  And the state tax deduction is  one of those items that are on the table, and somebody's going to have to  compromise significantly to get this across the finish line, and I expect  they'll get it done by December.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Take me to Saudi Arabia, then, tell me what you're  doing here, what you want to do here?  This is some grand ambitions to turn  Saudi Arabia into a tourist spot, open it up to foreign investment, fix in  infrastructure or create to infrastructure that doesn't exist right now in  some cities, is it doable, can they pull this off?  </p><p> BURKE:  You know, I think they can.  You know, it's an exciting time here.   They've set forth the long-term 2030 vision, and that's the start of the  plan.  And they are really focused on diversifying away from oil and they  have the right vision, and we're seeing some great ideas and we're working  on some great ideas for the country to develop new cities.  And they have  to have not only a vision, but a real differentiator, and so we're looking  at cities that will bring in robotics, and bring in a whole new host of  technologies that will differentiate them.  We're looking at new cities  that will bring entertainment into Riyadh which has long been avoided.  And  so, it's an exciting time here. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It really is.  I remember saying earlier that a lot of people,  they leave every Friday, they want entertainment, and they go find it; they  find it in Dubai and elsewhere.  And now, the Saudi leadership is saying,  why are we doing this, why are we allowing all of our money to leave?  </p><p> BURKE:  We're seeing it up on the Red Sea.  And the Red Sea has beautiful,  beautiful beach fronts.  And I think these developments will be our aim to  keeping Saudis in the country when they want to take holiday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's an important plan and certainly ambitious.  Michael,  we'll be watching.  Great to have you on the program today.  </p><p> BURKE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Michael Burke, joining us there.  We'll take  a break.  When we come back, remember Janet Jackson?  There's a new Super  Bowl controversy right now.  The NFL is issuing a new statement about the  superstar, 14 years after that wardrobe malfunction with Justin Timberlake,  find out why.  And then, hungry for good news?  Well, we're keeping an eye  on Chipotle as the company reports earnings after the bell tonight.  We'll  tell you what people are expecting after a tough period for that stock,  back in a minute right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for being with us  this morning.  Happy Tuesday!  We are coming to you live today from Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia.  Market is looking higher; we're at the highs of the morning  right now.  Dow Industrials set to open up 60 points; earnings in focus,  obviously.  </p><p> A couple of names we're watching related earnings.  We are watching the  companies set to report before the open today, 3M, and also looking  earnings of 2.21 a share, that, of course, the third-quarter.  Shares of 3M  are up nearly 25 percent this year.  </p><p> Also watching shares of Chipotle; the company set to report its third- quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  It's had a rough year.  Analysts  are looking for earnings of $1.63 a share.  The stock down better than 20  percent over the last year.  </p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, downplaying a test on its news feed.  You have to hear  this one, Cheryl Casone with the details in now New York, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  It's interesting, Maria, that Facebook test removed page post from  the news feed to a separate feed called explore.  But it's harder to find,  and the move cost a big drop in traffic in six different countries,  including Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia.  Facebook said it doesn't plan to  expand this test any further for now.  So, the test is over.  Meanwhile,  the company is said it's also experimenting with splitting its news feed in  two -- separating commercial posts from the personal news.  And its bid to  boost advertising from business -- there's the stock in the premarket up  slightly.  </p><p>Snapchat parent company, Snap, reportedly is stuck with hundreds of  thousands of unsold spectacles, that's because demand for those spectacles  quickly fell after last year's holiday shopping season.  Snap also let off  about a dozen employees that supported that division that was making the  spectacle, that happened just last month.  Taking a look at the stock,  Snap's down about 40 percent so far since the IPO, 40 percent.  </p><p> All right, now that Justin Timberlake is performing at Super Bowl, everyone  is wondering if Janet Jackson has been banned for making a guest  appearance.  You know, it's been almost 14 years since that infamous  wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl.  Well, speculation was rising  that the NFL had banned her.  The NFL is saying, though, in a statement,  nonsense, \"There's no ban.  We are not going to comment on any speculation  regarding potential guests.  There may be no guests.  Along with Pepsi,  we're excited to have Justin Timberlake.\"  Super Bowl 52, set for February  4th, guys, in Minneapolis.  </p><p> And baseball is hot right now, literally.  Los Angeles is in the grips of a  heat wave just as world series is getting underway tonight in Los Angeles.   Forecasters calling for temperatures to be near 100-degrees at game time.   The World Series record, we should add, for the hottest first-pitch  temperature was 94-degrees.  That was set in Phoenix, Arizona during game  one back in 2001, so we shall see.  First pitch tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern  Time.  And, of course, Maria, the game is going to be on Fox, back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Cool, all right, Cheryl, thank you.  We'll take a break when we  come back, companies such as Memphis Meats, they want to revolutionize the  way we eat.  The Venture Capital Company, 50 years, wants to revolutionize  the way we invest as well over the next 50.  Millennials and social  investing, that's next, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Live from the Future Investment Initiative here  in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning, we're talking about investing  globally, doing good in the world, making money in the process, that is the  idea behind venture capital firm, 50 Years, which is backing companies that  will have global impact for the next 50 years and beyond.  Joining us right  now for the first time in Fox Business Interview is 50 Years' Founding  Partner, Seth Bannon.  And Seth, it's good to have you on the program.   Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> SETH BANNON, FOUNDING PARTNER, 50 YEARS:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were talking during the commercial break about how  millennials don't necessarily care about making money only, they want a  purpose, they want to make sure they're doing the right thing.  Most people  want to make wealth, and then commit to solving the world's problems, why  do you think you could do this both?  </p><p> BANNON:  Well, millennials certainly think: you can.  So, if you ask any  other generation: what is the purpose of business, the vast majority of  them would say, some version of to make money -- of course, that's what a  job is for.  But if you ask millennials this, and (INAUDIBLE) actually did  a study of 7,700 millennials across 29 countries, and they asked them the  open-ended question: what is the purpose of business?  </p><p> In a plurality, 47 percent said some version of to improve society or  protect the environment.  Now, millennials also think that they should make  money, but they want to have it all in careers.  And so, our fund actually  believes that companies, if they want to recruit and retain the top talent  of tomorrow, we're going to have to offer millennials what they want, which  is to combine their values with their careers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?  What should we be aware of in terms of doing  just that?  </p><p> BANNON:  So, I mean, there's a plethora of problems in the world.  And  hence, a plethora of ways that you can both make money and do good.  So, I  think we're facing an incredible climate crisis, we're facing health  problems throughout the world, we're failing to feed the world, all of  these represent massive, massive industries where you can build business  that both make billions of dollars a year, and also do a lot of good in the  process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who's doing it well?  </p><p> BANNON:  Well, I always turn to our own portfolio.  One of the companies  that have been in the news recently called Memphis Meats, so they  essentially produce meats without the animal.  And so, you know, it's crazy  that in 2017 -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Explain how you do that: produce meat without the animal, I  don't get it.  </p><p> BANNON:  Yes, so they essentially farm cells directly.  So, you can sort of  think about it this way: so, a cow is essentially being used as a piece of  technology to take plant protein inputs and then convert them into outputs  that we like to eat, drink, or wear -- in this case, meat.  And inside the  cows, there are certain biological processes happening that are causing  that transition.  And so, the idea of Memphis Meats is what if we took the  same biological processes, we'll just bring them outside of the cow so that  we can the same delicious we want just without the animals.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that Richard Branson and Bill Gates  have invested in this company, right?  </p><p> BANNON:  They did.  And even more interestingly, we think, is Cardio  invested in -- it's one of the largest players in conventional meat  actually investing in our last round.  And the CEO Cargo was on this  network, recently, and talked about clean meat as an inevitability, as  something that's going to happen -- it'll happen in the next couple of  years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I was laughing when I was looking at some of the research  -- well, not laughing, but you're a part of the vegan mafia in Silicon  Valley, is that true?  Is that what they call it?  </p><p> BANNON:  Yes, exactly, yes.  So, the food system is broken from top to  bottom.  And one of the largest problems is actually animal agriculture  itself.  So, many people don't know this but animal agriculture contributes  more to greenhouse gas emissions than all planes, trains, trucks, boats,  and motorcycles combined.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, I didn't know that.</p><p> BANNON:  That's worse than all the transportation.  And it's failing to see  the world.  And factory farming has reached limits of scale, but it's still  not getting people in.  So, the vegan mafia believes that there are some  interesting solutions in either plant-based alternatives or clean meat or  what we call cellular agriculture to actually help solve these problems.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the next big wave of technology companies that you see  taking form in Silicon Valley right now?  Is this part of it, do they have  the vision to combine profit and social impact, tell us who is hot right  now, and where the next wave of growth is?  </p><p> BANNON:  We're very bullish on computational synthetic biology, we're very  bullish on space tech, we're bullish on medical devices.  Obviously,  machine learning is showing its face in every industry.  But I would say,  the single industry is we're most excited about called Cellular  Agriculture, and it's along the same lines.  It's essentially a new crop of  companies that are making the products that we all love from animals just  without the animals.  </p><p> So, we had personally invested in a company doing it for meat, the company  doing it for leather, company doing it for gelatin, company doing it for  milk proteins.  There are other companies doing it for eggs, for fish, even  for spider silk.  We think it's going to be one of the most impactful and  then profitable technology revolution that the world has ever seen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff.  Seth, thank so much for sharing.  </p><p> BANNON:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much, Seth Bannon, joining  us there.  Coming up, I will have much more live from the Future Investment  Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  I'll be talking with the Chairman  of the country's Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, his  Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, will join me  on stage along with Steve Schwartzman, and Masayoshi Son from Softbank, we  will talk about the new ambitious plans coming out of Saudi Arabia coming  up next, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, welcome back!  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, October 24th.   Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings split on  Wall Street.

It is Tuesday,  October 24th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings splits on Wall Street, among the big names set to report earnings  this morning, General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, and United  Technologies.  We are bringing you all of the numbers as soon as they hit  the tape and we will have the analysis as they come in.  What do the  numbers mean to you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures meanwhile showing the markets are looking higher this morning, take  a look at what we've got, this momentum lives on.  DOW Industrial set to  open up about 45 points today, Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 also in positive territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, a bit of a different story, stocks are searching for some  direction this morning.  Take a look at the euro zone where the FTSE100 is  up just a fraction and the CAC Krones and the DAX Index are up just about a  quarter of a percent or so.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you'll see taking at cue  once again.  From the U.S., the Shanghai Composite, the Nikkei Average and  the Kospi all fractionally better on the session.  The Hang Seng lower by  half a percent.  </p><p>Well the Saudi Aramco IPO is on track apparently, the public investment  fund managing director giving some hopes to big investors saying that the  oil giant's public debut is still on schedule for next year despite the  speculation that we are going to see some private investors getting on this  deal like the Chinese which may very well still be likely.</p><p>The push for tax reform is on back in the U.S., President Trump set to head  to Capitol Hill today again to something of a pep talk to encourage  republican senators to move forward on tax reform.</p><p>First daughter, Ivanka Trump spoke about the importance of getting that  reform passed, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, FIRST DAUGHTER:  The tax reform is so critical.  We're doing  it administratively deregulation.  Really fueling entrepreneurship in this  country and you see it in terms of optimism, you see it in terms of the  stock market.  </p><p>I would hear it in every conversation I had with the people through the  course of the day and in the room.  So that's what fuels us and that's what  we're fighting for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>The very latest as the House prepares to vote on that budget later this  week which will move the process forward.  </p><p>Uranium One, well the deal in question.  The House is investigating reports  this morning that an FBI informant was blocked by Obama Era Attorney  General Loretta Lynch from testifying on information that Russian nuclear  officials were involved in fraudulent dealings back in 2009.  Why he was  reportedly threatened with criminal action, we are on it this morning.</p><p>And then the quest for Amazon, the technology giant has already received  238 bids from cities hoping, looking to host the company's second U.S.  headquarters.  The details on who has the inside track coming up.  </p><p>But first, I'm coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.   We are at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this morning,  2,500 delegates are here all looking to get a piece of this action.  </p><p>There is something of a revolution going on in Saudi Arabia right now.   They are starting from scratch hoping to build industries from tourism to  medical devices, to all sorts of things that people want.  </p><p>Basically every weekend lot of Saudis leave this area and go elsewhere to  have some entertainment.  They go to Dubai, they go to Qatar, other places  other than Saudi Arabia.  Now, the leadership here is saying, \"We want our  people to spend their money here and we want foreign investments already.\"  </p><p>So you're looking at an environment right now where you've got the titans  of business here on the ground in Riyadh hoping to get a piece of this  buildup.  Buildup in infrastructure, buildup in medical technologies,  buildup in tourism.</p><p>The area is absolutely beautiful, they are creating a new city which is  going to be on the border of Egypt and Jordan right on the water and  they're hoping to put hotels, really a change in terms of culture and a  change in terms of perception.</p><p>That's why we're here today, we're getting an inside look at what's  happening, and certainly all of the names that we will be speaking with  today are going to tell us what specifically to expect as this country goes  through dramatic change in the next five years.</p><p>We'll tell you all about it in the program this morning.  Coming up, I'll  be talking with the chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, the  public investment fund, his royal highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman al- Saud.</p><p>I will speak with the crown prince, I've spent some time with him yesterday  as he explained what is taking place.  His royal highness has a vision, of  course, blessed by the king of Saudi Arabia and they are putting that  vision to work.  That is why it has attracted so many dignitaries and  delegates from around the world here this week.</p><p>I'm also speaking with Former Chairman and CEO of Arconic, Klaus Kleinfeld,  he is going to be joining me on stage along with the Chairman and CEO of  Softbank, Masayoshi Son, he is going to, of course, talk about he's  allocating capital.  He's got that $100 billion vision fund, everybody  wants to get some investment from that vision fund.</p><p>He's going to talk to us about why it is so important to invest here.  The  Saudis gave him $45 billion as part of that $100 billion vision fund.  </p><p>Also here the Blackstone Chairman and CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, he's going  to join me coming up as well.  He's on stage with me coming up along with  Boston Dynamic CEO, Marc Raibert.  </p><p>Raibert is basically talking about robotics, they're going to get robotics,  drone, the whole host of new innovative technologies working on the ground  here in Saudi.  So we're going to hear about all the investment  opportunities from this group coming up when I sit down with them on stage  momentarily.</p><p>We will bring you that conference live as it happens.  </p><p>First though, joining me from New York this morning, Fox Business Network's  Dagen McDowell.  Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.  And  TheBlaze TV Host, Lawrence Jones.  Great to see everybody.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, THEBLAZE TV HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You look fantastic as always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, incredible.  I mean markets, here we are in Saudi  Arabia, you can't believe the number of people here trying to get a piece  of the action basically because they're starting from scratch.</p><p>This is a completely changed idea in terms of what Saudi has been, a close  society, they're trying to hard to open it.  Question is, are they moving  too fast?  Will it be able to change the perception and get foreign money  coming into the country?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's a front page article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" about that very thing today Maria.  It's so amazing that you're  there that this is such a huge shift in terms of moving from investment  fund if you will that invested in the Saudi Arabia and economy.</p><p>Investing in only domestic interest say banks, even a fish farm at one  point but now trying to shift from being solely dependent on oil to  technology investment.  And the \"Journal\" points out that $3.5 billion  investment in Uber sometime last year that didn't go that well with the  ouster of the CEO of that company recently.</p><p>But I think that the amount of money at stake and the number of attendees  at this conference, it's proof of how much money Saudi Arabia is going to  be investing for decades to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And you know, the Saudis gave  Softbank $45 billion Kevin Kelly of that $100 billion vision fund.  Don't  forget, Alibaba was a big portion of the performance of that fund.</p><p>So are there other Alibaba's out there Kevin in terms of really hitting it  big to keep up that incredible performance of the vision fund?</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  What I think is pretty interesting and  unique is that most sovereign wealth funds or public investment funds they  actually go very safe and conservative route.</p><p>They have a lot of stocks, a lot of stocks, a lot of bonds, if you look at  another one that's Norway, they are very conservative.  They have almost $1  trillion.  And so this shows you the different tech that you need to do in  today's environment.</p><p>And the Saudis are leading that, right?  They're getting into venture  capital, they're getting on the edge of technology which is so important  today because we have such a dynamic shift that's happening in the  marketplace.</p><p>And I think it's important to note that this is a smart move.  Back in 2015  they realized they needed to cut their dependency on oil.  And so for 40  years they were solely focused on it.  So it 2015 they got aggressive and  they got smart and the decided to diversify.</p><p>And that's what they need to do.  So we'll have to see, there is another  Alibaba out there, can they do it with Softbank?  You know what, if history  is any guide, they're going to have a good chance.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well can we talk about tech for a second guys?  I mean  what's going on with this rollover?  We saw the worst week since around the  election for stocks like Google, Alphabet, as parents of Google, Amazon.</p><p>Going into these earnings, Amazon and Alphabet earnings, these stocks are  really rolling over.  What's going on with the broader market trading up  and technology trading down?</p><p>KELLY:  I think you're seeing a sector rotation and it's natural.  I mean  the market is up pretty significantly for the year and technology has led  that.  So people are getting into other areas of the market.</p><p>Financials actually took that leadership after they had a great earning  season but it's also important to note that there's a lot of regulatory  risk on the horizons for these technology companies.</p><p>When you started to see at Facebook, a lot of the Russian ads came in due  effect, there's talk about Amazon and whether they need to be broken up.  I  mean we didn't hear that before and that actually weighed on big tech  titans like IBM in the '60s as well as Microsoft back in the late '90s.</p><p>So this is pretty telling.  The regulatory effects is actually what's  worrying investors right now for putting new capital to work.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria, real quick in terms of earnings one thing to watch which  dovetails with where you are and the upcoming Aramco IPO that the energy  sector for the third quarter is trending up the most in terms of earnings  growth.</p><p>Earnings are expected to be up 136 percent from one year ago.  This is the  energy sector in the United States, that's up from 129 percent growth just  one month ago.  So a big rebound for energy earnings and expectations are  going up as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Wow.  One of the biggest headlines to come  out of this conference so far was that Saudi ARamco IPO was actually on  track.</p><p>So the public investment funds managing director, the oil giant's public  debut he said is still on schedule for the second half of the year, this  sovereign wealth fund is going to become one of the world's largest  investors.</p><p>And you said the \"Journal\" story today points out that the fund already had  some trouble in terms of lack (INAUDIBLE) or performances like Uber.  So  you've got Uber there, you've got this fund looking for the big highlights  in terms of where the growth comes from next.</p><p>They are all setting their sites on innovation, technology, things like  drones.  Lawrence Jones, what's on your radar this morning?</p><p>JONES:  When I look at what's on my radar, it's this stuff with Russia  considering that the Clintons had something going on that the Congress did  not know about that the FBI knew about it and now they're trying to conduct  and investigation.</p><p>But we did not know.  So that's problematic for me.  I'm interested to see  what's going to come out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're going to have more on that coming up on the program.   As you know, I interviewed John Podesta about this very subject a long time  ago.  And so we pointed out that there's something about Russia and the  democrats to talk about.</p><p>Not necessarily this administration and the Russians but we're  investigating both sides of it, so we'll come up -- come back with more on  that coming up.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a lot of earnings on the table, that's going to set the tone for  markets today as soon.  As soon as those numbers come out, we're going to  bring them to you and, of course, there's all this anticipation about the  tech earnings after the bell.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Uranium One deal in question,  the House investigating reports that an FBI informant was blocked from  testifying on information that Russian nuclear officials were involved in  fraudulent deals back in 2009 under Hillary Clinton's watch as she was  Secretary of the State.</p><p>And then let the games begin, from Coast-to-Coast, from cities big and  small, find out just how many cities are battling and trying to get  Amazon's attention for Amazon's new headquarters.</p><p>All that coming right here live from Riyadh and New York this Tuesday  morning.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>President Trump is set to announce today a title cap on the number of  refugees entering the United States.  Cheryl Casone on headlines right now  with details.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And good morning Maria.  So under these  new rules the U.S. would limit refugee admissions to 45,000 down from  110,000.</p><p>The president also expected to call for tougher vetting rules.  This comes  as the Trump Administration's 120 day refugee ban actually expires today.</p><p>Programming note for all of you, President Trump is going to be \"Lou Dobbs  Tonight\" for an exclusive interview.  That is tomorrow, 7:00p.m. Eastern  Time right here on the  FOX Business Network, don't miss that interview.</p><p>Well, Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is in Pakistan today.  He told  reporters he's going to pressure Pakistani leaders to stop the support of  the Taliban and other terrorist groups that they receive in that country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have made some very specific request  at Pakistan, this is the conditions-based approach.  And so our  relationship with Pakistan will also be conditions-based.</p><p>It will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary.   The Pakistan needs I think take a clear eye view of the situation that  they're confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations  that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  We should add that Pakistan still denies providing a safe haven  for terrorists.  </p><p>Well, Amazon says 238 cities and regions have submitted bids for its second  headquarters.  The cities include New York, Boston, Atlanta, Nashville,  Tennessee, even Austin, Texas.  And get this, Puerto Rico.  Amazon says  it's going to make a decision on the location at some point next year.  </p><p>Now technology stocks have been sinking ahead of Amazon's earnings.  Those  earnings due out Thursday after the bell.  Of course, we're going to have  them for you on FOX Business.  </p><p>And Delta Airlines is putting up the help wanted sign.  The carrier looking  to hire about a thousand flight attendants for next year and there is no  shortage of applicants, 125,000 applications have been received so far.   Delta shares about eight percent for 2017.</p><p>Also Delta is ditching Microsoft in favor of Apple.  A technology website  is reporting that Delta's only 30,000 crew members are going to get iPad  and iPhones reversing a deal with Microsoft that the carrier had announced  just four years ago.</p><p>iPads in the cockpit, I don't know Maria.  And those are your headlines  from New York.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  We are looking at this  market, really continue the momentum.  Dagen, Lawrence, Kevin, what is it  going to do at this point given that we still haven't seen the policy but  it feels like the president is trying to move up the tax reform deadline.   How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that this market does hinge on what comes out of  Washington at this point because of the continued run with stocks closing  at all time highs on Friday but DOW, Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P500.</p><p>I think that one thing that people aren't factoring in, the possibility of  the new Federal Reserve chief that because, again, as you have a Fed that  is tightening monetary policy with higher rates but also I'm trying to  unwind or begin to unwind that is $4.5 trillion balanced sheet.</p><p>They hear a lot of unknowns in there that people are not really facing at  this point and then you have like foul ups like that 401K contribution  limit that the GOP was talking about dramatically cutting and then  President Trump had to come out and say, \"No\" and put the icksnay on that.   So I think that there's a lot of room for error.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what, you make a real -- incredible points that  you're making.  In terms of the Fed chairman, when I spoke with the  president at the end of last week, he basically narrowed it down, right?</p><p>He narrowed it down to two players as well as Janet Yellen.  He talked  about Jay Powell and he talked about John Taylor.  It looks like those are  the two favorite picks.</p><p>KELLY:  Maria, and I think one thing that came really across well in that  interview is that that was very presidential of Donald Trump to give kudos  to Janet Yellen and say that he likes her.</p><p>I mean she is the sitting Fed chairman and that's very important because  you want a nice continuity.  So should he not pick her, at least it was a  great signal to the market and I think that's why you saw the market not  selloff.</p><p>But when we were talking about the markets, I mean I don't think tax reform  is as important.  And one of the reasons why we're seeing in the earnings  cycle, people are talking about how global growth is doing.</p><p>Well look at the price of copper, it's over $7,000 a ton.  It's almost near  its 20 -- late 2013 peak of $7,430.  That's showing the global growth is  strong and these companies are benefiting from it.  Should we get tax  reform?  It's icing on the cake.</p><p>JONES:  But Maria, I do think that people are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think this is a great point.  Yes.</p><p>JONES:  Yes.  Maria, I think people in the markets are optimistic about tax  reform but I think all eyes are on the city.  Remember, 200 bills passed  about the House that have died of (INAUDIBLE) in the Senate.</p><p>So a lot of people are worrying when it comes to the Senate.  But Americans  in the markets are optimistic that we could get something done.  I mean  this is something that democrats and republicans should be able to agree on  and it only strengthens the market when they see Washington working  together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so.  And he made the point of saying Rand  Paul will vote yes for tax reform.  He's focused on the Senate for sure.  </p><p>All right.  We are live form Riyadh this morning.  Let me take a short  break and come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's Tuesday morning everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We are looking at markets which are trading higher this morning.  Plus, new  allegations this morning of collusion between Russia and the Clintons.  The  House Oversight Committee is now investigating an Obama Era deal in which a  Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the United  States.</p><p>The former FBI informant who could offer more details about the deal, well  he's under a gag order apparently that prevents him from testifying before  the Congress.  The informant's lawyer question the legality of the order on  \"Lou Dobb's\" program last night, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, LAWYER:  If it does and it is unconstitutional and it's  invalid if it prohibits my client from giving information to the  legislature.  The executive cannot say to people, \"Hey, you can't give  information to another body of the government.\"</p><p>So you can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time  that all this bribery payments were made.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there's House Oversight Committee Member,  Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, he appeared on FOX News over the weekend,  he calls for the Justice Department to remove the nondisclosure agreement  which prevents the former informant from testifying about the bribery  scheme before Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBER:  This informant  wants to tell his story but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement  that was signed with the (INAUDIBLE) Justice Department.</p><p>He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta  Lynch Justice Department.  Clearly it's in the interest, in the public's  interest that this individual be able to tell the story to congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, during my exclusive interview at the end of last  week with President Trump, he told me that Special Counsel Robert Mueller  should stop probing the Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The uranium situation with  Russia getting uranium, they better look into that.  That is looking like a  very serious situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is he going to look into it?</p><p>TRUMP:   I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  That's up to them but I can  tell you Senator Grassley wants to look into it and others do but that's to  me a very, very serious charge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Lawrence Jones, let's talk about this for a second because  for years before the Clinton State Department, for years the Russians  wanted to buy uranium.  Let's just call this what it is.  Uranium is used  to make a nuclear bomb.</p><p>JONES:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they wanted to buy uranium.  They wanted to buy uranium and  president after president said, \"No, no, no, no, no, no we're not going to  sell our uranium.\"</p><p>All of a sudden under Hillary Clinton State Department, she --</p><p>JONES:  A deal was cut.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- approves 20 percent of the U.S.'s stock pile of uranium and  then she gets $140 million sent to her Clinton Foundation?</p><p>JONES:  A lot of shady business.  Now, we don't know if there was evidence  of wrong doing but there's a lot of smoke there that should have been  investigated.  </p><p>And I think it's particularly concerning Maria that Congress didn't know  anything about this but a lot of people within the department for eight  years knew this was going on and didn't report.  We've had leaks on  everything else and here was no leaks on this particular problem.</p><p>What we didn't know after looking into this when it come -- concerning this  whole uranium thing is that Obama knew as well.  He knew this and still  didn't tell Congress ,didn't notify the proper channels in this until I  think that's problematic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well it looks like a quid quo pro going on and she's  getting all that money.  She sells the uranium.  And by the way, we should  point out that the company that bought the uranium is Kremlin backed.  I  mean this was a government backed company that wanted the uranium.  </p><p>JONES:  That's correct.  And we also know now Maria because of more  investigation that the Russians were also trying to influence Hillary  Clinton as well.  That's more developments that we got out of this  particular story particularly from the Hill.</p><p>So now we know that it wasn't just Donald Trump that all these players were  trying to influence, it was everyone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we also should point out that around that same time Bill  Clinton, Former President Clinton was getting paid, what, $500,000 for a  speech in Moscow?  </p><p>JONES:  Which they did not disclose.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was getting other money.  Yes.</p><p>JONES:  Exactly.  Which they did not dis --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Separating apart from the $140 million.</p><p>JONES:  Correct Maria.  And remember, they had an agreement when this first  started that they were supposed to notify the Obama Administration to  prevent this type of wrong doing from happening.  And it looks like they  knew and didn't say anything. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All of this exchange of money and yet we're still talking  about potential collusion with the Trump Administration, incredible.</p><p>All right.  We will keep following that for you.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, is it a Snap flop?  Snap's vision for  spectacles not so clear.  We will tell you about that.</p><p>And then the fall classic may have to get a new name this year.  Why the  world series maybe hotter than ever but not for the reason that you think.   We're on it, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, everybody!  Thanks so much for joining  us.  Welcome back!  We are live this morning, it is Tuesday, October 24th,  we're coming to you from Riyadh.  Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on  the East Coast.  And earnings (INAUDIBLE) and starts on Wall Street this  morning.  </p><p>We've got General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, United Technology, just  a few of the names due out before the opening bell -- that is what's going  to set the tone for markets today.  We'll have the numbers as soon as they  hit the tape.  Eli Lili just reported minutes ago; the company beat  expectation on both earnings and revenue.  Take a look at the shares, Eli  Lili now at 87 and change.  </p><p>Earnings expected to drive markets today.  Futures are pointing higher  today, got a pretty good, firmer tone this morning on Wall Street.  Take a  look, we're at the highs of the morning right here; Dow Industrials set to  open about 55 points -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  NASDAQ,  S&amp;P500 also higher this morning, as you see there.  </p><p>In Europe, stocks are searching for direction.  In fact, the FTSE100 is not  so far away from breaking even right now.  Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE up five points; the CAC Quarante is up a third of a percent,  16 points higher; and Dax Index in Germany, up 24 right now.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly higher, as you will here.  Best performer  overnight was the Nikkei Average, up half-of-a-percent in Japan.  Some real  momentum going on in Japan, recently.  Shanghai Composite up a quarter-of- a-percent as well.</p><p>Tackling tax reform; that is the focus in the U.S.  President Trump is  taking his tax cut quest to Capitol Hill today, with something of a pep  talk to Republican Senators.  He talked about the chances of getting  through during my one-on-one exclusive interview just this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we have the votes.   We have tremendous enthusiasm this time.  Healthcare, I was told it was  tougher, but it was close.  I mean, so far, I would say it's not even a  contest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to break down the timeline for tax reform; it  could happen sooner than you think.  We'll tell you what we know now.  </p><p>Plus, reducing the reach: Facebook is testing a new feature that would  split its news feed varying publishers that don't pay up.  The social media  giant's response to the controversy this morning, coming up.  </p><p>And not sorry, Ms. Jackson; why the NFL is denying that the lead band,  Janet Jackson, amid backlash over Justin Timberlake upcoming Super Bowl  half-time show.  Remember the wardrobe malfunction a couple years ago?  All  right.  We'll get into it.  </p><p>Plus, the World Series; the hottest men ticking in town, literally.   Tonight's game, one could be the hottest start to the fall classic you've  ever seen.  We will have a preview of Astros-Dodgers showdown in Los  Angeles, coming up this morning.  </p><p>But, first, I am coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Among the big names I'll be speaking  with, coming up this morning: The Chairman of the Country's Sovereign  Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, his royal highness,  Prince Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, is with me.  I met with his royal  highness yesterday and he explained to me what the goal is, how they are  trying to get new money into the country and create some of a tourist spot  in Saudi Arabia.  We're going to tell you all about it.  </p><p>But, first, our top stories right now this half an hour: tax reform on  Capitol Hill, President Trump is set to meet with Republican Senators at  the weekly public lunch today -- that is the policy lunch.  At the top of  the agenda, a tax overhaul.  This, as Ivanka Trump touted the  administration's tax plan during a town hall event last night in  Pennsylvania, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  This tax reform really  couples two things that are really core values as a country which is work  and supporting the American family.  There are many elements of this tax  plan that, I think, are squarely targeted at creating jobs in this country,  creating growth in this country, and offering relief to our middle-income  families. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk about that and the impact on  business, the engineering and infrastructure company AECOM CEO Michael  Burke.  Michael, it's good to have you on the program today.  </p><p>MICHAEL BURKE, CEO, AECOM:  Great!  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So, I want to ask you, really,  why you would come to an investment conference like this.  I know that  infrastructure is very important all around the world, first, though, you  think the big opportunity for infrastructure is in the United States?  </p><p>BURKE:  Sure, the infrastructure opportunity right now is clearly in the  United States.  And there are many countries around the world, sovereign  wealth funds like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia here today that's looking to  invest their capital in infrastructure in the United States.  But  additionally, we are working on infrastructure projects here in the country  like the Riyadh Metro System right here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now you are -- I want to ask you about that because this  is, like, a whole new cultural change that's going on here.  But, first, in  terms of the U.S., and the tax plan, and infrastructure plan, do you expect  -- when I asked the president about this, this week, he said, yes, I'm  going to do an infrastructure plan in 2018, you wanted to see it sooner  rather than later, obviously?  </p><p>BURKE:  Certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you think it's coming?</p><p>BURKE:  It's definitely coming.  I was hoping for it to come much sooner.   I really thought it was going to be the top priority of the administration.   We have broad bipartisan support in Washington on both sides of the aisle  on Capitol Hill, and we have administrative support.  And so, we had really  a strong, strong support, and I thought it would've been top of the agenda,  but that's not the course that it took.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you see the opportunity in the U.S. in terms of  infrastructure, what do you want to see done?  I mean, are you talking  about roads, bridges, what's the big -- big idea?  </p><p>BURKE:  Yes, transportation is probably the single area that requires the  most focus, to reduce the friction on the economy but we also have an  outdated water infrastructure system across the country, we have rural  broadband that is way behind the urban environment that needs  infrastructure support.  And I really think the big idea is incenting the  private sector to bring these large pools of capital.  You hear it here  today in Riyadh; there's $22 trillion of assets represented by the people  persuaded in this conference that want to invest in infrastructure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, infrastructure, obviously, important for this  administration; what about tax reform?  How big of an impact is that going  to have on business and on economic growth?  </p><p>BURKE:  Tax reform is critical.  As you know, we have the highest corporate  tax rate among all the OECD countries, so it's critical to make sure that  the U.S. is competitive from a business attractiveness perspective.  And  ultimately, GDP growth will contribute to infrastructure growth.  So, we  have to get the economy growing, we need to have a competitive tax rate,  and that will produce jobs, produce GDP that will then fund infrastructure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that they're going to get caught up in the debates  or the pushback, like for example on the state and local tax deduction?  A  lot of people are saying, look, I'm not going to vote, yes, for that, that  means a tax increase for some of our constituents.  So, is that going to  hold up tax reform?  </p><p>BURKE:  It's one of the many challenges of tax reform.  And I think right  now, we do have both sides of the aisle that are interested in the lower  corporate rate, but we need to pay for us.  And the state tax deduction is  one of those items that are on the table, and somebody's going to have to  compromise significantly to get this across the finish line, and I expect  they'll get it done by December.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Take me to Saudi Arabia, then, tell me what you're  doing here, what you want to do here?  This is some grand ambitions to turn  Saudi Arabia into a tourist spot, open it up to foreign investment, fix in  infrastructure or create to infrastructure that doesn't exist right now in  some cities, is it doable, can they pull this off?  </p><p>BURKE:  You know, I think they can.  You know, it's an exciting time here.   They've set forth the long-term 2030 vision, and that's the start of the  plan.  And they are really focused on diversifying away from oil and they  have the right vision, and we're seeing some great ideas and we're working  on some great ideas for the country to develop new cities.  And they have  to have not only a vision, but a real differentiator, and so we're looking  at cities that will bring in robotics, and bring in a whole new host of  technologies that will differentiate them.  We're looking at new cities  that will bring entertainment into Riyadh which has long been avoided.  And  so, it's an exciting time here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  I remember saying earlier that a lot of people,  they leave every Friday, they want entertainment, and they go find it; they  find it in Dubai and elsewhere.  And now, the Saudi leadership is saying,  why are we doing this, why are we allowing all of our money to leave?  </p><p>BURKE:  We're seeing it up on the Red Sea.  And the Red Sea has beautiful,  beautiful beach fronts.  And I think these developments will be our aim to  keeping Saudis in the country when they want to take holiday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's an important plan and certainly ambitious.  Michael,  we'll be watching.  Great to have you on the program today.  </p><p>BURKE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Michael Burke, joining us there.  We'll take  a break.  When we come back, remember Janet Jackson?  There's a new Super  Bowl controversy right now.  The NFL is issuing a new statement about the  superstar, 14 years after that wardrobe malfunction with Justin Timberlake,  find out why.  And then, hungry for good news?  Well, we're keeping an eye  on Chipotle as the company reports earnings after the bell tonight.  We'll  tell you what people are expecting after a tough period for that stock,  back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for being with us  this morning.  Happy Tuesday!  We are coming to you live today from Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia.  Market is looking higher; we're at the highs of the morning  right now.  Dow Industrials set to open up 60 points; earnings in focus,  obviously.  </p><p>A couple of names we're watching related earnings.  We are watching the  companies set to report before the open today, 3M, and also looking  earnings of 2.21 a share, that, of course, the third-quarter.  Shares of 3M  are up nearly 25 percent this year.  </p><p>Also watching shares of Chipotle; the company set to report its third- quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  It's had a rough year.  Analysts  are looking for earnings of $1.63 a share.  The stock down better than 20  percent over the last year.  </p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, downplaying a test on its news feed.  You have to hear  this one, Cheryl Casone with the details in now New York, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's interesting, Maria, that Facebook test removed page post from  the news feed to a separate feed called explore.  But it's harder to find,  and the move cost a big drop in traffic in six different countries,  including Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia.  Facebook said it doesn't plan to  expand this test any further for now.  So, the test is over.  Meanwhile,  the company is said it's also experimenting with splitting its news feed in  two -- separating commercial posts from the personal news.  And its bid to  boost advertising from business -- there's the stock in the premarket up  slightly.  </p><p>Snapchat parent company, Snap, reportedly is stuck with hundreds of  thousands of unsold spectacles, that's because demand for those spectacles  quickly fell after last year's holiday shopping season.  Snap also let off  about a dozen employees that supported that division that was making the  spectacle, that happened just last month.  Taking a look at the stock,  Snap's down about 40 percent so far since the IPO, 40 percent.  </p><p>All right, now that Justin Timberlake is performing at Super Bowl, everyone  is wondering if Janet Jackson has been banned for making a guest  appearance.  You know, it's been almost 14 years since that infamous  wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl.  Well, speculation was rising  that the NFL had banned her.  The NFL is saying, though, in a statement,  nonsense, \"There's no ban.  We are not going to comment on any speculation  regarding potential guests.  There may be no guests.  Along with Pepsi,  we're excited to have Justin Timberlake.\"  Super Bowl 52, set for February  4th, guys, in Minneapolis.  </p><p>And baseball is hot right now, literally.  Los Angeles is in the grips of a  heat wave just as world series is getting underway tonight in Los Angeles.   Forecasters calling for temperatures to be near 100-degrees at game time.   The World Series record, we should add, for the hottest first-pitch  temperature was 94-degrees.  That was set in Phoenix, Arizona during game  one back in 2001, so we shall see.  First pitch tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern  Time.  And, of course, Maria, the game is going to be on Fox, back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool, all right, Cheryl, thank you.  We'll take a break when we  come back, companies such as Memphis Meats, they want to revolutionize the  way we eat.  The Venture Capital Company, 50 years, wants to revolutionize  the way we invest as well over the next 50.  Millennials and social  investing, that's next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Live from the Future Investment Initiative here  in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning, we're talking about investing  globally, doing good in the world, making money in the process, that is the  idea behind venture capital firm, 50 Years, which is backing companies that  will have global impact for the next 50 years and beyond.  Joining us right  now for the first time in Fox Business Interview is 50 Years' Founding  Partner, Seth Bannon.  And Seth, it's good to have you on the program.   Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>SETH BANNON, FOUNDING PARTNER, 50 YEARS:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were talking during the commercial break about how  millennials don't necessarily care about making money only, they want a  purpose, they want to make sure they're doing the right thing.  Most people  want to make wealth, and then commit to solving the world's problems, why  do you think you could do this both?  </p><p>BANNON:  Well, millennials certainly think: you can.  So, if you ask any  other generation: what is the purpose of business, the vast majority of  them would say, some version of to make money -- of course, that's what a  job is for.  But if you ask millennials this, and (INAUDIBLE) actually did  a study of 7,700 millennials across 29 countries, and they asked them the  open-ended question: what is the purpose of business?  </p><p>In a plurality, 47 percent said some version of to improve society or  protect the environment.  Now, millennials also think that they should make  money, but they want to have it all in careers.  And so, our fund actually  believes that companies, if they want to recruit and retain the top talent  of tomorrow, we're going to have to offer millennials what they want, which  is to combine their values with their careers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?  What should we be aware of in terms of doing  just that?  </p><p>BANNON:  So, I mean, there's a plethora of problems in the world.  And  hence, a plethora of ways that you can both make money and do good.  So, I  think we're facing an incredible climate crisis, we're facing health  problems throughout the world, we're failing to feed the world, all of  these represent massive, massive industries where you can build business  that both make billions of dollars a year, and also do a lot of good in the  process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's doing it well?  </p><p>BANNON:  Well, I always turn to our own portfolio.  One of the companies  that have been in the news recently called Memphis Meats, so they  essentially produce meats without the animal.  And so, you know, it's crazy  that in 2017 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain how you do that: produce meat without the animal, I  don't get it.  </p><p>BANNON:  Yes, so they essentially farm cells directly.  So, you can sort of  think about it this way: so, a cow is essentially being used as a piece of  technology to take plant protein inputs and then convert them into outputs  that we like to eat, drink, or wear -- in this case, meat.  And inside the  cows, there are certain biological processes happening that are causing  that transition.  And so, the idea of Memphis Meats is what if we took the  same biological processes, we'll just bring them outside of the cow so that  we can the same delicious we want just without the animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that Richard Branson and Bill Gates  have invested in this company, right?  </p><p>BANNON:  They did.  And even more interestingly, we think, is Cardio  invested in -- it's one of the largest players in conventional meat  actually investing in our last round.  And the CEO Cargo was on this  network, recently, and talked about clean meat as an inevitability, as  something that's going to happen -- it'll happen in the next couple of  years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I was laughing when I was looking at some of the research  -- well, not laughing, but you're a part of the vegan mafia in Silicon  Valley, is that true?  Is that what they call it?  </p><p>BANNON:  Yes, exactly, yes.  So, the food system is broken from top to  bottom.  And one of the largest problems is actually animal agriculture  itself.  So, many people don't know this but animal agriculture contributes  more to greenhouse gas emissions than all planes, trains, trucks, boats,  and motorcycles combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I didn't know that.</p><p>BANNON:  That's worse than all the transportation.  And it's failing to see  the world.  And factory farming has reached limits of scale, but it's still  not getting people in.  So, the vegan mafia believes that there are some  interesting solutions in either plant-based alternatives or clean meat or  what we call cellular agriculture to actually help solve these problems.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the next big wave of technology companies that you see  taking form in Silicon Valley right now?  Is this part of it, do they have  the vision to combine profit and social impact, tell us who is hot right  now, and where the next wave of growth is?  </p><p>BANNON:  We're very bullish on computational synthetic biology, we're very  bullish on space tech, we're bullish on medical devices.  Obviously,  machine learning is showing its face in every industry.  But I would say,  the single industry is we're most excited about called Cellular  Agriculture, and it's along the same lines.  It's essentially a new crop of  companies that are making the products that we all love from animals just  without the animals.  </p><p>So, we had personally invested in a company doing it for meat, the company  doing it for leather, company doing it for gelatin, company doing it for  milk proteins.  There are other companies doing it for eggs, for fish, even  for spider silk.  We think it's going to be one of the most impactful and  then profitable technology revolution that the world has ever seen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff.  Seth, thank so much for sharing.  </p><p>BANNON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much, Seth Bannon, joining  us there.  Coming up, I will have much more live from the Future Investment  Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  I'll be talking with the Chairman  of the country's Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, his  Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, will join me  on stage along with Steve Schwartzman, and Masayoshi Son from Softbank, we  will talk about the new ambitious plans coming out of Saudi Arabia coming  up next, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, welcome back!  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, October 24th.   Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings split on  Wall Street.

It is Tuesday,  October 24th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings splits on Wall Street, among the big names set to report earnings  this morning, General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, and United  Technologies.  We are bringing you all of the numbers as soon as they hit  the tape and we will have the analysis as they come in.  What do the  numbers mean to you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Futures meanwhile showing the markets are looking higher this morning, take  a look at what we've got, this momentum lives on.  DOW Industrial set to  open up about 45 points today, Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 also in positive territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe, a bit of a different story, stocks are searching for some  direction this morning.  Take a look at the euro zone where the FTSE100 is  up just a fraction and the CAC Krones and the DAX Index are up just about a  quarter of a percent or so.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you'll see taking at cue  once again.  From the U.S., the Shanghai Composite, the Nikkei Average and  the Kospi all fractionally better on the session.  The Hang Seng lower by  half a percent.  </p><p> Well the Saudi Aramco IPO is on track apparently, the public investment  fund managing director giving some hopes to big investors saying that the  oil giant's public debut is still on schedule for next year despite the  speculation that we are going to see some private investors getting on this  deal like the Chinese which may very well still be likely.</p><p> The push for tax reform is on back in the U.S., President Trump set to head  to Capitol Hill today again to something of a pep talk to encourage  republican senators to move forward on tax reform.</p><p> First daughter, Ivanka Trump spoke about the importance of getting that  reform passed, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IVANKA TRUMP, FIRST DAUGHTER:  The tax reform is so critical.  We're doing  it administratively deregulation.  Really fueling entrepreneurship in this  country and you see it in terms of optimism, you see it in terms of the  stock market.  </p><p> I would hear it in every conversation I had with the people through the  course of the day and in the room.  So that's what fuels us and that's what  we're fighting for.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> The very latest as the House prepares to vote on that budget later this  week which will move the process forward.  </p><p> Uranium One, well the deal in question.  The House is investigating reports  this morning that an FBI informant was blocked by Obama Era Attorney  General Loretta Lynch from testifying on information that Russian nuclear  officials were involved in fraudulent dealings back in 2009.  Why he was  reportedly threatened with criminal action, we are on it this morning.</p><p> And then the quest for Amazon, the technology giant has already received  238 bids from cities hoping, looking to host the company's second U.S.  headquarters.  The details on who has the inside track coming up.  </p><p> But first, I'm coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.   We are at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this morning,  2,500 delegates are here all looking to get a piece of this action.  </p><p> There is something of a revolution going on in Saudi Arabia right now.   They are starting from scratch hoping to build industries from tourism to  medical devices, to all sorts of things that people want.  </p><p> Basically every weekend lot of Saudis leave this area and go elsewhere to  have some entertainment.  They go to Dubai, they go to Qatar, other places  other than Saudi Arabia.  Now, the leadership here is saying, \"We want our  people to spend their money here and we want foreign investments already.\"  </p><p> So you're looking at an environment right now where you've got the titans  of business here on the ground in Riyadh hoping to get a piece of this  buildup.  Buildup in infrastructure, buildup in medical technologies,  buildup in tourism.</p><p> The area is absolutely beautiful, they are creating a new city which is  going to be on the border of Egypt and Jordan right on the water and  they're hoping to put hotels, really a change in terms of culture and a  change in terms of perception.</p><p> That's why we're here today, we're getting an inside look at what's  happening, and certainly all of the names that we will be speaking with  today are going to tell us what specifically to expect as this country goes  through dramatic change in the next five years.</p><p> We'll tell you all about it in the program this morning.  Coming up, I'll  be talking with the chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, the  public investment fund, his royal highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman al- Saud.</p><p> I will speak with the crown prince, I've spent some time with him yesterday  as he explained what is taking place.  His royal highness has a vision, of  course, blessed by the king of Saudi Arabia and they are putting that  vision to work.  That is why it has attracted so many dignitaries and  delegates from around the world here this week.</p><p> I'm also speaking with Former Chairman and CEO of Arconic, Klaus Kleinfeld,  he is going to be joining me on stage along with the Chairman and CEO of  Softbank, Masayoshi Son, he is going to, of course, talk about he's  allocating capital.  He's got that $100 billion vision fund, everybody  wants to get some investment from that vision fund.</p><p> He's going to talk to us about why it is so important to invest here.  The  Saudis gave him $45 billion as part of that $100 billion vision fund.  </p><p> Also here the Blackstone Chairman and CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, he's going  to join me coming up as well.  He's on stage with me coming up along with  Boston Dynamic CEO, Marc Raibert.  </p><p> Raibert is basically talking about robotics, they're going to get robotics,  drone, the whole host of new innovative technologies working on the ground  here in Saudi.  So we're going to hear about all the investment  opportunities from this group coming up when I sit down with them on stage  momentarily.</p><p> We will bring you that conference live as it happens.  </p><p> First though, joining me from New York this morning, Fox Business Network's  Dagen McDowell.  Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.  And  TheBlaze TV Host, Lawrence Jones.  Great to see everybody.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you Maria.</p><p> LAWRENCE JONES, THEBLAZE TV HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You look fantastic as always.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, incredible.  I mean markets, here we are in Saudi  Arabia, you can't believe the number of people here trying to get a piece  of the action basically because they're starting from scratch.</p><p> This is a completely changed idea in terms of what Saudi has been, a close  society, they're trying to hard to open it.  Question is, are they moving  too fast?  Will it be able to change the perception and get foreign money  coming into the country?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's a front page article in \"The Wall Street  Journal\" about that very thing today Maria.  It's so amazing that you're  there that this is such a huge shift in terms of moving from investment  fund if you will that invested in the Saudi Arabia and economy.</p><p> Investing in only domestic interest say banks, even a fish farm at one  point but now trying to shift from being solely dependent on oil to  technology investment.  And the \"Journal\" points out that $3.5 billion  investment in Uber sometime last year that didn't go that well with the  ouster of the CEO of that company recently.</p><p> But I think that the amount of money at stake and the number of attendees  at this conference, it's proof of how much money Saudi Arabia is going to  be investing for decades to come.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And you know, the Saudis gave  Softbank $45 billion Kevin Kelly of that $100 billion vision fund.  Don't  forget, Alibaba was a big portion of the performance of that fund.</p><p> So are there other Alibaba's out there Kevin in terms of really hitting it  big to keep up that incredible performance of the vision fund?</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  What I think is pretty interesting and  unique is that most sovereign wealth funds or public investment funds they  actually go very safe and conservative route.</p><p> They have a lot of stocks, a lot of stocks, a lot of bonds, if you look at  another one that's Norway, they are very conservative.  They have almost $1  trillion.  And so this shows you the different tech that you need to do in  today's environment.</p><p> And the Saudis are leading that, right?  They're getting into venture  capital, they're getting on the edge of technology which is so important  today because we have such a dynamic shift that's happening in the  marketplace.</p><p> And I think it's important to note that this is a smart move.  Back in 2015  they realized they needed to cut their dependency on oil.  And so for 40  years they were solely focused on it.  So it 2015 they got aggressive and  they got smart and the decided to diversify.</p><p> And that's what they need to do.  So we'll have to see, there is another  Alibaba out there, can they do it with Softbank?  You know what, if history  is any guide, they're going to have a good chance.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well can we talk about tech for a second guys?  I mean  what's going on with this rollover?  We saw the worst week since around the  election for stocks like Google, Alphabet, as parents of Google, Amazon.</p><p> Going into these earnings, Amazon and Alphabet earnings, these stocks are  really rolling over.  What's going on with the broader market trading up  and technology trading down?</p><p> KELLY:  I think you're seeing a sector rotation and it's natural.  I mean  the market is up pretty significantly for the year and technology has led  that.  So people are getting into other areas of the market.</p><p> Financials actually took that leadership after they had a great earning  season but it's also important to note that there's a lot of regulatory  risk on the horizons for these technology companies.</p><p> When you started to see at Facebook, a lot of the Russian ads came in due  effect, there's talk about Amazon and whether they need to be broken up.  I  mean we didn't hear that before and that actually weighed on big tech  titans like IBM in the '60s as well as Microsoft back in the late '90s.</p><p> So this is pretty telling.  The regulatory effects is actually what's  worrying investors right now for putting new capital to work.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maria, real quick in terms of earnings one thing to watch which  dovetails with where you are and the upcoming Aramco IPO that the energy  sector for the third quarter is trending up the most in terms of earnings  growth.</p><p> Earnings are expected to be up 136 percent from one year ago.  This is the  energy sector in the United States, that's up from 129 percent growth just  one month ago.  So a big rebound for energy earnings and expectations are  going up as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Wow.  One of the biggest headlines to come  out of this conference so far was that Saudi ARamco IPO was actually on  track.</p><p> So the public investment funds managing director, the oil giant's public  debut he said is still on schedule for the second half of the year, this  sovereign wealth fund is going to become one of the world's largest  investors.</p><p> And you said the \"Journal\" story today points out that the fund already had  some trouble in terms of lack (INAUDIBLE) or performances like Uber.  So  you've got Uber there, you've got this fund looking for the big highlights  in terms of where the growth comes from next.</p><p> They are all setting their sites on innovation, technology, things like  drones.  Lawrence Jones, what's on your radar this morning?</p><p> JONES:  When I look at what's on my radar, it's this stuff with Russia  considering that the Clintons had something going on that the Congress did  not know about that the FBI knew about it and now they're trying to conduct  and investigation.</p><p> But we did not know.  So that's problematic for me.  I'm interested to see  what's going to come out of it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're going to have more on that coming up on the program.   As you know, I interviewed John Podesta about this very subject a long time  ago.  And so we pointed out that there's something about Russia and the  democrats to talk about.</p><p> Not necessarily this administration and the Russians but we're  investigating both sides of it, so we'll come up -- come back with more on  that coming up.  </p><p> Meanwhile, a lot of earnings on the table, that's going to set the tone for  markets today as soon.  As soon as those numbers come out, we're going to  bring them to you and, of course, there's all this anticipation about the  tech earnings after the bell.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Uranium One deal in question,  the House investigating reports that an FBI informant was blocked from  testifying on information that Russian nuclear officials were involved in  fraudulent deals back in 2009 under Hillary Clinton's watch as she was  Secretary of the State.</p><p> And then let the games begin, from Coast-to-Coast, from cities big and  small, find out just how many cities are battling and trying to get  Amazon's attention for Amazon's new headquarters.</p><p> All that coming right here live from Riyadh and New York this Tuesday  morning.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p> President Trump is set to announce today a title cap on the number of  refugees entering the United States.  Cheryl Casone on headlines right now  with details.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And good morning Maria.  So under these  new rules the U.S. would limit refugee admissions to 45,000 down from  110,000.</p><p> The president also expected to call for tougher vetting rules.  This comes  as the Trump Administration's 120 day refugee ban actually expires today.</p><p> Programming note for all of you, President Trump is going to be \"Lou Dobbs  Tonight\" for an exclusive interview.  That is tomorrow, 7:00p.m. Eastern  Time right here on the  FOX Business Network, don't miss that interview.</p><p> Well, Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is in Pakistan today.  He told  reporters he's going to pressure Pakistani leaders to stop the support of  the Taliban and other terrorist groups that they receive in that country.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have made some very specific request  at Pakistan, this is the conditions-based approach.  And so our  relationship with Pakistan will also be conditions-based.</p><p> It will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary.   The Pakistan needs I think take a clear eye view of the situation that  they're confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations  that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  We should add that Pakistan still denies providing a safe haven  for terrorists.  </p><p> Well, Amazon says 238 cities and regions have submitted bids for its second  headquarters.  The cities include New York, Boston, Atlanta, Nashville,  Tennessee, even Austin, Texas.  And get this, Puerto Rico.  Amazon says  it's going to make a decision on the location at some point next year.  </p><p> Now technology stocks have been sinking ahead of Amazon's earnings.  Those  earnings due out Thursday after the bell.  Of course, we're going to have  them for you on FOX Business.  </p><p> And Delta Airlines is putting up the help wanted sign.  The carrier looking  to hire about a thousand flight attendants for next year and there is no  shortage of applicants, 125,000 applications have been received so far.   Delta shares about eight percent for 2017.</p><p> Also Delta is ditching Microsoft in favor of Apple.  A technology website  is reporting that Delta's only 30,000 crew members are going to get iPad  and iPhones reversing a deal with Microsoft that the carrier had announced  just four years ago.</p><p> iPads in the cockpit, I don't know Maria.  And those are your headlines  from New York.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  We are looking at this  market, really continue the momentum.  Dagen, Lawrence, Kevin, what is it  going to do at this point given that we still haven't seen the policy but  it feels like the president is trying to move up the tax reform deadline.   How do you see it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that this market does hinge on what comes out of  Washington at this point because of the continued run with stocks closing  at all time highs on Friday but DOW, Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P500.</p><p> I think that one thing that people aren't factoring in, the possibility of  the new Federal Reserve chief that because, again, as you have a Fed that  is tightening monetary policy with higher rates but also I'm trying to  unwind or begin to unwind that is $4.5 trillion balanced sheet.</p><p> They hear a lot of unknowns in there that people are not really facing at  this point and then you have like foul ups like that 401K contribution  limit that the GOP was talking about dramatically cutting and then  President Trump had to come out and say, \"No\" and put the icksnay on that.   So I think that there's a lot of room for error.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what, you make a real -- incredible points that  you're making.  In terms of the Fed chairman, when I spoke with the  president at the end of last week, he basically narrowed it down, right?</p><p> He narrowed it down to two players as well as Janet Yellen.  He talked  about Jay Powell and he talked about John Taylor.  It looks like those are  the two favorite picks.</p><p> KELLY:  Maria, and I think one thing that came really across well in that  interview is that that was very presidential of Donald Trump to give kudos  to Janet Yellen and say that he likes her.</p><p> I mean she is the sitting Fed chairman and that's very important because  you want a nice continuity.  So should he not pick her, at least it was a  great signal to the market and I think that's why you saw the market not  selloff.</p><p> But when we were talking about the markets, I mean I don't think tax reform  is as important.  And one of the reasons why we're seeing in the earnings  cycle, people are talking about how global growth is doing.</p><p> Well look at the price of copper, it's over $7,000 a ton.  It's almost near  its 20 -- late 2013 peak of $7,430.  That's showing the global growth is  strong and these companies are benefiting from it.  Should we get tax  reform?  It's icing on the cake.</p><p> JONES:  But Maria, I do think that people are --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think this is a great point.  Yes.</p><p> JONES:  Yes.  Maria, I think people in the markets are optimistic about tax  reform but I think all eyes are on the city.  Remember, 200 bills passed  about the House that have died of (INAUDIBLE) in the Senate.</p><p> So a lot of people are worrying when it comes to the Senate.  But Americans  in the markets are optimistic that we could get something done.  I mean  this is something that democrats and republicans should be able to agree on  and it only strengthens the market when they see Washington working  together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so.  And he made the point of saying Rand  Paul will vote yes for tax reform.  He's focused on the Senate for sure.  </p><p> All right.  We are live form Riyadh this morning.  Let me take a short  break and come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's Tuesday morning everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p> We are looking at markets which are trading higher this morning.  Plus, new  allegations this morning of collusion between Russia and the Clintons.  The  House Oversight Committee is now investigating an Obama Era deal in which a  Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the United  States.</p><p> The former FBI informant who could offer more details about the deal, well  he's under a gag order apparently that prevents him from testifying before  the Congress.  The informant's lawyer question the legality of the order on  \"Lou Dobb's\" program last night, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, LAWYER:  If it does and it is unconstitutional and it's  invalid if it prohibits my client from giving information to the  legislature.  The executive cannot say to people, \"Hey, you can't give  information to another body of the government.\"</p><p> So you can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time  that all this bribery payments were made.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then, of course, there's House Oversight Committee Member,  Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, he appeared on FOX News over the weekend,  he calls for the Justice Department to remove the nondisclosure agreement  which prevents the former informant from testifying about the bribery  scheme before Congress.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBER:  This informant  wants to tell his story but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement  that was signed with the (INAUDIBLE) Justice Department.</p><p> He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta  Lynch Justice Department.  Clearly it's in the interest, in the public's  interest that this individual be able to tell the story to congress.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, during my exclusive interview at the end of last  week with President Trump, he told me that Special Counsel Robert Mueller  should stop probing the Uranium One deal.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The uranium situation with  Russia getting uranium, they better look into that.  That is looking like a  very serious situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is he going to look into it?</p><p> TRUMP:   I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  That's up to them but I can  tell you Senator Grassley wants to look into it and others do but that's to  me a very, very serious charge.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Lawrence Jones, let's talk about this for a second because  for years before the Clinton State Department, for years the Russians  wanted to buy uranium.  Let's just call this what it is.  Uranium is used  to make a nuclear bomb.</p><p> JONES:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they wanted to buy uranium.  They wanted to buy uranium and  president after president said, \"No, no, no, no, no, no we're not going to  sell our uranium.\"</p><p> All of a sudden under Hillary Clinton State Department, she --</p><p> JONES:  A deal was cut.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- approves 20 percent of the U.S.'s stock pile of uranium and  then she gets $140 million sent to her Clinton Foundation?</p><p> JONES:  A lot of shady business.  Now, we don't know if there was evidence  of wrong doing but there's a lot of smoke there that should have been  investigated.  </p><p> And I think it's particularly concerning Maria that Congress didn't know  anything about this but a lot of people within the department for eight  years knew this was going on and didn't report.  We've had leaks on  everything else and here was no leaks on this particular problem.</p><p> What we didn't know after looking into this when it come -- concerning this  whole uranium thing is that Obama knew as well.  He knew this and still  didn't tell Congress ,didn't notify the proper channels in this until I  think that's problematic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well it looks like a quid quo pro going on and she's  getting all that money.  She sells the uranium.  And by the way, we should  point out that the company that bought the uranium is Kremlin backed.  I  mean this was a government backed company that wanted the uranium.  </p><p> JONES:  That's correct.  And we also know now Maria because of more  investigation that the Russians were also trying to influence Hillary  Clinton as well.  That's more developments that we got out of this  particular story particularly from the Hill.</p><p> So now we know that it wasn't just Donald Trump that all these players were  trying to influence, it was everyone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we also should point out that around that same time Bill  Clinton, Former President Clinton was getting paid, what, $500,000 for a  speech in Moscow?  </p><p> JONES:  Which they did not disclose.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he was getting other money.  Yes.</p><p> JONES:  Exactly.  Which they did not dis --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Separating apart from the $140 million.</p><p> JONES:  Correct Maria.  And remember, they had an agreement when this first  started that they were supposed to notify the Obama Administration to  prevent this type of wrong doing from happening.  And it looks like they  knew and didn't say anything. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All of this exchange of money and yet we're still talking  about potential collusion with the Trump Administration, incredible.</p><p> All right.  We will keep following that for you.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, is it a Snap flop?  Snap's vision for  spectacles not so clear.  We will tell you about that.</p><p> And then the fall classic may have to get a new name this year.  Why the  world series maybe hotter than ever but not for the reason that you think.   We're on it, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, everybody!  Thanks so much for joining  us.  Welcome back!  We are live this morning, it is Tuesday, October 24th,  we're coming to you from Riyadh.  Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on  the East Coast.  And earnings (INAUDIBLE) and starts on Wall Street this  morning.  </p><p> We've got General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, United Technology, just  a few of the names due out before the opening bell -- that is what's going  to set the tone for markets today.  We'll have the numbers as soon as they  hit the tape.  Eli Lili just reported minutes ago; the company beat  expectation on both earnings and revenue.  Take a look at the shares, Eli  Lili now at 87 and change.  </p><p> Earnings expected to drive markets today.  Futures are pointing higher  today, got a pretty good, firmer tone this morning on Wall Street.  Take a  look, we're at the highs of the morning right here; Dow Industrials set to  open about 55 points -- that's a quarter of a percent higher.  NASDAQ,  S&amp;P500 also higher this morning, as you see there.  </p><p> In Europe, stocks are searching for direction.  In fact, the FTSE100 is not  so far away from breaking even right now.  Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE up five points; the CAC Quarante is up a third of a percent,  16 points higher; and Dax Index in Germany, up 24 right now.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly higher, as you will here.  Best performer  overnight was the Nikkei Average, up half-of-a-percent in Japan.  Some real  momentum going on in Japan, recently.  Shanghai Composite up a quarter-of- a-percent as well.</p><p> Tackling tax reform; that is the focus in the U.S.  President Trump is  taking his tax cut quest to Capitol Hill today, with something of a pep  talk to Republican Senators.  He talked about the chances of getting  through during my one-on-one exclusive interview just this week.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we have the votes.   We have tremendous enthusiasm this time.  Healthcare, I was told it was  tougher, but it was close.  I mean, so far, I would say it's not even a  contest.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to break down the timeline for tax reform; it  could happen sooner than you think.  We'll tell you what we know now.  </p><p> Plus, reducing the reach: Facebook is testing a new feature that would  split its news feed varying publishers that don't pay up.  The social media  giant's response to the controversy this morning, coming up.  </p><p> And not sorry, Ms. Jackson; why the NFL is denying that the lead band,  Janet Jackson, amid backlash over Justin Timberlake upcoming Super Bowl  half-time show.  Remember the wardrobe malfunction a couple years ago?  All  right.  We'll get into it.  </p><p> Plus, the World Series; the hottest men ticking in town, literally.   Tonight's game, one could be the hottest start to the fall classic you've  ever seen.  We will have a preview of Astros-Dodgers showdown in Los  Angeles, coming up this morning.  </p><p> But, first, I am coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment  Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Among the big names I'll be speaking  with, coming up this morning: The Chairman of the Country's Sovereign  Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, his royal highness,  Prince Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, is with me.  I met with his royal  highness yesterday and he explained to me what the goal is, how they are  trying to get new money into the country and create some of a tourist spot  in Saudi Arabia.  We're going to tell you all about it.  </p><p> But, first, our top stories right now this half an hour: tax reform on  Capitol Hill, President Trump is set to meet with Republican Senators at  the weekly public lunch today -- that is the policy lunch.  At the top of  the agenda, a tax overhaul.  This, as Ivanka Trump touted the  administration's tax plan during a town hall event last night in  Pennsylvania, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> IVANKA TRUMP, ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  This tax reform really  couples two things that are really core values as a country which is work  and supporting the American family.  There are many elements of this tax  plan that, I think, are squarely targeted at creating jobs in this country,  creating growth in this country, and offering relief to our middle-income  families. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk about that and the impact on  business, the engineering and infrastructure company AECOM CEO Michael  Burke.  Michael, it's good to have you on the program today.  </p><p> MICHAEL BURKE, CEO, AECOM:  Great!  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So, I want to ask you, really,  why you would come to an investment conference like this.  I know that  infrastructure is very important all around the world, first, though, you  think the big opportunity for infrastructure is in the United States?  </p><p> BURKE:  Sure, the infrastructure opportunity right now is clearly in the  United States.  And there are many countries around the world, sovereign  wealth funds like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia here today that's looking to  invest their capital in infrastructure in the United States.  But  additionally, we are working on infrastructure projects here in the country  like the Riyadh Metro System right here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now you are -- I want to ask you about that because this  is, like, a whole new cultural change that's going on here.  But, first, in  terms of the U.S., and the tax plan, and infrastructure plan, do you expect  -- when I asked the president about this, this week, he said, yes, I'm  going to do an infrastructure plan in 2018, you wanted to see it sooner  rather than later, obviously?  </p><p> BURKE:  Certainly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you think it's coming?</p><p> BURKE:  It's definitely coming.  I was hoping for it to come much sooner.   I really thought it was going to be the top priority of the administration.   We have broad bipartisan support in Washington on both sides of the aisle  on Capitol Hill, and we have administrative support.  And so, we had really  a strong, strong support, and I thought it would've been top of the agenda,  but that's not the course that it took.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, where do you see the opportunity in the U.S. in terms of  infrastructure, what do you want to see done?  I mean, are you talking  about roads, bridges, what's the big -- big idea?  </p><p> BURKE:  Yes, transportation is probably the single area that requires the  most focus, to reduce the friction on the economy but we also have an  outdated water infrastructure system across the country, we have rural  broadband that is way behind the urban environment that needs  infrastructure support.  And I really think the big idea is incenting the  private sector to bring these large pools of capital.  You hear it here  today in Riyadh; there's $22 trillion of assets represented by the people  persuaded in this conference that want to invest in infrastructure. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, infrastructure, obviously, important for this  administration; what about tax reform?  How big of an impact is that going  to have on business and on economic growth?  </p><p> BURKE:  Tax reform is critical.  As you know, we have the highest corporate  tax rate among all the OECD countries, so it's critical to make sure that  the U.S. is competitive from a business attractiveness perspective.  And  ultimately, GDP growth will contribute to infrastructure growth.  So, we  have to get the economy growing, we need to have a competitive tax rate,  and that will produce jobs, produce GDP that will then fund infrastructure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think that they're going to get caught up in the debates  or the pushback, like for example on the state and local tax deduction?  A  lot of people are saying, look, I'm not going to vote, yes, for that, that  means a tax increase for some of our constituents.  So, is that going to  hold up tax reform?  </p><p> BURKE:  It's one of the many challenges of tax reform.  And I think right  now, we do have both sides of the aisle that are interested in the lower  corporate rate, but we need to pay for us.  And the state tax deduction is  one of those items that are on the table, and somebody's going to have to  compromise significantly to get this across the finish line, and I expect  they'll get it done by December.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Take me to Saudi Arabia, then, tell me what you're  doing here, what you want to do here?  This is some grand ambitions to turn  Saudi Arabia into a tourist spot, open it up to foreign investment, fix in  infrastructure or create to infrastructure that doesn't exist right now in  some cities, is it doable, can they pull this off?  </p><p> BURKE:  You know, I think they can.  You know, it's an exciting time here.   They've set forth the long-term 2030 vision, and that's the start of the  plan.  And they are really focused on diversifying away from oil and they  have the right vision, and we're seeing some great ideas and we're working  on some great ideas for the country to develop new cities.  And they have  to have not only a vision, but a real differentiator, and so we're looking  at cities that will bring in robotics, and bring in a whole new host of  technologies that will differentiate them.  We're looking at new cities  that will bring entertainment into Riyadh which has long been avoided.  And  so, it's an exciting time here. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It really is.  I remember saying earlier that a lot of people,  they leave every Friday, they want entertainment, and they go find it; they  find it in Dubai and elsewhere.  And now, the Saudi leadership is saying,  why are we doing this, why are we allowing all of our money to leave?  </p><p> BURKE:  We're seeing it up on the Red Sea.  And the Red Sea has beautiful,  beautiful beach fronts.  And I think these developments will be our aim to  keeping Saudis in the country when they want to take holiday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's an important plan and certainly ambitious.  Michael,  we'll be watching.  Great to have you on the program today.  </p><p> BURKE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Michael Burke, joining us there.  We'll take  a break.  When we come back, remember Janet Jackson?  There's a new Super  Bowl controversy right now.  The NFL is issuing a new statement about the  superstar, 14 years after that wardrobe malfunction with Justin Timberlake,  find out why.  And then, hungry for good news?  Well, we're keeping an eye  on Chipotle as the company reports earnings after the bell tonight.  We'll  tell you what people are expecting after a tough period for that stock,  back in a minute right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for being with us  this morning.  Happy Tuesday!  We are coming to you live today from Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia.  Market is looking higher; we're at the highs of the morning  right now.  Dow Industrials set to open up 60 points; earnings in focus,  obviously.  </p><p> A couple of names we're watching related earnings.  We are watching the  companies set to report before the open today, 3M, and also looking  earnings of 2.21 a share, that, of course, the third-quarter.  Shares of 3M  are up nearly 25 percent this year.  </p><p> Also watching shares of Chipotle; the company set to report its third- quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  It's had a rough year.  Analysts  are looking for earnings of $1.63 a share.  The stock down better than 20  percent over the last year.  </p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, downplaying a test on its news feed.  You have to hear  this one, Cheryl Casone with the details in now New York, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  It's interesting, Maria, that Facebook test removed page post from  the news feed to a separate feed called explore.  But it's harder to find,  and the move cost a big drop in traffic in six different countries,  including Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia.  Facebook said it doesn't plan to  expand this test any further for now.  So, the test is over.  Meanwhile,  the company is said it's also experimenting with splitting its news feed in  two -- separating commercial posts from the personal news.  And its bid to  boost advertising from business -- there's the stock in the premarket up  slightly.  </p><p>Snapchat parent company, Snap, reportedly is stuck with hundreds of  thousands of unsold spectacles, that's because demand for those spectacles  quickly fell after last year's holiday shopping season.  Snap also let off  about a dozen employees that supported that division that was making the  spectacle, that happened just last month.  Taking a look at the stock,  Snap's down about 40 percent so far since the IPO, 40 percent.  </p><p> All right, now that Justin Timberlake is performing at Super Bowl, everyone  is wondering if Janet Jackson has been banned for making a guest  appearance.  You know, it's been almost 14 years since that infamous  wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl.  Well, speculation was rising  that the NFL had banned her.  The NFL is saying, though, in a statement,  nonsense, \"There's no ban.  We are not going to comment on any speculation  regarding potential guests.  There may be no guests.  Along with Pepsi,  we're excited to have Justin Timberlake.\"  Super Bowl 52, set for February  4th, guys, in Minneapolis.  </p><p> And baseball is hot right now, literally.  Los Angeles is in the grips of a  heat wave just as world series is getting underway tonight in Los Angeles.   Forecasters calling for temperatures to be near 100-degrees at game time.   The World Series record, we should add, for the hottest first-pitch  temperature was 94-degrees.  That was set in Phoenix, Arizona during game  one back in 2001, so we shall see.  First pitch tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern  Time.  And, of course, Maria, the game is going to be on Fox, back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Cool, all right, Cheryl, thank you.  We'll take a break when we  come back, companies such as Memphis Meats, they want to revolutionize the  way we eat.  The Venture Capital Company, 50 years, wants to revolutionize  the way we invest as well over the next 50.  Millennials and social  investing, that's next, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Live from the Future Investment Initiative here  in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning, we're talking about investing  globally, doing good in the world, making money in the process, that is the  idea behind venture capital firm, 50 Years, which is backing companies that  will have global impact for the next 50 years and beyond.  Joining us right  now for the first time in Fox Business Interview is 50 Years' Founding  Partner, Seth Bannon.  And Seth, it's good to have you on the program.   Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> SETH BANNON, FOUNDING PARTNER, 50 YEARS:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were talking during the commercial break about how  millennials don't necessarily care about making money only, they want a  purpose, they want to make sure they're doing the right thing.  Most people  want to make wealth, and then commit to solving the world's problems, why  do you think you could do this both?  </p><p> BANNON:  Well, millennials certainly think: you can.  So, if you ask any  other generation: what is the purpose of business, the vast majority of  them would say, some version of to make money -- of course, that's what a  job is for.  But if you ask millennials this, and (INAUDIBLE) actually did  a study of 7,700 millennials across 29 countries, and they asked them the  open-ended question: what is the purpose of business?  </p><p> In a plurality, 47 percent said some version of to improve society or  protect the environment.  Now, millennials also think that they should make  money, but they want to have it all in careers.  And so, our fund actually  believes that companies, if they want to recruit and retain the top talent  of tomorrow, we're going to have to offer millennials what they want, which  is to combine their values with their careers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?  What should we be aware of in terms of doing  just that?  </p><p> BANNON:  So, I mean, there's a plethora of problems in the world.  And  hence, a plethora of ways that you can both make money and do good.  So, I  think we're facing an incredible climate crisis, we're facing health  problems throughout the world, we're failing to feed the world, all of  these represent massive, massive industries where you can build business  that both make billions of dollars a year, and also do a lot of good in the  process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who's doing it well?  </p><p> BANNON:  Well, I always turn to our own portfolio.  One of the companies  that have been in the news recently called Memphis Meats, so they  essentially produce meats without the animal.  And so, you know, it's crazy  that in 2017 -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Explain how you do that: produce meat without the animal, I  don't get it.  </p><p> BANNON:  Yes, so they essentially farm cells directly.  So, you can sort of  think about it this way: so, a cow is essentially being used as a piece of  technology to take plant protein inputs and then convert them into outputs  that we like to eat, drink, or wear -- in this case, meat.  And inside the  cows, there are certain biological processes happening that are causing  that transition.  And so, the idea of Memphis Meats is what if we took the  same biological processes, we'll just bring them outside of the cow so that  we can the same delicious we want just without the animals.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that Richard Branson and Bill Gates  have invested in this company, right?  </p><p> BANNON:  They did.  And even more interestingly, we think, is Cardio  invested in -- it's one of the largest players in conventional meat  actually investing in our last round.  And the CEO Cargo was on this  network, recently, and talked about clean meat as an inevitability, as  something that's going to happen -- it'll happen in the next couple of  years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I was laughing when I was looking at some of the research  -- well, not laughing, but you're a part of the vegan mafia in Silicon  Valley, is that true?  Is that what they call it?  </p><p> BANNON:  Yes, exactly, yes.  So, the food system is broken from top to  bottom.  And one of the largest problems is actually animal agriculture  itself.  So, many people don't know this but animal agriculture contributes  more to greenhouse gas emissions than all planes, trains, trucks, boats,  and motorcycles combined.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, I didn't know that.</p><p> BANNON:  That's worse than all the transportation.  And it's failing to see  the world.  And factory farming has reached limits of scale, but it's still  not getting people in.  So, the vegan mafia believes that there are some  interesting solutions in either plant-based alternatives or clean meat or  what we call cellular agriculture to actually help solve these problems.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the next big wave of technology companies that you see  taking form in Silicon Valley right now?  Is this part of it, do they have  the vision to combine profit and social impact, tell us who is hot right  now, and where the next wave of growth is?  </p><p> BANNON:  We're very bullish on computational synthetic biology, we're very  bullish on space tech, we're bullish on medical devices.  Obviously,  machine learning is showing its face in every industry.  But I would say,  the single industry is we're most excited about called Cellular  Agriculture, and it's along the same lines.  It's essentially a new crop of  companies that are making the products that we all love from animals just  without the animals.  </p><p> So, we had personally invested in a company doing it for meat, the company  doing it for leather, company doing it for gelatin, company doing it for  milk proteins.  There are other companies doing it for eggs, for fish, even  for spider silk.

It is Tuesday, October 24th. Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings splits on Wall Street, among the big names set to report earnings this morning, General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, and United Technologies. We are bringing you all of the numbers as soon as they hit the tape and we will have the analysis as they come in. What do the numbers mean to you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures meanwhile showing the markets are looking higher this morning, take a look at what we've got, this momentum lives on. DOW Industrial set to open up about 45 points today, Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 also in positive territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, a bit of a different story, stocks are searching for some direction this morning. Take a look at the euro zone where the FTSE100 is up just a fraction and the CAC Krones and the DAX Index are up just about a quarter of a percent or so.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you'll see taking at cue once again. From the U.S., the Shanghai Composite, the Nikkei Average and the Kospi all fractionally better on the session. The Hang Seng lower by half a percent.</p><p>Well the Saudi Aramco IPO is on track apparently, the public investment fund managing director giving some hopes to big investors saying that the oil giant's public debut is still on schedule for next year despite the speculation that we are going to see some private investors getting on this deal like the Chinese which may very well still be likely.</p><p>The push for tax reform is on back in the U.S., <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>set to head to Capitol Hill today again to something of a pep talk to encourage republican senators to move forward on tax reform.</p><p>First daughter, <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>spoke about the importance of getting that reform passed, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>IVANKA TRUMP, </nameText></person>FIRST DAUGHTER: The tax reform is so critical. We're doing it administratively deregulation. Really fueling entrepreneurship in this country and you see it in terms of optimism, you see it in terms of the stock market.</p><p>I would hear it in every conversation I had with the people through the course of the day and in the room. So that's what fuels us and that's what we're fighting for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>The very latest as the House prepares to vote on that budget later this week which will move the process forward.</p><p>Uranium One, well the deal in question. The House is investigating reports this morning that an FBI informant was blocked by Obama Era Attorney General Loretta Lynch from testifying on information that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent dealings back in 2009. Why he was reportedly threatened with criminal action, we are on it this morning.</p><p>And then the quest for Amazon, the technology giant has already received 238 bids from cities hoping, looking to host the company's second U.S. headquarters. The details on who has the inside track coming up.</p><p>But first, I'm coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We are at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this morning, 2,500 delegates are here all looking to get a piece of this action.</p><p>There is something of a revolution going on in Saudi Arabia right now. They are starting from scratch hoping to build industries from tourism to medical devices, to all sorts of things that people want.</p><p>Basically every weekend lot of Saudis leave this area and go elsewhere to have some entertainment. They go to Dubai, they go to Qatar, other places other than Saudi Arabia. Now, the leadership here is saying, \"We want our people to spend their money here and we want foreign investments already.\"</p><p>So you're looking at an environment right now where you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh hoping to get a piece of this buildup. Buildup in infrastructure, buildup in medical technologies, buildup in tourism.</p><p>The area is absolutely beautiful, they are creating a new city which is going to be on the border of Egypt and Jordan right on the water and they're hoping to put hotels, really a change in terms of culture and a change in terms of perception.</p><p>That's why we're here today, we're getting an inside look at what's happening, and certainly all of the names that we will be speaking with today are going to tell us what specifically to expect as this country goes through dramatic change in the next five years.</p><p>We'll tell you all about it in the program this morning. Coming up, I'll be talking with the chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, the public investment fund, his royal highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman al- Saud.</p><p>I will speak with the crown prince, I've spent some time with him yesterday as he explained what is taking place. His royal highness has a vision, of course, blessed by the king of Saudi Arabia and they are putting that vision to work. That is why it has attracted so many dignitaries and delegates from around the world here this week.</p><p>I'm also speaking with Former Chairman and CEO of Arconic, Klaus Kleinfeld, he is going to be joining me on stage along with the Chairman and CEO of Softbank, Masayoshi Son, he is going to, of course, talk about he's allocating capital. He's got that $100 billion vision fund, everybody wants to get some investment from that vision fund.</p><p>He's going to talk to us about why it is so important to invest here. The Saudis gave him $45 billion as part of that $100 billion vision fund.</p><p>Also here the Blackstone Chairman and CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, he's going to join me coming up as well. He's on stage with me coming up along with Boston Dynamic CEO, Marc Raibert.</p><p>Raibert is basically talking about robotics, they're going to get robotics, drone, the whole host of new innovative technologies working on the ground here in Saudi. So we're going to hear about all the investment opportunities from this group coming up when I sit down with them on stage momentarily.</p><p>We will bring you that conference live as it happens.</p><p>First though, joining me from New York this morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly. And TheBlaze TV Host, Lawrence Jones. Great to see everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Great to see you Maria.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, THEBLAZE TV HOST: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You look fantastic as always.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, incredible. I mean markets, here we are in Saudi Arabia, you can't believe the number of people here trying to get a piece of the action basically because they're starting from scratch.</p><p>This is a completely changed idea in terms of what Saudi has been, a close society, they're trying to hard to open it. Question is, are they moving too fast? Will it be able to change the perception and get foreign money coming into the country?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. There's a front page article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about that very thing today Maria. It's so amazing that you're there that this is such a huge shift in terms of moving from investment fund if you will that invested in the Saudi Arabia and economy.</p><p>Investing in only domestic interest say banks, even a fish farm at one point but now trying to shift from being solely dependent on oil to technology investment. And the \"Journal\" points out that $3.5 billion investment in Uber sometime last year that didn't go that well with the ouster of the CEO of that company recently.</p><p>But I think that the amount of money at stake and the number of attendees at this conference, it's proof of how much money Saudi Arabia is going to be investing for decades to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're absolutely right. And you know, the Saudis gave Softbank $45 billion Kevin Kelly of that $100 billion vision fund. Don't forget, Alibaba was a big portion of the performance of that fund.</p><p>So are there other Alibaba's out there Kevin in terms of really hitting it big to keep up that incredible performance of the vision fund?</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: What I think is pretty interesting and unique is that most sovereign wealth funds or public investment funds they actually go very safe and conservative route.</p><p>They have a lot of stocks, a lot of stocks, a lot of bonds, if you look at another one that's Norway, they are very conservative. They have almost $1 trillion. And so this shows you the different tech that you need to do in today's environment.</p><p>And the Saudis are leading that, right? They're getting into venture capital, they're getting on the edge of technology which is so important today because we have such a dynamic shift that's happening in the marketplace.</p><p>And I think it's important to note that this is a smart move. Back in 2015 they realized they needed to cut their dependency on oil. And so for 40 years they were solely focused on it. So it 2015 they got aggressive and they got smart and the decided to diversify.</p><p>And that's what they need to do. So we'll have to see, there is another Alibaba out there, can they do it with Softbank? You know what, if history is any guide, they're going to have a good chance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well can we talk about tech for a second guys? I mean what's going on with this rollover? We saw the worst week since around the election for stocks like Google, Alphabet, as parents of Google, Amazon.</p><p>Going into these earnings, Amazon and Alphabet earnings, these stocks are really rolling over. What's going on with the broader market trading up and technology trading down?</p><p>KELLY: I think you're seeing a sector rotation and it's natural. I mean the market is up pretty significantly for the year and technology has led that. So people are getting into other areas of the market.</p><p>Financials actually took that leadership after they had a great earning season but it's also important to note that there's a lot of regulatory risk on the horizons for these technology companies.</p><p>When you started to see at Facebook, a lot of the Russian ads came in due effect, there's talk about Amazon and whether they need to be broken up. I mean we didn't hear that before and that actually weighed on big tech titans like IBM in the '60s as well as Microsoft back in the late '90s.</p><p>So this is pretty telling. The regulatory effects is actually what's worrying investors right now for putting new capital to work.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria, real quick in terms of earnings one thing to watch which dovetails with where you are and the upcoming Aramco IPO that the energy sector for the third quarter is trending up the most in terms of earnings growth.</p><p>Earnings are expected to be up 136 percent from one year ago. This is the energy sector in the United States, that's up from 129 percent growth just one month ago. So a big rebound for energy earnings and expectations are going up as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. Wow. One of the biggest headlines to come out of this conference so far was that Saudi ARamco IPO was actually on track.</p><p>So the public investment funds managing director, the oil giant's public debut he said is still on schedule for the second half of the year, this sovereign wealth fund is going to become one of the world's largest investors.</p><p>And you said the \"Journal\" story today points out that the fund already had some trouble in terms of lack (INAUDIBLE) or performances like Uber. So you've got Uber there, you've got this fund looking for the big highlights in terms of where the growth comes from next.</p><p>They are all setting their sites on innovation, technology, things like drones. Lawrence Jones, what's on your radar this morning?</p><p>JONES: When I look at what's on my radar, it's this stuff with Russia considering that the Clintons had something going on that the Congress did not know about that the FBI knew about it and now they're trying to conduct and investigation.</p><p>But we did not know. So that's problematic for me. I'm interested to see what's going to come out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we're going to have more on that coming up on the program. As you know, I interviewed John Podesta about this very subject a long time ago. And so we pointed out that there's something about Russia and the democrats to talk about.</p><p>Not necessarily this administration and the Russians but we're investigating both sides of it, so we'll come up -- come back with more on that coming up.</p><p>Meanwhile, a lot of earnings on the table, that's going to set the tone for markets today as soon. As soon as those numbers come out, we're going to bring them to you and, of course, there's all this anticipation about the tech earnings after the bell.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back, Uranium One deal in question, the House investigating reports that an FBI informant was blocked from testifying on information that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent deals back in 2009 under Hillary Clinton's watch as she was Secretary of the State.</p><p>And then let the games begin, from Coast-to-Coast, from cities big and small, find out just how many cities are battling and trying to get Amazon's attention for Amazon's new headquarters.</p><p>All that coming right here live from Riyadh and New York this Tuesday morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning. Welcome back everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is set to announce today a title cap on the number of refugees entering the United States. Cheryl Casone on headlines right now with details. Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And good morning Maria. So under these new rules the U.S. would limit refugee admissions to 45,000 down from 110,000.</p><p>The president also expected to call for tougher vetting rules. This comes as the Trump Administration's 120 day refugee ban actually expires today.</p><p>Programming note for all of you, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is going to be \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" for an exclusive interview. That is tomorrow, 7:00p.m. Eastern Time right here on the FOX Business Network, don't miss that interview.</p><p>Well, Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is in Pakistan today. He told reporters he's going to pressure Pakistani leaders to stop the support of the Taliban and other terrorist groups that they receive in that country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We have made some very specific request at Pakistan, this is the conditions-based approach. And so our relationship with Pakistan will also be conditions-based.</p><p>It will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary. The Pakistan needs I think take a clear eye view of the situation that they're confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: We should add that Pakistan still denies providing a safe haven for terrorists.</p><p>Well, Amazon says 238 cities and regions have submitted bids for its second headquarters. The cities include New York, Boston, Atlanta, Nashville, Tennessee, even Austin, Texas. And get this, Puerto Rico. Amazon says it's going to make a decision on the location at some point next year.</p><p>Now technology stocks have been sinking ahead of Amazon's earnings. Those earnings due out Thursday after the bell. Of course, we're going to have them for you on FOX Business.</p><p>And Delta Airlines is putting up the help wanted sign. The carrier looking to hire about a thousand flight attendants for next year and there is no shortage of applicants, 125,000 applications have been received so far. Delta shares about eight percent for 2017.</p><p>Also Delta is ditching Microsoft in favor of Apple. A technology website is reporting that Delta's only 30,000 crew members are going to get iPad and iPhones reversing a deal with Microsoft that the carrier had announced just four years ago.</p><p>iPads in the cockpit, I don't know Maria. And those are your headlines from New York. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much Cheryl. We are looking at this market, really continue the momentum. Dagen, Lawrence, Kevin, what is it going to do at this point given that we still haven't seen the policy but it feels like the president is trying to move up the tax reform deadline. How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that this market does hinge on what comes out of Washington at this point because of the continued run with stocks closing at all time highs on Friday but DOW, Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P500.</p><p>I think that one thing that people aren't factoring in, the possibility of the new Federal Reserve chief that because, again, as you have a Fed that is tightening monetary policy with higher rates but also I'm trying to unwind or begin to unwind that is $4.5 trillion balanced sheet.</p><p>They hear a lot of unknowns in there that people are not really facing at this point and then you have like foul ups like that 401K contribution limit that the GOP was talking about dramatically cutting and then <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had to come out and say, \"No\" and put the icksnay on that. So I think that there's a lot of room for error.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You know what, you make a real -- incredible points that you're making. In terms of the Fed chairman, when I spoke with the president at the end of last week, he basically narrowed it down, right?</p><p>He narrowed it down to two players as well as Janet Yellen. He talked about Jay Powell and he talked about John Taylor. It looks like those are the two favorite picks.</p><p>KELLY: Maria, and I think one thing that came really across well in that interview is that that was very presidential of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to give kudos to Janet Yellen and say that he likes her.</p><p>I mean she is the sitting Fed chairman and that's very important because you want a nice continuity. So should he not pick her, at least it was a great signal to the market and I think that's why you saw the market not selloff.</p><p>But when we were talking about the markets, I mean I don't think tax reform is as important. And one of the reasons why we're seeing in the earnings cycle, people are talking about how global growth is doing.</p><p>Well look at the price of copper, it's over $7,000 a ton. It's almost near its 20 -- late 2013 peak of $7,430. That's showing the global growth is strong and these companies are benefiting from it. Should we get tax reform? It's icing on the cake.</p><p>JONES: But Maria, I do think that people are --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is a great point. Yes.</p><p>JONES: Yes. Maria, I think people in the markets are optimistic about tax reform but I think all eyes are on the city. Remember, 200 bills passed about the House that have died of (INAUDIBLE) in the Senate.</p><p>So a lot of people are worrying when it comes to the Senate. But Americans in the markets are optimistic that we could get something done. I mean this is something that democrats and republicans should be able to agree on and it only strengthens the market when they see Washington working together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You would think so. And he made the point of saying Rand Paul will vote yes for tax reform. He's focused on the Senate for sure.</p><p>All right. We are live form Riyadh this morning. Let me take a short break and come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's Tuesday morning everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment Initiative Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We are looking at markets which are trading higher this morning. Plus, new allegations this morning of collusion between Russia and the Clintons. The House Oversight Committee is now investigating an Obama Era deal in which a Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the United States.</p><p>The former FBI informant who could offer more details about the deal, well he's under a gag order apparently that prevents him from testifying before the Congress. The informant's lawyer question the legality of the order on \"Lou Dobb's\" program last night, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, LAWYER: If it does and it is unconstitutional and it's invalid if it prohibits my client from giving information to the legislature. The executive cannot say to people, \"Hey, you can't give information to another body of the government.\"</p><p>So you can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all this bribery payments were made.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then, of course, there's House Oversight Committee Member, Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, he appeared on FOX News over the weekend, he calls for the Justice Department to remove the nondisclosure agreement which prevents the former informant from testifying about the bribery scheme before Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBER: This informant wants to tell his story but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement that was signed with the (INAUDIBLE) Justice Department.</p><p>He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta Lynch Justice Department. Clearly it's in the interest, in the public's interest that this individual be able to tell the story to congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, during my exclusive interview at the end of last week with <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>he told me that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should stop probing the Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The uranium situation with Russia getting uranium, they better look into that. That is looking like a very serious situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is he going to look into it?</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, I don't know. That's up to them but I can tell you Senator Grassley wants to look into it and others do but that's to me a very, very serious charge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Lawrence Jones, let's talk about this for a second because for years before the Clinton State Department, for years the Russians wanted to buy uranium. Let's just call this what it is. Uranium is used to make a nuclear bomb.</p><p>JONES: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So they wanted to buy uranium. They wanted to buy uranium and president after president said, \"No, no, no, no, no, no we're not going to sell our uranium.\"</p><p>All of a sudden under Hillary Clinton State Department, she --</p><p>JONES: A deal was cut.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- approves 20 percent of the U.S.'s stock pile of uranium and then she gets $140 million sent to her Clinton Foundation?</p><p>JONES: A lot of shady business. Now, we don't know if there was evidence of wrong doing but there's a lot of smoke there that should have been investigated.</p><p>And I think it's particularly concerning Maria that Congress didn't know anything about this but a lot of people within the department for eight years knew this was going on and didn't report. We've had leaks on everything else and here was no leaks on this particular problem.</p><p>What we didn't know after looking into this when it come -- concerning this whole uranium thing is that Obama knew as well. He knew this and still didn't tell Congress ,didn't notify the proper channels in this until I think that's problematic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well it looks like a quid quo pro going on and she's getting all that money. She sells the uranium. And by the way, we should point out that the company that bought the uranium is Kremlin backed. I mean this was a government backed company that wanted the uranium.</p><p>JONES: That's correct. And we also know now Maria because of more investigation that the Russians were also trying to influence Hillary Clinton as well. That's more developments that we got out of this particular story particularly from the Hill.</p><p>So now we know that it wasn't just <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>that all these players were trying to influence, it was everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we also should point out that around that same time Bill Clinton, Former President Clinton was getting paid, what, $500,000 for a speech in Moscow?</p><p>JONES: Which they did not disclose.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he was getting other money. Yes.</p><p>JONES: Exactly. Which they did not dis --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Separating apart from the $140 million.</p><p>JONES: Correct Maria. And remember, they had an agreement when this first started that they were supposed to notify the Obama Administration to prevent this type of wrong doing from happening. And it looks like they knew and didn't say anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All of this exchange of money and yet we're still talking about potential collusion with the Trump Administration, incredible.</p><p>All right. We will keep following that for you. We're going to take a short break. When we come back, is it a Snap flop? Snap's vision for spectacles not so clear. We will tell you about that.</p><p>And then the fall classic may have to get a new name this year. Why the world series maybe hotter than ever but not for the reason that you think. We're on it, stay with us.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Here again is <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning, everybody! Thanks so much for joining us. Welcome back! We are live this morning, it is Tuesday, October 24th, we're coming to you from Riyadh. Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. And earnings (INAUDIBLE) and starts on Wall Street this morning.</p><p>We've got General Motors, Caterpillar, McDonald's, United Technology, just a few of the names due out before the opening bell -- that is what's going to set the tone for markets today. We'll have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape. Eli Lili just reported minutes ago; the company beat expectation on both earnings and revenue. Take a look at the shares, Eli Lili now at 87 and change.</p><p>Earnings expected to drive markets today. Futures are pointing higher today, got a pretty good, firmer tone this morning on Wall Street. Take a look, we're at the highs of the morning right here; Dow Industrials set to open about 55 points -- that's a quarter of a percent higher. NASDAQ, S&amp;P500 also higher this morning, as you see there.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are searching for direction. In fact, the FTSE100 is not so far away from breaking even right now. Take a look at European indices with the FTSE up five points; the CAC Quarante is up a third of a percent, 16 points higher; and Dax Index in Germany, up 24 right now. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, as you will here. Best performer overnight was the Nikkei Average, up half-of-a-percent in Japan. Some real momentum going on in Japan, recently. Shanghai Composite up a quarter-of- a-percent as well.</p><p>Tackling tax reform; that is the focus in the U.S.<person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is taking his tax cut quest to Capitol Hill today, with something of a pep talk to Republican Senators. He talked about the chances of getting through during my one-on-one exclusive interview just this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think we have the votes. We have tremendous enthusiasm this time. Healthcare, I was told it was tougher, but it was close. I mean, so far, I would say it's not even a contest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're going to break down the timeline for tax reform; it could happen sooner than you think. We'll tell you what we know now.</p><p>Plus, reducing the reach: Facebook is testing a new feature that would split its news feed varying publishers that don't pay up. The social media giant's response to the controversy this morning, coming up.</p><p>And not sorry, Ms. Jackson; why the NFL is denying that the lead band, Janet Jackson, amid backlash over Justin Timberlake upcoming Super Bowl half-time show. Remember the wardrobe malfunction a couple years ago? All right. We'll get into it.</p><p>Plus, the World Series; the hottest men ticking in town, literally. Tonight's game, one could be the hottest start to the fall classic you've ever seen. We will have a preview of Astros-Dodgers showdown in Los Angeles, coming up this morning.</p><p>But, first, I am coming to you live this morning from the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Among the big names I'll be speaking with, coming up this morning: The Chairman of the Country's Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, his royal highness, Prince Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, is with me. I met with his royal highness yesterday and he explained to me what the goal is, how they are trying to get new money into the country and create some of a tourist spot in Saudi Arabia. We're going to tell you all about it.</p><p>But, first, our top stories right now this half an hour: tax reform on Capitol Hill, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is set to meet with Republican Senators at the weekly public lunch today -- that is the policy lunch. At the top of the agenda, a tax overhaul. This, as <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>touted the administration's tax plan during a town hall event last night in Pennsylvania, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>IVANKA TRUMP, </nameText></person>ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: This tax reform really couples two things that are really core values as a country which is work and supporting the American family. There are many elements of this tax plan that, I think, are squarely targeted at creating jobs in this country, creating growth in this country, and offering relief to our middle-income families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk about that and the impact on business, the engineering and infrastructure company AECOM CEO Michael Burke. Michael, it's good to have you on the program today.</p><p>MICHAEL BURKE, CEO, AECOM: Great! Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. So, I want to ask you, really, why you would come to an investment conference like this. I know that infrastructure is very important all around the world, first, though, you think the big opportunity for infrastructure is in the United States?</p><p>BURKE: Sure, the infrastructure opportunity right now is clearly in the United States. And there are many countries around the world, sovereign wealth funds like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia here today that's looking to invest their capital in infrastructure in the United States. But additionally, we are working on infrastructure projects here in the country like the Riyadh Metro System right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Now you are -- I want to ask you about that because this is, like, a whole new cultural change that's going on here. But, first, in terms of the U.S., and the tax plan, and infrastructure plan, do you expect -- when I asked the president about this, this week, he said, yes, I'm going to do an infrastructure plan in 2018, you wanted to see it sooner rather than later, obviously?</p><p>BURKE: Certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you think it's coming?</p><p>BURKE: It's definitely coming. I was hoping for it to come much sooner. I really thought it was going to be the top priority of the administration. We have broad bipartisan support in Washington on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, and we have administrative support. And so, we had really a strong, strong support, and I thought it would've been top of the agenda, but that's not the course that it took.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, where do you see the opportunity in the U.S. in terms of infrastructure, what do you want to see done? I mean, are you talking about roads, bridges, what's the big -- big idea?</p><p>BURKE: Yes, transportation is probably the single area that requires the most focus, to reduce the friction on the economy but we also have an outdated water infrastructure system across the country, we have rural broadband that is way behind the urban environment that needs infrastructure support. And I really think the big idea is incenting the private sector to bring these large pools of capital. You hear it here today in Riyadh; there's $22 trillion of assets represented by the people persuaded in this conference that want to invest in infrastructure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, infrastructure, obviously, important for this administration; what about tax reform? How big of an impact is that going to have on business and on economic growth?</p><p>BURKE: Tax reform is critical. As you know, we have the highest corporate tax rate among all the OECD countries, so it's critical to make sure that the U.S. is competitive from a business attractiveness perspective. And ultimately, GDP growth will contribute to infrastructure growth. So, we have to get the economy growing, we need to have a competitive tax rate, and that will produce jobs, produce GDP that will then fund infrastructure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that they're going to get caught up in the debates or the pushback, like for example on the state and local tax deduction? A lot of people are saying, look, I'm not going to vote, yes, for that, that means a tax increase for some of our constituents. So, is that going to hold up tax reform?</p><p>BURKE: It's one of the many challenges of tax reform. And I think right now, we do have both sides of the aisle that are interested in the lower corporate rate, but we need to pay for us. And the state tax deduction is one of those items that are on the table, and somebody's going to have to compromise significantly to get this across the finish line, and I expect they'll get it done by December.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Take me to Saudi Arabia, then, tell me what you're doing here, what you want to do here? This is some grand ambitions to turn Saudi Arabia into a tourist spot, open it up to foreign investment, fix in infrastructure or create to infrastructure that doesn't exist right now in some cities, is it doable, can they pull this off?</p><p>BURKE: You know, I think they can. You know, it's an exciting time here. They've set forth the long-term 2030 vision, and that's the start of the plan. And they are really focused on diversifying away from oil and they have the right vision, and we're seeing some great ideas and we're working on some great ideas for the country to develop new cities. And they have to have not only a vision, but a real differentiator, and so we're looking at cities that will bring in robotics, and bring in a whole new host of technologies that will differentiate them. We're looking at new cities that will bring entertainment into Riyadh which has long been avoided. And so, it's an exciting time here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is. I remember saying earlier that a lot of people, they leave every Friday, they want entertainment, and they go find it; they find it in Dubai and elsewhere. And now, the Saudi leadership is saying, why are we doing this, why are we allowing all of our money to leave?</p><p>BURKE: We're seeing it up on the Red Sea. And the Red Sea has beautiful, beautiful beach fronts. And I think these developments will be our aim to keeping Saudis in the country when they want to take holiday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's an important plan and certainly ambitious. Michael, we'll be watching. Great to have you on the program today.</p><p>BURKE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Michael Burke, joining us there. We'll take a break. When we come back, remember Janet Jackson? There's a new Super Bowl controversy right now. The NFL is issuing a new statement about the superstar, 14 years after that wardrobe malfunction with Justin Timberlake, find out why. And then, hungry for good news? Well, we're keeping an eye on Chipotle as the company reports earnings after the bell tonight. We'll tell you what people are expecting after a tough period for that stock, back in a minute right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back! I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>thanks for being with us this morning. Happy Tuesday! We are coming to you live today from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Market is looking higher; we're at the highs of the morning right now. Dow Industrials set to open up 60 points; earnings in focus, obviously.</p><p>A couple of names we're watching related earnings. We are watching the companies set to report before the open today, 3M, and also looking earnings of 2.21 a share, that, of course, the third-quarter. Shares of 3M are up nearly 25 percent this year.</p><p>Also watching shares of Chipotle; the company set to report its third- quarter earnings after the bell tonight. It's had a rough year. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.63 a share. The stock down better than 20 percent over the last year.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, downplaying a test on its news feed. You have to hear this one, Cheryl Casone with the details in now New York, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: It's interesting, Maria, that Facebook test removed page post from the news feed to a separate feed called explore. But it's harder to find, and the move cost a big drop in traffic in six different countries, including Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia. Facebook said it doesn't plan to expand this test any further for now. So, the test is over. Meanwhile, the company is said it's also experimenting with splitting its news feed in two -- separating commercial posts from the personal news. And its bid to boost advertising from business -- there's the stock in the premarket up slightly.</p><p>Snapchat parent company, Snap, reportedly is stuck with hundreds of thousands of unsold spectacles, that's because demand for those spectacles quickly fell after last year's holiday shopping season. Snap also let off about a dozen employees that supported that division that was making the spectacle, that happened just last month. Taking a look at the stock, Snap's down about 40 percent so far since the IPO, 40 percent.</p><p>All right, now that Justin Timberlake is performing at Super Bowl, everyone is wondering if Janet Jackson has been banned for making a guest appearance. You know, it's been almost 14 years since that infamous wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl. Well, speculation was rising that the NFL had banned her. The NFL is saying, though, in a statement, nonsense, \"There's no ban. We are not going to comment on any speculation regarding potential guests. There may be no guests. Along with Pepsi, we're excited to have Justin Timberlake.\" Super Bowl 52, set for February 4th, guys, in Minneapolis.</p><p>And baseball is hot right now, literally. Los Angeles is in the grips of a heat wave just as world series is getting underway tonight in Los Angeles. Forecasters calling for temperatures to be near 100-degrees at game time. The World Series record, we should add, for the hottest first-pitch temperature was 94-degrees. That was set in Phoenix, Arizona during game one back in 2001, so we shall see. First pitch tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. And, of course, Maria, the game is going to be on Fox, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool, all right, Cheryl, thank you. We'll take a break when we come back, companies such as Memphis Meats, they want to revolutionize the way we eat. The Venture Capital Company, 50 years, wants to revolutionize the way we invest as well over the next 50. Millennials and social investing, that's next, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back! Live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning, we're talking about investing globally, doing good in the world, making money in the process, that is the idea behind venture capital firm, 50 Years, which is backing companies that will have global impact for the next 50 years and beyond. Joining us right now for the first time in Fox Business Interview is 50 Years' Founding Partner, Seth Bannon. And Seth, it's good to have you on the program. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SETH BANNON, FOUNDING PARTNER, 50 YEARS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We were talking during the commercial break about how millennials don't necessarily care about making money only, they want a purpose, they want to make sure they're doing the right thing. Most people want to make wealth, and then commit to solving the world's problems, why do you think you could do this both?</p><p>BANNON: Well, millennials certainly think: you can. So, if you ask any other generation: what is the purpose of business, the vast majority of them would say, some version of to make money -- of course, that's what a job is for. But if you ask millennials this, and (INAUDIBLE) actually did a study of 7,700 millennials across 29 countries, and they asked them the open-ended question: what is the purpose of business?</p><p>In a plurality, 47 percent said some version of to improve society or protect the environment. Now, millennials also think that they should make money, but they want to have it all in careers. And so, our fund actually believes that companies, if they want to recruit and retain the top talent of tomorrow, we're going to have to offer millennials what they want, which is to combine their values with their careers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do it? What should we be aware of in terms of doing just that?</p><p>BANNON: So, I mean, there's a plethora of problems in the world. And hence, a plethora of ways that you can both make money and do good. So, I think we're facing an incredible climate crisis, we're facing health problems throughout the world, we're failing to feed the world, all of these represent massive, massive industries where you can build business that both make billions of dollars a year, and also do a lot of good in the process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who's doing it well?</p><p>BANNON: Well, I always turn to our own portfolio. One of the companies that have been in the news recently called Memphis Meats, so they essentially produce meats without the animal. And so, you know, it's crazy that in 2017 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Explain how you do that: produce meat without the animal, I don't get it.</p><p>BANNON: Yes, so they essentially farm cells directly. So, you can sort of think about it this way: so, a cow is essentially being used as a piece of technology to take plant protein inputs and then convert them into outputs that we like to eat, drink, or wear -- in this case, meat. And inside the cows, there are certain biological processes happening that are causing that transition. And so, the idea of Memphis Meats is what if we took the same biological processes, we'll just bring them outside of the cow so that we can the same delicious we want just without the animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we should point out that Richard Branson and Bill Gates have invested in this company, right?</p><p>BANNON: They did. And even more interestingly, we think, is Cardio invested in -- it's one of the largest players in conventional meat actually investing in our last round. And the CEO Cargo was on this network, recently, and talked about clean meat as an inevitability, as something that's going to happen -- it'll happen in the next couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I was laughing when I was looking at some of the research -- well, not laughing, but you're a part of the vegan mafia in Silicon Valley, is that true? Is that what they call it?</p><p>BANNON: Yes, exactly, yes. So, the food system is broken from top to bottom. And one of the largest problems is actually animal agriculture itself. So, many people don't know this but animal agriculture contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than all planes, trains, trucks, boats, and motorcycles combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I didn't know that.</p><p>BANNON: That's worse than all the transportation. And it's failing to see the world. And factory farming has reached limits of scale, but it's still not getting people in. So, the vegan mafia believes that there are some interesting solutions in either plant-based alternatives or clean meat or what we call cellular agriculture to actually help solve these problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the next big wave of technology companies that you see taking form in Silicon Valley right now? Is this part of it, do they have the vision to combine profit and social impact, tell us who is hot right now, and where the next wave of growth is?</p><p>BANNON: We're very bullish on computational synthetic biology, we're very bullish on space tech, we're bullish on medical devices. Obviously, machine learning is showing its face in every industry. But I would say, the single industry is we're most excited about called Cellular Agriculture, and it's along the same lines. It's essentially a new crop of companies that are making the products that we all love from animals just without the animals.</p><p>So, we had personally invested in a company doing it for meat, the company doing it for leather, company doing it for gelatin, company doing it for milk proteins. There are other companies doing it for eggs, for fish, even for spider silk. We think it's going to be one of the most impactful and then profitable technology revolution that the world has ever seen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fascinating stuff. Seth, thank so much for sharing.</p><p>BANNON: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much, Seth Bannon, joining us there. Coming up, I will have much more live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I'll be talking with the Chairman of the country's Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund, his Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman al-Saud, will join me on stage along with Steve Schwartzman, and Masayoshi Son from Softbank, we will talk about the new ambitious plans coming out of Saudi Arabia coming up next, back in a moment.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative, here's <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>with the special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning, everybody, welcome back!

Technology stocks were still weak a day after the worst rout for the Nasdaq composite index since 2011.</p><p>KEEPING SCORE: The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell six points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,827 at noon Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,096. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,044.</p><p>BANK EARNINGS: JPMorgan Chasefell $1.90, or 3 percent, to $55.50 after the bank missed analysts' earnings estimates. JPMorgan, the nation's biggest bank by assets, said its earnings fell 20 percent in the first quarter as revenue from bond trading and mortgage lending fell.

The biotechnology stock is down 10 percent in 2014.</p><p>EARNINGS FEARS: Adding to jitters over tech, investors have grown skeptical that corporate earnings across industries will rise enough to keep the stock rally going after a nearly 30 percent gain in the S&amp;P 500 last year. Financial analysts expect first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 to drop 1.6 percent from a year earlier, according to a report released Friday from FactSet, a financial data provider. If that forecast is borne out, it would be only the second quarterly drop in three years.</p><p>BRIGHT SPOTS: Ford rose 17 cent, up 1 percent, to $15.81 after U.S. safety regulators decided against seeking a recall of Ford F-150 pickup trucks.

That was the worst since the Great Recession in 2009.</p><p>But investors have gotten some hopeful signs lately: Wall Street analysts have boosted their earnings forecasts slightly for the third quarter, according to FactSet Research. Typically, Wall Street cuts its projections the closer companies get to reporting their numbers.</p><p>On September 1, analysts were predicting a profit drop of 22.2% in the third quarter. Now, Wall Street is expecting a 21% drop. That's still a notable contraction, of course, but slightly less bad than the forecasts of just a month ago.</p><p>The same thing has happened with sales estimates. Revenue for the third quarter is currently expected to decline 3.6% from a year ago versus forecasts of a 4.1% drop at the start of September.</p><p>Have to admit it's getting better</p><p>Sure, these may sound like subtle, incremental changes. And they are. But it's all part of a bigger trend. Analysts also expect continued improvement for earnings in the fourth quarter, with a projected profit drop of 12.7% and sales decrease of 1.2%.</p><p>So Corporate America might be slowly turning the corner. </p><p>Wall Street is forecasting a sizable rebound in earnings and revenue for the first half of 2021, too, with profits set to rise nearly 13% in the first quarter of next year and soar 44% in the second quarter. </p><p>This earnings comeback is a big reason why stocks have skyrocketed from their March lows -- despite lingering concerns about coronavirus, worries about whether more stimulus is coming from Washington and, of course, questions about the upcoming presidential election (and how long it may take until a victor is declared).</p><p>\"The market is taking a lot of comfort from the fact that even though we are going to get a big decline in the third quarter, it was much worse three months ago\" said Deepak Puri, chief investment officer of the Americas for Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. </p><p>\"We are moving in the right direction. That is the comforting factor. Economies and businesses are starting to reopen,\" he added.</p><p>Puri also noted that it's encouraging to see that Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet, which make up a bulk of the S&amp;P 500, are unlikely to suffer much of a hit to sales and profits.</p><p>In addition, earnings are starting to improve for companies in cyclical sectors that were hardest hit during the early part of the spring slump, such as industrials, materials and energy. </p><p>Still, there are many wild cards in play that could wreak havoc on earnings going forward. </p><p>Could a Joe Biden win over President Trump lead to higher taxes and more regulations on banks? Possibly. A second wave of Covid-19 cases in America also could cripple earnings growth and the broader economy. </p><p>That's why Puri concedes that investors have to take current forecasts with a grain of salt. </p><p>\"Estimates could go higher in 2021 due to expectations for a fast recovery. But the outlook is highly uncertain,\" he said. \"Reality almost never syncs up with the early estimates from analysts.\" </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Strategist: 2021 earnings won't hit 2019 levels The bad news: Profits probably fell more than 20% compared to a year ago -- the second-worst drop since 2009. The good news: That's actually an improvement over the second quarter, when earnings suffered a more than 30% plunge. That was the worst since the Great Recession in 2009. But investors have gotten some hopeful signs lately: Wall Street analysts have boosted their earnings forecasts slightly for the third quarter, according to FactSet Research. Typically, Wall Street cuts its projections the closer companies get to reporting their numbers. On September 1, analysts were predicting a profit drop of 22.2% in the third quarter. Now, Wall Street is expecting a 21% drop. That's still a notable contraction, of course, but slightly less bad than the forecasts of just a month ago. The same thing has happened with sales estimates. Revenue for the third quarter is currently expected to decline 3.6% from a year ago versus forecasts of a 4.1% drop at the start of September. Have to admit it's getting better Sure, these may sound like subtle, incremental changes. And they are. But it's all part of a bigger trend. Analysts also expect continued improvement for earnings in the fourth quarter, with a projected profit drop of 12.7% and sales decrease of 1.2%. So Corporate America might be slowly turning the corner. Wall Street is forecasting a sizable rebound in earnings and revenue for the first half of 2021, too, with profits set to rise nearly 13% in the first quarter of next year and soar 44% in the second quarter. This earnings comeback is a big reason why stocks have skyrocketed from their March lows -- despite lingering concerns about coronavirus, worries about whether more stimulus is coming from Washington and, of course, questions about the upcoming presidential election (and how long it may take until a victor is declared). \"The market is taking a lot of comfort from the fact that even though we are going to get a big decline in the third quarter, it was much worse three months ago\" said Deepak Puri, chief investment officer of the Americas for Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \"We are moving in the right direction. That is the comforting factor. Economies and businesses are starting to reopen,\" he added. Puri also noted that it's encouraging to see that Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet, which make up a bulk of the S&amp;P 500, are unlikely to suffer much of a hit to sales and profits. In addition, earnings are starting to improve for companies in cyclical sectors that were hardest hit during the early part of the spring slump, such as industrials, materials and energy. Still, there are many wild cards in play that could wreak havoc on earnings going forward. Could a Joe Biden win over President Trump lead to higher taxes and more regulations on banks? Possibly. A second wave of Covid-19 cases in America also could cripple earnings growth and the broader economy. That's why Puri concedes that investors have to take current forecasts with a grain of salt. \"Estimates could go higher in 2021 due to expectations for a fast recovery. But the outlook is highly uncertain,\" he said. \"Reality almost never syncs up with the early estimates from analysts.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p>The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p>Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p>Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p>That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p>In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p>And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p>Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p>And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p>KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p>By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p>But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p>That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p>This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p>The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p>So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p>What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p>Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p>So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p>Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p>But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p>I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p>And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p>So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p>Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p>As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p>So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p>Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p>So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p>So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p>I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p>They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p>We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p>And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p>A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p>But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p>So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p>Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p>In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p>Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p>Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p>But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p>KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p>I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p>ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p>ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p>ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p>And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p>And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p>They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p>Joining us now is --</p><p>SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p>What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p>This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p>So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p>Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p>401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p>And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p>And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p>So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p>And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p>Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p>ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p>If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p>XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p>Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p>The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p>The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p>A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p>PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p>Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p>The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p>If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p>And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p>But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p>THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p>There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p>We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p>Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p>And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p>Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p>MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p>TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p>JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p>TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.

Good to see you.  Good to see you, my man.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Loving it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're trying to rock out -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Rocking out on this Friday morning.  I mean especially with  technology killing it.  I mean think about this.  As your sales up 90  percent for Microsoft, Microsoft Office 365 -- revenues up 42 percent.   Technology is 23 percent of the overall markets so it's going to lead --  it's led it higher during the year.  It's going to lead it higher going  into the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen, Mr. Kelly.  Amen.  Coming up this morning New York Stock  Exchange President Tom Farley talks to Maria; Softbank investment adviser  CEO Rajeev Misra; and Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel; actor and director  Kevin Sorbo along with his wife Sam Sorbo.  You don't want to miss any of  those guests.</p><p>To our top story this hour however -- investors looking to earnings this  morning.  Colgate reporting just moments ago.  Earnings per share in line  with estimates at 73 cents; revenue beating expectations at $3.94 billion.   Investors also waiting on the first reading on how fast the economy was  growing last quarter.</p><p>This following the passage of the House budget vote yesterday, a key step  in paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>Joining us now, global economics editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Jon  Hilsenrath.  Jon -- what do you want to start with because earnings are -- </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How about  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- coming in better than expected but again -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- do, does Wall Street -- do investors need that tax reform to  really keep pushing stocks higher here?  Well, I mean I think they're going  to get some kind of tax reform.  We had -- the House passed the budget  yesterday.  That's another step towards completion.</p><p>They have a very aggressive timetable they are setting out in the House to  have a bill done by Thanksgiving.  I mean it's very ambitious but it looks  like they're moving in that direction.</p><p>I think really that's just whipped cream on top of the sundae at this point  because the earnings numbers are so good.  And as you said in your lead up,  you know, we're going to be getting economic growth numbers out tomorrow  and I think they're going to come in pretty strong as well.  We're looking  for something a little bit south of 3 percent; that's after 3.1 percent in  the second quarter.</p><p>The economy is doing pretty well right now.  It isn't gangbusters but it  sure is enough to keep the stock market going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's keeping it going?  Despite -- other than regulatory  reform out of the Trump administration, despite not move by Congress to  really tackle some major issues for the economy namely Obamacare and tax  cuts, tax reform.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, sometimes I think we put too much emphasis on  what's going on in Washington when things are going poorly and when things  are going well.</p><p>Right now, it's the whole world.  What we have is a very unusual  synchronized global upturn.  The European economy has just -- has started  turning up again after spending most of the last decade in a funk.</p><p>The Japanese economy is turning up too -- up again.  You know, we talk to  people there who say their equipment sales are rising because they're  selling more into the United States.</p><p>Emerging markets are picking up.  We have really a sweet spot in the global  economy and big multinational American companies like the tech guys who  reported yesterday are benefiting from it.</p><p>KELLY:  Jon -- are you concerned about the dollar though and the strength  of it?  And should we get higher interest rates going forward?  I mean  you've seen the 10-year tick up.  It's Kevin, by the way.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Are you worried about this global story that you are talking about.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think in a moment like this when the dollar  is strong you have to say -- you have to ask why is it strong?  You know,  why is it picking up?</p><p>We have the dollar picking up because the U.S. economy is in good shape and  because earnings for American companies are there.  So that's good news.   You know, does that, you know, maybe tone down the benefits to the export  sector, yes a little bit.</p><p>But when the global economy is doing well our exporters are going to do  well, too.  So I don't think a strong dollar is a sign of weakness in a  moment like this.  I think it's a sign of strength.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, I want to move on to the Federal Reserve.  I make a list  every morning of things that I think are important to talk about.  And I  made a list and it was earnings and it was the Federal Reserve chief.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump is looking to choose a new Fed chair potentially  when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.  Fox Business' Lou Dobbs sat  down with the President to discuss the candidates.  Watch this and I want  your reaction.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do you have a preference,  out of curiosity.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST:  I do and -- </p><p>TRUMP:  Tell me who your preference is.  I only want that from people I  respect.</p><p>DOBBS:  I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I'll tell you what.  She was in my office three days ago.  She's  very impressive.  I like her a lot.</p><p>In one way I have to say you like to make your own mark.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>TRUMP:  You understand that.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  You like to make your own mark which is maybe one of the things  she's got a little bit against her.  But I think she's terrific.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon -- you've covered the Federal Reserve for years.  You were  the man on the fed that everybody had to listen to.  What do you think?  Do  you have any sense of who the new Fed chief will be?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we spend so much time in the office right now  trying to figure out what's going on inside of Donald Trump's head.</p><p>You know, when you look at clips like when I hear it, I wasn't looking at  it, but when I hear it he sounds like he is very impressed with Janet  Yellen.  And you've got to ask yourself, why would he change horses in the  middle of the race that he's winning right now when growth is picking up,  unemployment is down, stock prices are at record highs.</p><p>But at the same time is he said in that clip with Lou, you know, there  seems to be some desire in the President's head and also inside the White  House to put his own mark on the place, to find his own person.</p><p>So I think -- I think he is really struggling -- not struggling but I think  he is really thinking carefully through this choice and through the pros  and cons of whether to keep her or whether to let her go.  He certainly -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Jon -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- is giving her a close look.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The conventional wisdom is if John Taylor is the next of Fed  chief that he's going to be more aggressive at raising interest rates. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump is a real estate guy.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody in real estate doesn't really like higher interest  rates.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's very fixated on the performance of the stock market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is one reason why I think we've been hammering possible  changes to 401(k) plans.  That's why it resonated with him. He's like why  are you going to mess with something that could cause the market to tank?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>And that brings you back to Janet Yellen.  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The compromise candidate for him is Jay Powell, a governor at  the Fed right now who's basically been right at Janet Yellen's side with  every decision that she's made, you know.</p><p>So you've got to -- you've got to believe that if he picks Jay Powell, he's  getting a Republican.  He's also getting someone who is going to keep  interest rates relatively low.  But then that bring you back to the  question of well, if he's going to bring someone's who's going to look like  Janet Yellen in the policies that he pursues why not just bring back Janet  Yellen?</p><p>You know, we're going to know within the next week.  They say he's going to  make a decision before he leaves for Asia next week.  So we can stop having  this conversation and start talking about whether he made a good decision  or a bad decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon -- good to see you as always.  Jon Hilsenrath -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Sure thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- I love how you said that like you're sitting in the \"Wall  Street Journal\" Washington bureau talking about what's in President Trump's  head.  Don't we all?</p><p>Actually, you know what -- usually -- thank you Jon.  Thinking of that we  don't really need to guess because he will tell -- President Trump will  tell you what's in his head.</p><p>And he just tweeted.  \"Wacky and totally unhinged Tom Steyer who has been  fighting me and my make America great again agenda from the beginning never  wins elections.\"</p><p>For background Steyer is a billionaire who is spending $10 million on a  national ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.  There you  have it.</p><p>More from the President I'm sure on Twitter and we'll bring you that as  soon as it happens.</p><p>Still ahead shedding new light on the shot heard around the world.   Declassified after decades -- we'll delve deeper into the newly released  files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p><p>Plus rolling back prices and rolling out robots -- how Wal-Mart is using  futuristic new technology to keep shelves stocked at dozens of stores  across the country.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news President Trump just tweeting, \"Congratulations to  Speaker Ryan, GOP leader, Steve Scalise and to the Republican Party on  budget passage yesterday.  Now the biggest tax cuts.\"</p><p>I love how he refers to it as tax cuts now.</p><p>The truth coming out -- numerous JFK assassination files have been  released.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest details -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there -- Dagen.  Good morning to  you.  A Red Bull morning here in the nation's capital when you think about  it the 2,800 documents released last night.  These are previously redacted  and classified documents.  And I apologize for all the noise as the leaf  blower goes by here a few times every morning right around the time I talk  to you.</p><p>But let me tell you what happened last night and this is actually a pretty  important story.  It's about the documents related to the assassination of  President Kennedy.</p><p>I think the real headline though would be the fact that many of the records  were withheld due to national security concerns, according to a memo from  the President.</p><p>Now, do keep this in mind.  Those documents contain raw intelligence.   That's uncorroborated and that's likely going to speculate -- or rather  fuel more speculation about the plot to kill the President.  We do learn a  lot about the frustration of FBI chief Herbert Hoover at Cuba's possible  role as well.</p><p>Let me share just a bit of a White House statement.  They talk about those  records that were not released overnight -- 2,800 documents.  Some people  would say it's just a drop in the bucket.  The remaining records will be  released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming  weeks.</p><p>The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from agencies,  directed them to minimize redactions without delay.  And this is an  important one from the CIA -- every single one of the approximately 18,000  remaining CIA records in the collection will ultimately be released with no  document withheld in full.  That is great.  That's a boon if you're a  researcher in particular. </p><p>Now that promise could shed more light about Lee Harvey Oswald, his trips  to Mexico before the assassination and, of course, the Castro regime  including U.S. efforts, by the way, to topple the communist dictator.</p><p>There are a number of days that we are keeping an eye on, Dagen, as we look  forward to the rolling release of these documents.  I want to point your  attention to April 26, 2018.  That's when we expect another big batch.  In  the meantime -- researchers rock on and see what you can find out.</p><p>Back to you with my friend in that bloody leaf blower -- got to love this  guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Leaf blowers are as frightening as chainsaws and louder.  Kevin  -- you did a great job.  It's great to see you.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House.</p><p>Still ahead -- courting Aramco -- the president of the New York Stock  Exchange sitting down with Maria at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia to talk about what they're doing to land potentially the  biggest initial public offering of all-time.</p><p>Then Instagram getting up close and personal -- the dramatic new feature  coming to the social media app.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia our own Maria  Bartiromo was able to sit down with New York Stock Exchange president Tom  Farley and get his take on everything from the Trump effect on the market  to the magnitude of the expected Saudi Aramco IPO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  And joining me right now is the president of  the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE president Tom Farley.  Tom -- it's good  to see you.</p><p>TOM FARLEY, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's great to be back with  you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARLEY:  -- in this beautiful hall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The hall in Saudi Arabia.  It's really incredible to me how  many people in investment management, business people are here in Saudi  this week.</p><p>FARLEY:  Yes.  I mean I was just waiting to sit down with you and impromptu  was able to have a conversation with Secretary Mnuchin, Steve Schwarzman,  Howard Marks.  And it is the great and the good of financing and finance  all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, one of the big reasons obviously is this Saudi  Aramco deal.  They are going to take their state oil company public --  could be the biggest IPO ever.  It could be up to $75 billion.</p><p>You have Alibaba which is what -- a $24 billion deal.  This would be a huge  piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>FARLEY:  So, you know, people see me in the halls here as the head of the  New York Stock Exchange.  Everyone assumes that my relationship is totally  about the Aramco IPO.  I've actually known the -- from the minister level  to the company Saudi Aramco -- I've known the company for many years long  before the IPO was even a notion because as you know the New York Stock  Exchange is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the largest energy exchange  in the world.  I'm one of the managers of that business and Saudi Aramco is  a partner and a customer in that respect.</p><p>Regarding the IPO, we will compete for any IPO of a great global business.   I can't say too much about Saudi Aramco in particular other than anyone you  meet from the company or the ministry -- and I know you've met several of  them just this week.  They are professional.  They are sophisticated.  And  no surprise, they are carrying out a very disciplined, due diligence  process to make the right decision for Saudi Arabia as a whole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think you're going to get the deal.</p><p>FARLEY:  I'm not going to comment in particular because I don't want to  prejudice any decision that they make.  But for any great global IPO, look,  first of all we want them to make the right decision for them.  We won't  try to corner them in to make something we think is a wrong decision.</p><p>Clearly the New York Stock Exchange is the leading exchange in the world  for listings.  We have something like $34 trillion of market caps.  The  next closest exchange is a tiny, tiny fraction of that.</p><p>And so in terms of the deepest liquidity in the world that's in the United  States.  Brand name -- you get that from the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  also a rigorous governance test to be listed in the New York Stock  Exchange.  So if you list there, you're holding yourself out to be a very  well-run, well-governed company.</p><p>That is kind of the decision criteria that benefits what the New York Stock  Exchange brings.  But I have no doubt other exchanges around the world have  their own unique benefits as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the implications of such a huge deal?  I mean if  you're looking at Alibaba being the biggest deal at $24 billion and this  deal is as high as $75 billion, give us a sense.  Give our viewers a sense  of why this is so important and what the global implications are for a  company this size to go public or to sell 5 percent of it to the public?</p><p>FARLEY:  So large IPOs are nerve-racking.  We do them a lot.  Of the top 20  IPOs of all time, I think the number is 13 have been on the New York Stock  Exchange.  And even those companies that fall on the other seven many of  them have ultimately listed in the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>We know a lot about big deals and the New York Stock Exchange is purpose- built for those big deals.  We combine humans and technology but we still  spend a lot of time getting ready for those IPOs because there is a lot of  bids and offers that come in that.  There's a lot of complexity on that  moment the stock opens.  And you need to make sure that stock opens  smoothly so that the management team of the IPO doesn't spend the next six  months or two years explaining what went wrong on IPO day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you what you're seeing right now at the New York  Stock Exchange in terms of listings.  Obviously there has always been a  massive competition between NYSE and Nasdaq.  What can you tell us in terms  of business year-to-date?</p><p>FARLEY:  Well, apropos of our interview location halfway around the world  from our normal home base, our shared home base it's a very global story.   The IPO market is booming in the U.S. and at the New York Stock Exchange.   We've had twice as many roundabouts, twice as many IPOs as all of last  year.  We've had this year twice as much in terms of dollar value and from  all around the world.</p><p>Last week alone we had a great company from Southeast Asia and we had  another company from China.  This week we have an Argentinian company, next  week a Brazilian company.  And so we are seeing great global companies  choosing the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing more global companies relative to the U.S.?   Because the truth is there are a lot of start-ups who are saying, you know  what, I don't want to go public.  The regulatory environment is too tight.   And I'm not going to.</p><p>So that's why there was a problem.  People were wondering why the IPO  market was not so busy earlier this year.  The start-ups were not going  public.  </p><p>FARLEY:  I'm glad you asked that.  You know, the American audience likes to  make a big deal out of a story.  There are not as many American tech  companies going public.  And that's true.  Some of the great American tech  companies have chosen to stay private.</p><p>The last week alone, we had a young man who started a company three years  ago to provide a technology that allows for consumer lending in China --  that company is now worth over $10 billion.  It's an amazing tech story.   And the Friday company, too was a technology company that offers gaming, e- commerce and payments from Singapore.  We just don't talk about it as much  frankly because it's not American.</p><p>But these are great tech companies choosing to go public, choosing the New  York Stock Exchange fortunately.  I'm appreciative that they did choose the  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here is a stat for you -- listed public companies in the  U.S. down 50 percent over 20 years because of the regulatory environment.   I mean the President has said he is calling for IPOs, the bar for IPOs to  be lowered.  </p><p>The Treasury came out with a report. They're basically saying the  regulatory environment is way too hard for companies to go public.</p><p>What are you doing in terms of lowering the bar, in terms of lowering the  standards, making it easier for companies to go public?</p><p>FARLEY:  You know, I think you are referring to our press report that came  out.  And if you work your way down that press report the next paragraph  starts with some of the efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and I  personally have engaged in, to push the administration to make it easier to  engage in IPOs.</p><p>You mentioned the number of public companies.  It is down by about half.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  But the average market cap is up by over three times -- The  aggregate market cap.  So the average company is five or six times bigger.   The public market works great for big companies.  It's not working as well  for small companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p>FARLEY:  And we need to acknowledge that because small companies are the  life blood of free enterprise.  They give the inspiration to even smaller  companies.  They create jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what can you do?  What can you do to get more small  companies to go public then?</p><p>FARLEY:  Simple things.  The pendulum has swung too far on regulation with  Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Big companies can handle it.  Small  companies can't.  So if you can allow the small companies during the IPO  process to meet more with investors and analysts, you can reduce the  Sarbanes-Oxley requirements on small companies.</p><p>Like for example, not require an external audit for the first few years  that a company is public.  And you could extend that to all new companies  not just the tiniest ones but expand the envelope a little bit and have it  be for all new companies that are new to public market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean one thing is create a longer window of time in  which companies can be in the emerging growth category.</p><p>FARLEY:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  Exactly.  And what that emerging market growth category does is it  just requires less regulation for small companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  You know, regulation is like taxes.  No regulation isn't the  answer and complete government control isn't the answer -- somewhere in  between is the right answer, and the pendulum is going to swing.  We have  swung too far towards heavily regulating small companies and we need to  swing it back aggressively to make sure that that IPO engine is there for  those young entrepreneurs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the sentiment feel like to you when you go down on  the floor, when you speak to big investors?  Because how do you like the  way the President is constantly tweeting that market has gained $5.3  trillion in market value since Election Day?  We are at record highs --  23000 and counting.</p><p>Do you feel like things are getting overheated?  Do you feel the same  sentiment when you talk to investors that you did a year ago?</p><p>FARLEY:  I walk in on the floor and I look up at the indices every morning  and it's amazing what has happened since November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't you think?</p><p>FARLEY:  We're 17400 that night, if you remember because the indices really  cratered and now they had zipped back up.  However I will note, it's also a  global story.  This isn't just America.  In the last two weeks alone the  DAX, the CAC, the (INAUDIBLE) -- they have all hit all-time highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>FARLEY:  So there is a really -- this is a really good moment globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you feel like sentiment is still there?  The bullishness  or are people getting worried that things are getting over priced?</p><p>FARLEY:  People are bullish.  That doesn't mean there won't be a pullback  but people are bullish without question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Tom -- it's great to see  you.</p><p>FARLEY:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FARLEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Farley is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up rebuilding Puerto Rico -- 80 percent of the island is  still without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

The futuristic new  tech coming to Walmart to ensure that shelves are always stocked.</p><p>To our stop story this half hour.  The crisis in Puerto Rico.  Two house  committees and a federal watchdog are now investigating the $300 million  no-bid contract that was awarded to Whitefish Energy holdings to repair  Puerto Rico's flattened electrical grid.</p><p>Critics say Whitefish has little experience repairing electricity  infrastructure.  And alleged the company has ties to interior secretary,  Ryan Zinke.</p><p>Joining us now is the spokesman of Whitefish Energy Holdings, Ken Luce.   Ken, what do you say to these investigations?  Are they warranted?</p><p>KEN LUCE, SPOKESMAN, WHITEFISH ENERGY HOLDINGS:  No.  The investigations  are not warranted.  First off, PREPA hired a firm Whitefish Energy who has  extensive experience fixing transmission lines, especially in the  mountains, which is our assignment.  Our assignment is 100 miles of  transmission lines mostly in the mountains of Puerto Rico, which are  necessary to restore the power ultimately overtime.</p><p>The real issue congress should be asking is where are the other firms that  the core and CORE and FEMA are hiring to come to the island to help repair  the grid?  Those contracts were just let last week.  Meaning, it's another  two or three weeks before more help us to the island.  That's the  frustration in Puerto Rico is the resources are not there yet.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And part of the controversy is that  Whitefish only had two full-time employees as reported when Maria hit  Puerto Rico on September 20th and then since hired all these employees.</p><p>You have a pretty robust experience in PR.  When did the company hire you?</p><p>LUCE:  The company hired us two ago.  But again, the point here is the  entire industry ramps up when you get contracts.  Whitefish has experience  in the mountains which is why we were hired.</p><p>If you have a question about that, and the business practice of ramping up  much like homebuilders, consulting firms and others do, look at the results  to date.  320 people are already on the island, lineman and engineers,  repairing the grid.  So if there's a question, then look at the facts.</p><p>My real issue is no one has asked the questions and then reported the  facts.  There's just this jump to say nothing's being done which is  inaccurate.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  What are the facts that you think aren't being reported?</p><p>LUCE:  Well, I mean, the fact you have two employees and you have a  business model that ramps up just like hundreds of firms in the United  States and all over the world.  And you now have 320 employees.</p><p>So if you question a two-person firm with the ability, look at their  experience which is working in mountainous regions and the CEO is leading  that effort in Puerto Rico today and we have 320 people on the ground in  less than three weeks.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Ken.  Erin Elmore here.   There were also allegations -- </p><p>LUCE:  Hi.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi.  How are you?  There were also allegations that interior  secretary, Ryan Zinke's son had an internship at Whitefish.  What do you  say about that?  And is there any correlations there that are troubling?</p><p>LUCE:  No.  He did.  He was a flagger.  So he directed traffic on a summer  job through a friend.  But to say the interior secretary had anything to do  with the contract, number one, it's not true.  Everyone has said so.  He  found out about the contract after it was let.  And he also has no  authority over FEMA, the CORE, PREPA, so again there's a jump today to  guilt versus facts.</p><p>And then the other part of that is, if you really look at the political  landscape in Puerto Rico, an interior secretary and the current  administration would not necessarily be popular in Puerto Rico where the  majority of the population supported the other party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Jen, these investigations aren't going away or at least  inquiries, two health committees, a federal watchdog investigating the  contract, the $300 million, no bid contract.  The governor of Puerto Rico  Rossello, says his administration will soon audit the contract awarded to  Whitefish.  And there's a retired air force colonel appointed to oversee  the reconstruction of the electoral grid following concerns over this very  contract.</p><p>So a lot of eyes on Whitefish now.</p><p>LUCE:  And again, we, welcome them.  Every member of congress should have  the information that they're asking for.  And we will certainly give that  out, but the first thing is, there were no questions asked.  Everybody  jumped to a conclusion based on the \"Washington Post\" article and no one  called.  We reached out to offices before this happened and said, if you  want information, we're more than happy to give it to you.</p><p>The contract with PREPA was done correctly.  PREPA has a company working on  the island and the current administration does not had those resources  there yet.  We welcome it and at the end, I'm just hoping people report  that there was nothing there.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, the director of Puerto Rico's power company has been  quoted saying that part of the reason that Whitefish was selected as the  only company that didn't require a down payment.</p><p>So I wanted to ask.  This does require a lot of money.  So, how well and  how was -- hos is Whitefish finance for this?</p><p>LUCE:  Well, Whitefish is very well capitalized.  They had financing from  several private equity firms.  They have met all their obligations to date.</p><p>But let me go back.  There was a very small deposit.  It was $2 million, I  believe.  There were another firm that also wanted to work, but required 10  to 15 times that amount to begin to work.</p><p>So capitalization isn't an issue.  We have 300 people working on the  island.  We have barges coming over every day.  We're trying to get our  equipment through the ports so that more men and women can come to work and  help Puerto Rico.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ken, thank you so much for being here.  Ken Luce, representing  Whitefish.</p><p>LUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  We'll see you soon.</p><p>Walmart bots roll out.

Here is from the  president.  \"JFK files are being carefully released and there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to public.\"</p><p>It's not going to stop the conspiracy theory.  It was only -- all these  documents are only going to make people lose their minds.</p><p>Meantime, the FBI is set to give congress documents related to the  controversial Russian dossier that we now know the democrats and the in the  Hillary Clinton were behind.  Cheryl Casone has that story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  About that right, Dagen?  House Speaker, Paul Ryan says the  FBI has agreed to provide documents long stopped by congress in a variety  of investigations including information about a 35-page research document  containing unverified allegations about President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, U.S. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The FBI got in  touch with us yesterday afternoon and they has -- they have informed us  that they will comply with our document requests and that they will provide  the documents congress has been asking for by next week and we expect the  FBI to honor that commitment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that both Clinton campaign chairman  John Podesta and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denied to  congressional investigators that they had any knowledge about who paid for  the dossier.  That testimony could put them in hot water, as it came a week  before it was revealed that in fact democrats had paid for part of it.</p><p>Podesta and Schultz could face perjury charges if it turns out they gave  false statements to congress.</p><p>OK.

Cleveland Police say they saw the boy's car speed by, chased by another car  possibly driven his mother.</p><p>The 15-mile chase lasted less than an hour.  It finally ended after a  trooper was able to nudge the car into that sign, as you can see here with  his cruiser.  The kid was boxed in.  The kid was taken into custody.   Police say this same little boy stole his mother's Dodge Charger for a spin  and went down Interstate 90 earlier this month.

And I think we should point out it's just  a miracle that nobody was hurt whether, it's the kid or a passenger in  another car, a driver in another car.  I want to point that out.</p><p>But in terms of this Instagram feature, Erin just changed my life when she  told me about this.  An app.  It's called YouCam Perfect.  It basically  edits your face.

Actor and director, Kevin Sorbo joining  us with his wife Sam Sorbo, to talk about their new movie shining a light  on the crisis of faith.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hollywood sexual harassment secrets revealed.  Our next guests,  \"Hercules\" actor, Kevin Sorbo, says he too was a victim.  Joining us now is  Kevin and his actress wife, Sam.  They're here to talk about their new  movie.</p><p>But, first, I wanted to talk about -- because you have come out and said  that you -- that Gianni Versace hit on him.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO, AMERICAN ACTOR:  In my book and it happened years ago.  It's  already in my book.  It's not like a secret.  I didn't suffer any trauma  from it but I'm not taking with the people who have, because it's out  there.  Look at them.  I'm a big dude.  Most people in Hollywood aren't  going to -- they're not going to kid on me.  They're afraid of me.</p><p>The most male actors are five-eight.  I'm a big guy.</p><p>SAM SORBO, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  What's amazing is to see now this sorted --  the sorted underbelly of Hollywood coming out.  And we have a film that's  coming out tonight and it's almost the antisepsis of that, right?  Produced  outside of Hollywood with Sean Hannity, as you know.  Not funded by  Hollywood at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fox News Channel, so he -- we have to disclose that.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  He's on the Fox News Channel.  No, it's true and so we're kind  of excited that -- because this film takes a different one.  This is the --  this is the film that Hollywood used to produce.  The uplifting film.  The  film with Godly character.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Prior to the '60s, Hollywood produced, character-driven  movies.  And now, it's changed.  They celebrate antihero.  They celebrate  sort of the negativity in life.  It's just weird to me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think it's a stretch to say this that with Hollywood and  people in that industry broadly speaking that there's a disconnect between  individual and family and faith.</p><p>And that that -- it is largely an industry that is if they don't -- faith  is not front and center if people go to church regularly.  And so, do you  think that that opened the door for greater sexual harassment over decades?   And I'm not naming any individual.  But it's a lack connection to God and  higher power.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  It's actually -- it's a different face.  OK.  If you think of  it as a non-faith -- </p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Every movie is faith-based movie.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  Their face is different.  They put faith in Darwinism and  evolution and survival of the fittest, which is what Harvey Weinstein did.   Survival of the fittest.  He took what he wanted and he got it.  And  sometimes they made him pay for it and he was cool with that.  And it was  business as usual and everybody who knew about it was perfectly fine with  it.  It's a completely different face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You worship at the altar of filth.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Yes.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  And so in our movie, we juxtapose the two, right?  We have two  people who are grieving and one of them worships at the altar of self.   He's basically an egomaniac.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  That's my character.  Yes, he's not a very good guy.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  And his ex-wife.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  But he's a lost man.  He's lost.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  He's lost.  And an ex-wife who is faithful and goes to church  and is raising their two boys in the Christian faith.  And so we juxtapose  the two.  And you can walk it alone or you can walk it with higher power  and you see the difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to watch this clip:  \"Let There Be Light.\"  Opens  nationwide today.  Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM SORBO:  What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of  their brother and using his part of your carnival act?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  It pays the bills.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Daddy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clinically dead in entrance for four minutes.  It's a  miracle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's incredible.  And you wrote it, Sam.  You co-wrote the  script.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  I co-wrote it with Dan Gordon who's a very well-known Hollywood  screenwriter and I was -- I was lucky that he jumped right on board when he  heard the idea.  And then two weeks later, out of the blue Sean calls Kevin  and says.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Sean gave me a call and says, hey, I want to do movie with  you.  I love your got -- what soul-searching movie.  And I said, we got  one.  And we included in the arc and boom.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to put you on the spot.  Is this your favorite project  you've ever worked on?  Especially you work with your wife and she co-wrote  it?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Well, there's questions, one of my favorite ones.  It's in  the top five.  I've done between Hercules and a drama and then -- and then  54 movies.  I've done a lot of work.</p><p>I mean, but I'm very fortunate that I'm still working, because certainly  coming out of the conservative Christian closet in Hollywood for an  industry this of tolerance and freedom of speech, it's pretty much a one- way street with them.  So I've been very lucky to keep working.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  People can go to lettherebelightmovie.com.  They can find out  what theaters it's playing.  And if it's not playing in the theater near  you, I urge people to go, call the theaters or go to the website and  organize group tickets.</p><p>We found that there's a little bit of a threshold, higher thresholds for  faith-based films being booked into theaters.  If they're looking for some  sort of proof, some sort of presales and stuff, that they don't typically  look for in non-faith movies -- </p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Well, that's kind of typical for small independent movies.   It really is that way, if you don't have a big budget to promote.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  The idea with movies is, movies are storytelling.  They shape  the culture.  Hollywood shapes our culture.  Do we want the culture of  Hollywood to trickle down into this culture?  Do we want the culture of  Harvey Weinstein to be pervasive in the U.S. culture?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Kevin.  Are you finding though that people are more  receptive to conservative, more receptive to people who are kind of wear  their faith on the outside as a lot of people and other parts of the  Hollywood?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Let me tell you something.  I travel a lot.  One to airports.   Wherever I'm on streets, cities, no matter where I am, people walk up to me  now, not because of \"Hercules\" and drama, they walk to me because of  (INAUDIBLE) please make more movies like this.</p><p>So if they want to see more movies like this, they have to support them,  because like I said, we don't have the big budget to bring these out there.   And movies like this become successful because of word-of-mouth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam and Kevin Sorbo and you can see -- I'm on \"Outnumbered\"  today.  I'm lucky, guys.  So I'll be very nice.  I promise.  Thank you both  so much.</p><p>Still ahead, exed out.  Apple's iPhone 10 selling out already.  Presales  started earlier today.  When can you get it and how much will you pay?

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Earnings extravaganza, big names including Merck, ExxonMobil,  Chevron, all reporting this morning.  This comes after stellar, earnings  yesterday afternoon from tech giants, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent  Alphabet all delivering better-than-expected results.  Amazon shares  jumping on the news, CEO Jeff Bezos made about $6 billion extra on that  move.  Not the only good news for that retailer, the company gaining  wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states.  The part of driving force  behind CVS making a deal to buy health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66  billion.</p><p>The futures are showing begins across the board this morning.  We have a  32-point gain on the Dow futures, held higher by Microsoft stock again on  those positive earnings and also Intel, two Dow components.  We have gains  across the board.  Later this hour we get the first reading on fast U.S.  economy was growing in the third quarter.  The first reading on third- quarter GDP.  Investors also eyeing key developments out of Washington  including the House passing a budget and we have Exxon earnings coming in  right now.  Looking double beat, 66.17 billion on the revenue line and then  also earnings per share coming in higher as well.  93 cents a share on  Exxon versus an estimate of 86 cents a share.  So, a double beat on Exxon  and, again, those earnings growth in the energy sector from a year ago  gangbusters, so up triple-digit gains on earnings there.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump tweeting on the matter this morning saying, I'll  be talking about the House budget.  Congratulations to Speaker Ryan, GOP  Leader Steve Scalise and Republican Party on budget passage yesterday, now  the biggest tax cuts.  Moving on to new details behind the JFK  assassination, the White House allowing the release of thousands of  previously blocked records, the staggering revelation including a possible  warning nearly 30 minutes ahead of the tragedy.  And iPhone lovers braving  their early morning hours to order the iPhone 10.  The latest as preorders  for the highly-anticipated device go up online.  And Apple needs a winner  because those iPhone 8 sales, the slowest for a new device in years.  </p><p>The greatest of all time taking the wheel, the staggering amount it will  cost you to drive a special edition Aston-Martin designed by really?   Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.  That's right.  What can the man not do?   I'm joking.  And here with me to break it all down, Fox News Correspondent  Lea Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate, Erin Elmore.  Lovely to  be with you.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  I just want to say the Aston-Martin  comes with fully inflated tires.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh, hey yow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get down.</p><p>KELLY:  That's right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the wife in the -- in the passenger seat nagging.  His wife  rather.</p><p>KELLY:  Does she nag?  I haven't heard her say a word ever.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Nag.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  The one thing we didn't say is that Stephanie Pomboy is going to be  here and she is one of our favorite economists especially when it comes to  GDP and she will give coverage and read-throughs that no one else has on  the streets.  She's my favorite person when she comes in.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, you see, here is how it goes every morning since she do  the short show almost like two times a week.  We introduce the panel, and  then we promo the guests.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you just stepped on my promo.</p><p>KELLY:  I know, I know.  But I'm just so excited. </p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I thought I was just sober for coming  on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So he just -- so Kevin just stepped on this promo but we do have  SoftBank investment, Rajeev Misra coming up, SoftBank adviser/CEO, Maria  talked to him yesterday.  Sam Paschel, Zero Motorcycle CEO and \"VARNEY AND  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Don't miss -- and Stephanie Pomboy at the  bottom of the hour.  But busy earning season continues with two big oil  companies reporting.  We just had Exxon earnings hitting the tape, earnings  per share of 93 cents topping expectations.  Revenue also a beat.  Kevin  Kelly, your thoughts on the energy sector because again, this is huge surge  in earnings off the bottom a year -- near the bottom a year ago.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And that highlights the effect of what's really driving the  earning season this year because the energy sector was so depressed when  you think about where oil was even a year ago.  You had 25, 30, $35.00,  $45.00 a barrel of oil.  Now we stayed now consistently above 50 but that  hasn't played through yet.  So one of the interesting aspects is we're  going to want to see what guidance is going forward.  Investors are solely  focused on the effects of the hurricanes that are going to be in Chevron as  well as the Exxon.  What they see going forward where they are in terms of  cost cuts, that's been a very, very big focus for them because a lot of  times, the cost of oil a barrel is higher for a lot of these integrated  when you're thinking Exxon, Chevron, right?  So they're in -- they're all  over the globe, and so because there has been a depression of prices  globally that's affecting them, the last thing is also what they're going  to do M&amp;A wise.  People are worried that they need to start buying  companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory backdrop because we always focus on  Washington and what the Congress hasn't done on health care and taxes but  in terms of the regulation rollback that is something the Trump  administration has been on top of and that does particularly help energy  companies.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  That really helps energy companies and they've even spoken  about that on their investor and conference call all year long.  They're  waiting for actually even more deregulation to happen in the space  especially for them to deploy more of their capital because we've seen coal  as actually done really well this year and the supplies are up and people  are using it more especially with renewable energies and a lot of tax  credits that are flowing through on there.  So a lot -- a lot of policy  coming out of Washington is going to dictate what happens to these  companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google on track  for record highs today.  Amazon stock also getting a boost; Microsoft and  Intel really pushing up the Dow futures this morning.  You look at these  stocks go and Amazon on the news that not just earnings but Amazon is  getting into the pharmacy business or it's gotten approval for wholesale  pharmacy licenses and at least dozens stays.  This comes as the Wall Street  Journal, Kevin, is reporting that giant drugstore chain CVS is in talks to  buy the third largest insurer in the country.  Aetna for $66 billion.  This  CVS deal is in direct response to Amazon, is that right?  What other kinds  of deals could we be looking at in response to Amazon's move into more and  more businesses?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And this really is a shot across the bow because if you think  about what did Amazon do that was of the most significant recently, they  bought Whole Foods, right?  So with getting the state licenses, with  pharmacies can they start distributing -- basically prescription drugs  through their whole partnership and logistics with Whole Foods.  So you see  CVS actually now striking out and looking to do a deal with Aetna and  insurer which they have no experience in.  So this is actually pretty  telling.  We're going to see this story play out over the next couple  quarters, not years.  There is going to be a lot of activity and we're  going to get a lot of activity and we're going to get a lot of direction  that's coming through on that.  And you can see, Amazon is fighting, Wal- Mart toe-to-toe and especially when in the next leg of fight with them is  in the -- is in the prescription drug business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is a huge business.</p><p>ELMORE:  Prices can come way down.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are some drug packages like with Medicare prescription  drug packages packages, the part D that you can only buy prescriptions at  like major pharmacy like you aren't able and allowed to go and buy -- get  prescriptions at smaller like local pharmacy.  You literally have to.   Where I'm from you have to go to Wal-Mart.  It's the only place you can go.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  And the Whole -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again trying to break up that juggernaut.</p><p>KELLY:  And Amazon's idea behind this is the description model.  So people  don't need to continuously go to the pharmacy if they have a physical  presence and then they can get that subscription.  They'll figure out the  delivery and like I said, with their logistic systems that they do have  with Whole Foods.</p><p>ELMORE:  And the delivery is a great idea for people that are homebound or  wheelchair bound, things like that, it's also helping that market, they  really can't help themselves, so I think that's really nice for us people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with this CVS acquisition of Aetna in terms of what it could  potentially do expanding, basically giving a huge number of new customers  through Aetna for its pharmacy benefit management business bolstering its  leverage in negotiation for drug with drug makers in terms of pricing power  and then also you strike deals with -- to tie drug prices to patient  outcomes which is also incredible.  I want to move on to Washington, this  time, it's about truth coming out of D.C.  Numerous JFL assassination filed  released.  Blake Burman is at the White House with the very latest.  Blake,  good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  And this was nearly 2900 additional documents relating to  President Kennedy and his assassination that were produce last night by the  National Archives, not all the documents though within this last batch  though were put forward as the president said in a memo that \"Certain  information should continue to be redacted because of national security,  law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.\"  These newest documents  though do shed more details about the events surrounding the assassination  of JFK.  For example, one shows that a British reporter received a phone  call about 25 minutes before President Kennedy was shot and was told that  there would be impending \"Big news.\"  </p><p>Another detail show an FBI source then claimed days later that the Soviet  Union was fearful that a missile could head their way because of the  actions of an irresponsible U.S. general.  This final batch of the last set  of documents has to be released now by the end of April.  And President  Trump tweeted out moments ago the following, he said and I quote, \"JFK  files are being carefully released.  In the end, there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to the public.\"   For now, Dagen if you need good some good reading, you're just curious or  whatever it might be, all you have to do is head on over to National  Archives Web site, the documents are listed right there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm tempted, I am really tempted when I came out I was  (INAUDIBLE)I got other stuff I need to read.  So yes, weekend reading.   Thank you so much --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN:  It will be there for a while.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  Great to see you as always.   Preorders for the iPhone selling out in just minutes, overnight.  What it  means for anyone trying to get their hands on this hot device.  The release  date is technically November the 3rd but what if you need it before  Christmas or the holidays?  And nobody can drive down the field like Tom  Brady but at least you can drive down the road like the Patriots superstar.   The hot new ride from Aston-martin inspired by the greatest of all time.</p><p>KELLY:  Not.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Preorders for the Apple 10 iPhone starting today but you might  have trouble getting yours in.  Cheryl Casone has more details on this.   Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Hey, Dagen.  Sources saying supplies of the hot  new phone are sold out, shipping estimates slipping well beyond the  November 3rd launch date here in the U.S. on Apple's Web site five to six  weeks right now.  According to one report by the way out in Hong Kong,  they're sold out online with both models of the iPhone 10 currently  unavailable.  That's in that country.  The phone apparently also sold out  on Apple's Web site over in the U.K.  Now this news coming on weak sales of  the iPhone 8 by the way, two research firms saying the 8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  Shares of Apple trading  higher in the premarket higher by more than one percent.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco, Kiko  Alonso nails it, knocks off Flacco's helmet.  And then huge fight ensues  after the hit.  Alonso was given the unnecessary roughest penalty, Alonso  crushing Flacco as he goes for the (INAUDIBLE) Flacco would go straight  into the locker room with a concussion and he would not return to the game.</p><p>Well, let's stay with some football here.  Tom Brady has got a pretty cool  new ride, Aston-Martin selling a special Tom Brady signature edition car.   The luxury convertible for $360,000.  The British sports car usually  associated with 007, it's now going T.V. 12.  Brady's signature is on the  door, on the plates, on the doors, on the T.V. 12 logo.  It's all over the  vehicle basically.  It's on the fender, it's on the headrest.  But if you  want one, keep in mind there's only 12 of these being made.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has launched the zombie  Frappuccino, the drink apparently inspired by an apple dips and caramel,  taste like a tart green apple we are told.  We're going to find out just a  second in our taste tester on set.  Starbucks hoping the drink is going to  -- well, catch on like the uniform Frappuccino which was a huge hit back in  April for the company.  Starbucks, the stock anyway is down about one  percent in the premarket right now.  Stock to watch.  So let's go with  these. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's the verdict?  OK.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I do think it taste like a tart green apple with caramel.  It  really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes.  It's a lot of ones.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ELMORE:  -- together and put in a blender and eat it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheryl, technically if it's a zombie Frappuccino, wouldn't it  taste like rotting flesh?</p><p>CASONE:  No.  Well, you know, you would think so, Dagen, but I don't think  that's what they're going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>KELLY:  You also like to know what rotting flesh tastes like, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p>CASONE:  The pink whipped cream is supposed to be the brains, OK?  The red  mocha drizzle is blood obviously.  It might gross you out. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  No, but, you know, by the way, you have to like kind of drink them  quick, because once they kind of -- the mixed up basically they're saying  like you -- once you order these, like don't like hold on to it because it  -- and then it gets kind of funky color.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Slurpy same thing happens. </p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.  Slurpy, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, paving the way for a public debut.  Maria, sitting  down with a top name from SoftBank to top about the timeline for a possible  Uber IPO. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you, ESPN reporting that Alibaba co- founder Joseph Tsai has reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49  percent minority stake The Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets worth $1.8 billion by  the latest valuation according to Forbes Magazine.  So, the Nets --</p><p>KELLY:  That's the Chinese and the Russians together now owning the Nets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I still not go to games.  Where can you find value in this  market?  Maria Bartiromo sat down with SoftBank investment adviser Rajeev  Misra in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where she asked him just that.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  You are $100-billion vision fund is dominating  conversations across the world, congratulations -- </p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISE, SOFTBANK:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the performance as well.  Tell us how you're allocating  capital.  Where are the growth opportunities in the world today? </p><p>MISRA:  Group opportunities are everywhere but it's concentrated with  entrepreneurial equal system exist and that's primarily in two locations,  China and U.S. If you look at our fund and we have two pools of capital in  SoftBank.  The vision fund which a hundred billion, plus SoftBank group  itself which makes a lot of technology and investment off this balance  sheet.  We own -- we bought the ARM last year, we have Sprint, and SoftBank  Mobile, we have 28 percent stake in Alibaba that also has grown in value  and so there are two pools of capital.  But almost half our investments are  going into U.S. 50 odd billion, a lot chunk will be in China where there's  a large population-based and there they are leapfrogging technology to  include a large part of the population hence from ride-sharing companies  like Didi to bicycle-sharing that go for food delivery, et cetera, et  cetera is very exciting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you.</p><p>MISRA:  No, Uber is not looking to take 10 billion from us, they will get a  billion -- a billion and one half as primary investment.  There is  potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity to shareholders and  employees who are early investors to sell secondary shares to SoftBank and  we are late-stage discussions to potentially buy some secondary shares from  early investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the valuations, is it harder today to find  value which is also a growth story?  I mean, obviously, Alibaba has been an  incredible performer for you, but when you look elsewhere, is there another  Alibaba out there?  </p><p>MISRA:  There may not be Alibaba but we make a thousand times in return but  we vested Nvidia nine months ago, we bought five percent of Nvidia for --  close to $3 billion, it's worth six billion in nine months.  So you don't  have to find just Alibaba to make good investments.  We are going through a  technology revolution as we speak in every aspect of human life, from food  delivery to life sciences to as I said insurance, to selling used cars, to  selling homes, to buy -- getting a mortgage, to so far getting us to loan,  every aspect of life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everything is the sharing economy.  </p><p>MISRA:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right? </p><p>MISRA:  So there is plenty of opportunities.  Valuation is not an issue if  you find the right companies that are market leaders, that have the right  entrepreneur and management, to scale, to go global, this is what SoftBank  helps with and we are a consumer company too.  We have 35 million  subscribers with Sprint, with 35 million subscribers in SoftBank Mobile in  Japan, et cetera.  And getting these companies to work with each other,  learning from each other, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  A ride- sharing companies in India Ola learns a lot from Didi in China from their  experiences and vice versa.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Telecom has been really critical for you.  Why is Telecom sort  of the underlying important, you know, backdrop of some of your  investments? </p><p>MISRA:  There are four factors that are shaping the technology revolution.   First, processing power, the ability to process and the cost of processing  has gone through phenomenal scale where your iPhone today can process  cheaper and faster than mainframe 15 years ago or a laptop computer 10  years ago, data, second.  Ability to collect data and able to process the  data which is driving (INAUDIBLE) in media which is called the graphic  processing unit and ability to structure large and analyze large  unstructured data pools and make sense out of it and predict outcomes and  predict consumer behavior, managing inventory and be able to analyze that  kind of data.  So data -- ability of collecting data and having access to  data is a second factor.  Processing data software to analyze it and  lastly, Telecom speed and cost of Telecom.  Look at 10 years ago, there  were no smartphones.  Smartphones came in 2007.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now can't live without them.  </p><p>MISRA:  And we can't live without them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>MISRA:  And the ability to have that kind of processing power in your car,  in your smartphone, in your house, so on.  Telecom speed is important for  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) Let me ask you about A.I. and the worry there.   People are wondering what skill set do I need to drive in this new world.   A.I. means robotics machine learning.  Are we going to have more robots  than humans?  Are they going to take human's jobs?.  </p><p>MISRA:  We already have a lot of robots, car is a robot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  True.</p><p>MISRA:  You know, a robot doesn't have to walk and speak, I mean, they're  kind of bots and robots.  A phone --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, should we be afraid of it?  </p><p>MISRA:  Not at all.  You have more -- you have robots today versus 10 years  ago.  You have all these cars that robots, your iPhone is a robot, et  cetera, et cetera.  They only would make -- enable your life a lot better.   They will provide healthcare services better, they will make your  entertainment better, you can listen to music, your wristwatch, your  tracker, but what skills the young needs to know and learn is there's so  much learn by -- you don't have to be a computer programmer to be -- to be  successful in this -- in the next generation.  You need to learn -- you  need to go to China, you need to go to India, see what -- all you need to  do is take what's successful in one part of the world and take it to  another.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Rajeev, it's great to have you on the program today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>MISRA:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The first reading on third-quarter GDP on the other  side of this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  3.0 percent, that's how fast the U.S. economy was growing, this  is the first reading on the third quarter gross domestic product, it's our  biggest measure, most important measure of how the overall U.S. economy is  doing.  The expectation was for 2-1/2 percent, they're about to get three  percent and see that nice three number in the front of GDP growth.  It is  kind of exciting if you want the U.S. to do well.  Joining us now is one of  our favorites guest of all time, MacroMavens president, Stephanie Pomboy.   Stephanie, just your initial take on this three percent reading, how is it  that we're growing at a three percent growth? </p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Wow.  Well, you know, I'm  surprised, I want to see the details in terms of the inventory contribution  versus the consumer spending because obviously what we care about is seeing  strong spending rather than just some inventory bill.  And I know that at  least the Atlanta fed and they're, therefore, had built in almost a full  percentage point contribution from inventories largely due from hurricanes  that we saw.  So that will be interesting to look at but as you know, you  know, my concern has been that there's been a broad deceleration in growth,  not that the wheels are off but that in a way it been general turning  downward this highways a little bit.  Since 2015, I've seen slowing tax  receipts, actually, treasury tax receipts are now down year and year which  is a recession reading.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>POMBOY:  So there's some things that just don't square with the strength of  the headlined numbers and I'm very interested to find out, you know, what  the details here are.  The other thing we're seeing that's a little is  disturbing kind of conflicts with the strong headline spending in GDP  numbers are the rise and the delinquencies.  So, there are couple things  out there that have me concerned and this is why I'm so anxious to see the  tax cuts come through because we need to pass this baton from monetary to  fiscal policy and get some more (INAUDIBLE) into the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think this three percent though gives Congress more --  that they think, the economy is doing OK, there is no urgency? That's my  worry.  </p><p>POMBOY:  That's the danger, exactly.  I mean, I'm -- since I'm looking at  thing like tax receipts and delinquencies and, you know, the slowing  consumer discretionary spending, I'm worried, you know, I'm sitting here  biting nails like they've got to get this done fast.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I'm glad you brought up tax receipts because I'm extremely  worried because the Fed keeps saying we haven't had inflation but they're  looking at the wrong indicators.  Look at asset inflation, it's been  unbelievable, look at health care, the price of health care has gone up  exponentially.  The price of getting a college education has gone up  significantly.  So when they're talking about the PCE and they're talking  about CPI, those are all just like, you know, areas for them to deflect.   Asset inflation they've even been worried about.  Now, do you see headwinds  coming about because now we're at -- I'm looking where recession highs for  the dollar, 10-year yields are going up.  I mean, do you see that this  could be the only two-quarter GDP for that we get that's good given the  headwinds?  </p><p>POMBOY:  Well, this is what I worry about, you know, I'm glad you talked  about the rising cost of health care intuition, housing expenses have gone  up a lot in the couple of years.  So if you strip out housing in health  care, you know, that's 40 percent of the increasing in consumer spending.   So discretionary spending as I said, you know, has been slowing and  actually, people are now relying more on credit cards and transfer payments  to, you know, cover their everyday necessities.  So I think it's a major  issue and then you've got the Fed doing Q.T. which isn't going to help in  terms of, you know, tightening credit conditions, et cetera.  So this is  why again, I come back to the urgency of really getting these tax cuts  through and getting some relief because right now, clearly the trend toward  decelerating growth notwithstanding this current GDP, the third quarter is,  you know, going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is the best six-month stretch since mid-2014 for the  economy in terms of GDP, and the commerce department said that this was  particularly interesting or strong, because of the hurricane.  We were  still able to grow at three percent for the quarter.  And this is the first  reading, it could be revised downward or upward, but, again, it was  particularly spectacular for that reason because of the weather.  </p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I think the things to watch going forward is what's  happening obviously on the consumer spending front, like you said, you  know, I think some of the data actually, the monthly data had been  surprisingly strong over that hurricane period.  We did see yesterday,  retail inventories were much weaker though when you saw auto inventories  thankfully, you know, post their largest decline since the recession and  that's sort of a silver lining of this hurricane, and you might have  provided all these producers some relief on the inventory front because  they've been dealing with very high -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, here we go.  Consumer spending gain was driven by motor  vehicles as Americans replaced cars damaged by the storms and then services  spending by contrast flow to its weakest since 2013, so that goes into your  kind of discretionary spending outside of housing and health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about inventories and --  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I'm pulling that out.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Can I ask you real quick about the  Fed and the plan to unwind balance sheets the Fed, what risk do you see in  terms of future GDP from that?  </p><p>POMBOY:  Well, I think we are credit dependent economy, you know, I always  talk about how it's the car basically, and credit is the fuel that gets it  going, and we've actually reached the point where we rely -- we're getting  worse mileage basically, we need gas in the tank go each additional GDP  mile.  So if you're to start to reduce the supply of fuel in the economy,  the credit fuel which is what the Fed is basically going to do but natural  tendency of the economy is going to be to grow with a slower rate.  And  we're already, you know, in the deceleration phase and the interesting  thing on that too is bank credits, total bank lending has already rolled  over sharply ahead of Q.T.  So, we haven't gone to see the real Fed  tightening and yet credit conditions are already starting to slow down.  So  this again, you know, just underscore why I'm really focused on the tax  cuts because, you know, we got to pass the baton from monetary to fiscal  policy, and right now, you know, it's a nail-biter.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And trading inventories added a combined 1.14 to the growth.  </p><p>POMBOY:  OK.  Yes.  It was supposed to add about .8, so that's a  substantially larger ad.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So real final sales been were one-six.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So that's not, you know, that's not from 2.9 last quarter.  That's  a pretty big slowdown.  So -- anyway, totally we'll get this tax cut.</p><p>POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) in the --</p><p>KELLY:  Real economy.</p><p>POMBOY:  In the real economy.  That would be nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stephanie, it's so good to see you always.  Because you all --  every time we talk to you, you always tell us something that we don't know  and it's just a different --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, that's my job.  I think, you know, let's focus on the stuff  these people are focused on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some people kind of tell you what you've already heard 800  times.  Not you, Stephanie Pomboy.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>POMBOY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have a great weekend.  Big oil in focus this morning as well,  Exxon and Chevron reporting earnings, both companies topping expectations.   Joining us now is price futures group senior market analyst, fox business  contributor, Mr. Phil Flynn.  Mr. Flynn, what do you see in these earnings?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  We're  putting the big back in big oil.  How about that?  I mean, these are  companies that a couple years ago were given up for dead, ExxonMobil used  to be the biggest energy company in the world, moved down to number four,  Chevron, of course, had some major problems with earnings, but what a  comeback right now, especially if you look at ExxonMobil, what an amazing  earnings quarter when you consider the fact that their entire refining  operation on Gulf Coast was under water last quarter.  </p><p>They're saying that their earnings would have been even better, you know,  four cents better if it weren't for that situation.  So we're seeing  something going on that's reflected not only in oil prices but in the GDP.   You know, sometimes this comeback in oils really reflective of what we've  been seeing in the economy and the economy that's recovering not only here  but around the globe, and that's why I'm really excited about big oil and  big earnings because that means the economy is feeling, demand for oil and  natural gas is going up, that means people are working so this is great  news for the economy today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil, great to see you as always.  Phil Flynn.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Coming up.  An electrifying performance from tech.   Stuart Varney weighing in on the huge gains from industry giants like  Amazon, Microsoft, Google.  And is the key to getting back on track going  off the rails?  Why General Electric is said to be considering an exit from  its railroad business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Titans of tech, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are they more  powerful than we thought?  Joining me now with his thoughts, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Even more powerful than we thought.  Well, yes, I  guess they are. I mean, turning in a performance like that yesterday  afternoon, those profit gains and now the stock price gains, I mean, for  those of you who are listening too what's on the radio, let me read this  out.  Amazon is $81.00 a share, Microsoft is up $5.00 a share, that's about  seven percent by the way, and Alphabet up is $43.00 per share.  Did anybody  see this coming?  I didn't.  I don't know about these analysts but I  certainly didn't, that was an absolutely blowout performance.  And it  extends the power of the American technology into whole new industries.   Why CVS is looking at Aetna, a corner drugstore with a health insurer, why?   Because Amazon is just around the corner coming on strong when may be the  delivery prescription drugs.  They are everywhere, these five technology  companies, they're just astonishing and quite frankly, Dagen, I am blown  away by it, period.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, because the decision if you're an investor, it literally  -- and we have talked about this for years.  It literally comes down to do  I want to own a piece of a great American business that's getting even big  -- bigger that is dominating a variety of fields or do I want to lend Uncle  Sam the Federal government, money for 10 years, and only get paid less than  2-1/2 percent in yield because that's really the decision if you're buying  a treasury versus a stock.  </p><p>VARNEY:  That's right.  Let's weigh this up, shall we? Do I join the  marking global economy and buy into technology stock and then my money goes  through the roof or do I lend -- as you say, lend to Uncle Sam and get me  two percent?  Which do I do?  OK.  I'm dead safe with Uncle Sam, I got it  but I'm going nowhere.  I'm taking a risk with technology, but I'm going  somewhere.  As for putting new money in now, that I'm not so sure of.  I'm  going to hold off on that, but as everybody knows, I do I own some  Microsoft and my point today is I'm not selling at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think Satya Nadella of Microsoft makes better decisions  with your money or Congress?  We already pay taxes, that's -- I know that's  a little simplistic but I always think -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VARNEY:  No, it's a loaded question.  That's what it is.  You know where  I'm coming from too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're fantastic each and every day.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart is coming up in almost exactly 15 minutes.  A reminder,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Three whole hours of  Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p>The first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter coming  in much better than expected.  Nicole Petallides on floor at the New York  Stock Exchange.  Hey, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good Friday morning, Dagen.  Yes, that's  right.  We're seeing the economy here in the U.S. in the latest quarter  grow faster than expected, at three percent rate faster than the 2.5  percent rate that was expected.  Why did that happen?  That was consumer  and also business spending that helped it along and that's why you did see  that growth there despite Harvey and Irma.  </p><p>Taking a look at Futures right now, up 17 points for the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  We'll see if we can make some records today.  Taking a  look at Merck, though, Dow component, Merck, that is to the downside this  morning, sales dropped three percent overall.  It did very well with  KEYTRUDA.  That is their U.S. long -- that's a cancer patient -- U.S.  cancer -- lung cancer and that really helped them along but not enough to  break through.  Stock down 2-1/2 percent, profit beat, they raised the  outlook but a sales miss overall.  </p><p>Then there's Colgate-Palmolive, so that was relatively flat.  Let's take a  look at that.  It did ramp up ad spending, about 20 percent ramped that up,  and that cut into the numbers.  That is down one-third of one percent.  And  good old G.E., well, G.E., of course, you know, we reported recently how  it's dropped out of the dividend portfolio for Morgan Stanley.  Well, now,  they're exiting and saying that they want to exit out of the railroad  business.  Just not seeing the demand, it is a seasonal business, it is --  is it inconsistent, and they have so many others from aviation to power,  health care, just to name some.</p><p>So, this morning, we're seeing it up one-quarter of one percent, but we did  see those new lows as to -- on 10.26 of 21.20.  We're not too far off of  that, so people are holding to this one for the long term, they've been  ultimately very disappointed, and there is talk (INAUDIBLE) outlook they  might be cutting the dividend, too.  And that's why Morgan Stanley,  ultimately, tried to pull them out of that portfolio for wealth management  because it's not really what they're looking for big picture.  </p><p>We have much more, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, coming up right after this, happy  Friday to you.  Keep it here on Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If Tesla wants to revolutionize how we drive, Zero Motorcycles  who wants to take your love of the road to the next level.  No noise, no  vibrations, but all the power and torque of the best bikes out there.  It's  electric and it's the next great American brand, completely made in the  United States.  Joining me now, is Zero Motorcycles' CEO, Sam Paschel.   Tell me about the bike, Sam, because I'm a Harley fan, that's a regular  old-fashioned and internal combustion engine.</p><p>SAM PASCHEL, ZERO MOTORCYCLES CEO:  It is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is not anything like that.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It is.  This is -- it's the most innovative motorcycle in the  world.  If you're familiar with a Harley, something like a Harley Sportster  1200.  Will have about 73 foot-pounds of torque.  That's basically how much  force is being applied to that back tire to really give you the  acceleration.  Zero Motorcycles -- the bike right in front of us has about  116 foot-pounds of torques.  So, you're getting the acceleration and  performance out of a, like a modern day superbike out of one of these  electric motorcycles.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you going after the audience that Harley Davidson goes  after?  What's your key demographic?  </p><p>PASCHEL:  The key demographics, we have three basic types of riders that  make up the majority of who we reach out to.  First, we have riders that  tend to have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  You know, the  electric motorcycle phenomenon, electric vehicles overall are still pretty  new.  In 2011, there were about 2,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States overall, four wheels, two wheels, everything else.  Flash forward it  last year, and there were about 160,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States and about 780,000 globally.  So, this phenomenon is catching on.   But within the motorcycle community, it's still relatively new.  So, the  three types of riders we generally get are riders who have a quiver of  bikes that have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  We get new riders,  people, that don't have that established connection with any one brand.   And throw a leg over a Zero and just fall in love with it.  </p><p>And three, and actually, probably the most common, we have riders who love  motorcycle riding at one point in their life, and then for one reason or  another, had a family, had kids, moved away from it, and now it's the lure  of electric and the differentiated ride that's really drawing them back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been on a Harley or eight in my days, and these bikes, they  don't have the roar and the rumble of a Harley that Harley riders and  devotees really crave.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It's true.  It's true.  If you think about riding a motorcycle,  and you've been on one, it's a -- it's an experience that uses all five  senses.  Three of those senses on an electric motorcycle are going to be  completely different than they are on a gas bike.  First, as you mentioned,  is the -- is the audio, the sound.  You're not going to have that same  rumble.  You're not going to have that same sense of sound.  You're going  to hear your surroundings a lot better.  You can hear what's going on  around you but you're not going to have that roar.</p><p>Number two, the smell and the fumes of a gas bike aren't really going to be  there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is my cologne.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Which is your cologne.  It's not mine today.  It's not mine  today.  It's the reason -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  -- I'm stepping on further way.  But third, and I think most  important is all the -- all the vibration that you tend to feel with the  gas bike, you don't feel with an electric motorcycle.  So the only thing  you're really feeling is your connection to the road and the ride.  For me  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  These are made in the United States, made in America just like  the Harley, so is that a selling point, too.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It's a huge point for our consumers.  The bikes have been  engineered from the ground up, designed and are all built in the bay area,  in Northern California.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How -- what are your sales like year-over-year, how much are  they growing?</p><p>PASCHEL:  They were growing in about a 35 percent compound annual growth  rate.  It's similar to what's happening in the E.V. space.  And two  dynamics at play, one, is a motorcycle market that tends to be a bit flat.   The second is an E.V. market that's growing rapidly.  Luckily for us, we're  tending to follow a curved of the E.V. market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about other products that you might be looking at outside  of motorcycles?</p><p>PASCHEL:  So, we have -- we have three basic business segments.  The first  is the commercial motorcycles which are for sale to consumers and  motorcycles for us --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I interviewed the founder of the company years ago when the  first bikes were rolling out.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Yes.  Neal was fantastic; he was a NASA-funded engineer at one  point, and a mountain bike and a motorcycle enthusiast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  The second segment for us is fleets and military.  It's a great  application for local police forces.  And third is this powertrain  business, where their companies that realize they're a little bit behind  the curve on electrification, we've got millions of miles underneath the  bikes, we've got 11 years of experience and they're coming to us to help  them electrify the products that they have already created. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam, good to see you.  Please come back.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  Thanks so much for having us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wish I would get on one but -- I'm not wearing my motorcycle  pants today.  Sam Paschel, thank you so much.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Thank you so much.  (INAUDIBLE) come out to California and we'll  get your leg throw over a bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, on a day like today, it's a little chilly, I'll take even  Northern California, the coldest place on the planet in the middle of July.   Thank you so much, Sam. </p><p>PASCHEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really good to see you.  Coming up, final thoughts from our  all-stars. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know why that song reminds me of Kevin Kelly but it  does.  Final thoughts right now.  Erin, to you first.</p><p>ELMORE:  I drank a whole Starbucks, it's obvious, Frappuccino, so I'm all  juiced up today.  My vote is for Trump to keep yelling as a (INAUDIBLE).   Have a happy weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin?</p><p>KELLY:  I'm going to bring -- wear my piano key necktie next time I'm out  here, and also it's important to note that CVS, only 14.5 percent of their  customers use mail order subscription through their pharmacy, Amazon is  coming for you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lea, final thoughts</p><p>GABRIELLE:  So the Congress, the budget resolution, well, that was due back  in April.  It's almost Halloween, if they get started on next year's now,  then they might get it done by Independence Day.  So I'd say, get it  moving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And here's my final thought to the people in Congress, the GOP  who are writing that house -- that tax reform bill, if you touch 401(k)  plans and make this market tank, you're going to own that, and you will  feel the wrath of President Trump for your remaining days in Congress.  A  big thanks to Erin Elmore, Kevin Kelly, and Lea Gabrielle.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  Mr. Varney starts right now with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p>Stuart, I don't know it if I'm early or late, but it's all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll take it.  I'll take it, Dagen, gratefully.  Thank you very  much indeed, Dagen.  All right.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p> The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p> Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p> Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p> That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p> In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p> And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p> Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p> And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p> All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p> KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p> By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p> But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p> The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p> That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p> This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p> The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p> So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p> What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p> Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p> So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p> Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p> But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p> I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p> And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p> So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p> Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p> As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p> So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p> Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p> So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p> So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p> I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p> They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p> We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p> And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p> A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p> But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p> So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p> Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p> In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p> Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p> Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p> Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p> But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p> KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p> I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p> ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p> ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p> ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p> ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p> And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p> And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p> KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p> They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p> Joining us now is --</p><p> SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p> What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p> This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p> So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p> Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p> 401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p> And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p> And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p> So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p> And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p> MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p> Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p> ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p> If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p> XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p> Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p> The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p> GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p> THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p> The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p> A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p> PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p> Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p> The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p> If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p> THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p> And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p> But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p> THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p> There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p> We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p> Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p> And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p> Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p> CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p> MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p> TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p> JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p> TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.  Still ahead, \"Hercules\" star Kevin Sorbo here.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p> Earnings blitz -- big names including Merck, ExxonMobil, Chevron all  reporting this morning.  Merck just hitting the tape, earnings of $1.11 a  share topping estimates while revenue missing expectations.  We see a  little move up to the stocks at least right here right now.</p><p> Budget passed -- the House making the move which is the key to any hope of  tax reform -- that hoping to get done this year.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross praising the passage.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think the vote today told  you that they didn't put any amendments at all.  They took it exactly as it  came from the Senate even though they had been talking about quite a few  amendments.</p><p> The only reason they would have had to doing that is to grease the skids  for the tax cuts.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting a deal done ahead.</p><p> Futures are showing gains across the board, certainly lifted by some  terrific numbers out of Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet and Amazon  yesterday evening.  Those three stocks in one hour late yesterday adding  about $80 billion in market value.  So we have gains across the board.</p><p> Later this morning, we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing last quarter.  The first reading -- could we get close to 3  percent?  Maybe.</p><p> In Europe, we have gains as well -- buying in England, France and Germany  to wrap up this week.  And it was the same story overnight.</p><p> Stocks ending the week higher in Asia -- Shanghai, Japan, Hong Kong and  South Korea.  </p><p> New details behind the JFK assassination -- the White House allowing the  release of thousands of previously blocked records.

Good to see you.  Good to see you, my man.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Loving it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're trying to rock out -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Rocking out on this Friday morning.  I mean especially with  technology killing it.  I mean think about this.  As your sales up 90  percent for Microsoft, Microsoft Office 365 -- revenues up 42 percent.   Technology is 23 percent of the overall markets so it's going to lead --  it's led it higher during the year.  It's going to lead it higher going  into the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amen, Mr. Kelly.  Amen.  Coming up this morning New York Stock  Exchange President Tom Farley talks to Maria; Softbank investment adviser  CEO Rajeev Misra; and Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel; actor and director  Kevin Sorbo along with his wife Sam Sorbo.  You don't want to miss any of  those guests.</p><p> To our top story this hour however -- investors looking to earnings this  morning.  Colgate reporting just moments ago.  Earnings per share in line  with estimates at 73 cents; revenue beating expectations at $3.94 billion.   Investors also waiting on the first reading on how fast the economy was  growing last quarter.</p><p> This following the passage of the House budget vote yesterday, a key step  in paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> Joining us now, global economics editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Jon  Hilsenrath.  Jon -- what do you want to start with because earnings are -- </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How about  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- coming in better than expected but again -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- do, does Wall Street -- do investors need that tax reform to  really keep pushing stocks higher here?  Well, I mean I think they're going  to get some kind of tax reform.  We had -- the House passed the budget  yesterday.  That's another step towards completion.</p><p> They have a very aggressive timetable they are setting out in the House to  have a bill done by Thanksgiving.  I mean it's very ambitious but it looks  like they're moving in that direction.</p><p> I think really that's just whipped cream on top of the sundae at this point  because the earnings numbers are so good.  And as you said in your lead up,  you know, we're going to be getting economic growth numbers out tomorrow  and I think they're going to come in pretty strong as well.  We're looking  for something a little bit south of 3 percent; that's after 3.1 percent in  the second quarter.</p><p> The economy is doing pretty well right now.  It isn't gangbusters but it  sure is enough to keep the stock market going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What's keeping it going?  Despite -- other than regulatory  reform out of the Trump administration, despite not move by Congress to  really tackle some major issues for the economy namely Obamacare and tax  cuts, tax reform.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, sometimes I think we put too much emphasis on  what's going on in Washington when things are going poorly and when things  are going well.</p><p> Right now, it's the whole world.  What we have is a very unusual  synchronized global upturn.  The European economy has just -- has started  turning up again after spending most of the last decade in a funk.</p><p> The Japanese economy is turning up too -- up again.  You know, we talk to  people there who say their equipment sales are rising because they're  selling more into the United States.</p><p> Emerging markets are picking up.  We have really a sweet spot in the global  economy and big multinational American companies like the tech guys who  reported yesterday are benefiting from it.</p><p> KELLY:  Jon -- are you concerned about the dollar though and the strength  of it?  And should we get higher interest rates going forward?  I mean  you've seen the 10-year tick up.  It's Kevin, by the way.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Are you worried about this global story that you are talking about.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think in a moment like this when the dollar  is strong you have to say -- you have to ask why is it strong?  You know,  why is it picking up?</p><p> We have the dollar picking up because the U.S. economy is in good shape and  because earnings for American companies are there.  So that's good news.   You know, does that, you know, maybe tone down the benefits to the export  sector, yes a little bit.</p><p> But when the global economy is doing well our exporters are going to do  well, too.  So I don't think a strong dollar is a sign of weakness in a  moment like this.  I think it's a sign of strength.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, I want to move on to the Federal Reserve.  I make a list  every morning of things that I think are important to talk about.  And I  made a list and it was earnings and it was the Federal Reserve chief.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump is looking to choose a new Fed chair potentially  when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.  Fox Business' Lou Dobbs sat  down with the President to discuss the candidates.  Watch this and I want  your reaction.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do you have a preference,  out of curiosity.</p><p> LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST:  I do and -- </p><p> TRUMP:  Tell me who your preference is.  I only want that from people I  respect.</p><p> DOBBS:  I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I'll tell you what.  She was in my office three days ago.  She's  very impressive.  I like her a lot.</p><p> In one way I have to say you like to make your own mark.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> TRUMP:  You understand that.</p><p> DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p> TRUMP:  You like to make your own mark which is maybe one of the things  she's got a little bit against her.  But I think she's terrific.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon -- you've covered the Federal Reserve for years.  You were  the man on the fed that everybody had to listen to.  What do you think?  Do  you have any sense of who the new Fed chief will be?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we spend so much time in the office right now  trying to figure out what's going on inside of Donald Trump's head.</p><p> You know, when you look at clips like when I hear it, I wasn't looking at  it, but when I hear it he sounds like he is very impressed with Janet  Yellen.  And you've got to ask yourself, why would he change horses in the  middle of the race that he's winning right now when growth is picking up,  unemployment is down, stock prices are at record highs.</p><p> But at the same time is he said in that clip with Lou, you know, there  seems to be some desire in the President's head and also inside the White  House to put his own mark on the place, to find his own person.</p><p> So I think -- I think he is really struggling -- not struggling but I think  he is really thinking carefully through this choice and through the pros  and cons of whether to keep her or whether to let her go.  He certainly -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Jon -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- is giving her a close look.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The conventional wisdom is if John Taylor is the next of Fed  chief that he's going to be more aggressive at raising interest rates. </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump is a real estate guy.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anybody in real estate doesn't really like higher interest  rates.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  No.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's very fixated on the performance of the stock market.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is one reason why I think we've been hammering possible  changes to 401(k) plans.  That's why it resonated with him. He's like why  are you going to mess with something that could cause the market to tank?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> And that brings you back to Janet Yellen.  So -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  The compromise candidate for him is Jay Powell, a governor at  the Fed right now who's basically been right at Janet Yellen's side with  every decision that she's made, you know.</p><p> So you've got to -- you've got to believe that if he picks Jay Powell, he's  getting a Republican.  He's also getting someone who is going to keep  interest rates relatively low.  But then that bring you back to the  question of well, if he's going to bring someone's who's going to look like  Janet Yellen in the policies that he pursues why not just bring back Janet  Yellen?</p><p> You know, we're going to know within the next week.  They say he's going to  make a decision before he leaves for Asia next week.  So we can stop having  this conversation and start talking about whether he made a good decision  or a bad decision.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon -- good to see you as always.  Jon Hilsenrath -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Sure thing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- I love how you said that like you're sitting in the \"Wall  Street Journal\" Washington bureau talking about what's in President Trump's  head.  Don't we all?</p><p> Actually, you know what -- usually -- thank you Jon.  Thinking of that we  don't really need to guess because he will tell -- President Trump will  tell you what's in his head.</p><p> And he just tweeted.  \"Wacky and totally unhinged Tom Steyer who has been  fighting me and my make America great again agenda from the beginning never  wins elections.\"</p><p> For background Steyer is a billionaire who is spending $10 million on a  national ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.  There you  have it.</p><p> More from the President I'm sure on Twitter and we'll bring you that as  soon as it happens.</p><p> Still ahead shedding new light on the shot heard around the world.   Declassified after decades -- we'll delve deeper into the newly released  files on the assassination of President John F.

Now the biggest tax cuts.\"</p><p> I love how he refers to it as tax cuts now.</p><p> The truth coming out -- numerous JFK assassination files have been  released.</p><p> Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest details -- Kevin.</p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there -- Dagen.  Good morning to  you.  A Red Bull morning here in the nation's capital when you think about  it the 2,800 documents released last night.  These are previously redacted  and classified documents.  And I apologize for all the noise as the leaf  blower goes by here a few times every morning right around the time I talk  to you.</p><p> But let me tell you what happened last night and this is actually a pretty  important story.  It's about the documents related to the assassination of  President Kennedy.</p><p> I think the real headline though would be the fact that many of the records  were withheld due to national security concerns, according to a memo from  the President.</p><p> Now, do keep this in mind.  Those documents contain raw intelligence.   That's uncorroborated and that's likely going to speculate -- or rather  fuel more speculation about the plot to kill the President.  We do learn a  lot about the frustration of FBI chief Herbert Hoover at Cuba's possible  role as well.</p><p> Let me share just a bit of a White House statement.  They talk about those  records that were not released overnight -- 2,800 documents.  Some people  would say it's just a drop in the bucket.  The remaining records will be  released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming  weeks.</p><p> The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from agencies,  directed them to minimize redactions without delay.  And this is an  important one from the CIA -- every single one of the approximately 18,000  remaining CIA records in the collection will ultimately be released with no  document withheld in full.  That is great.  That's a boon if you're a  researcher in particular. </p><p> Now that promise could shed more light about Lee Harvey Oswald, his trips  to Mexico before the assassination and, of course, the Castro regime  including U.S. efforts, by the way, to topple the communist dictator.</p><p> There are a number of days that we are keeping an eye on, Dagen, as we look  forward to the rolling release of these documents.  I want to point your  attention to April 26, 2018.  That's when we expect another big batch.  In  the meantime -- researchers rock on and see what you can find out.</p><p> Back to you with my friend in that bloody leaf blower -- got to love this  guy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Leaf blowers are as frightening as chainsaws and louder.  Kevin  -- you did a great job.  It's great to see you.</p><p> Kevin Corke at the White House.</p><p> Still ahead -- courting Aramco -- the president of the New York Stock  Exchange sitting down with Maria at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia to talk about what they're doing to land potentially the  biggest initial public offering of all-time.</p><p> Then Instagram getting up close and personal -- the dramatic new feature  coming to the social media app.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia our own Maria  Bartiromo was able to sit down with New York Stock Exchange president Tom  Farley and get his take on everything from the Trump effect on the market  to the magnitude of the expected Saudi Aramco IPO.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  And joining me right now is the president of  the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE president Tom Farley.  Tom -- it's good  to see you.</p><p> TOM FARLEY, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's great to be back with  you -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> FARLEY:  -- in this beautiful hall.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The hall in Saudi Arabia.  It's really incredible to me how  many people in investment management, business people are here in Saudi  this week.</p><p> FARLEY:  Yes.  I mean I was just waiting to sit down with you and impromptu  was able to have a conversation with Secretary Mnuchin, Steve Schwarzman,  Howard Marks.  And it is the great and the good of financing and finance  all around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, one of the big reasons obviously is this Saudi  Aramco deal.  They are going to take their state oil company public --  could be the biggest IPO ever.  It could be up to $75 billion.</p><p> You have Alibaba which is what -- a $24 billion deal.  This would be a huge  piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> FARLEY:  So, you know, people see me in the halls here as the head of the  New York Stock Exchange.  Everyone assumes that my relationship is totally  about the Aramco IPO.  I've actually known the -- from the minister level  to the company Saudi Aramco -- I've known the company for many years long  before the IPO was even a notion because as you know the New York Stock  Exchange is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the largest energy exchange  in the world.  I'm one of the managers of that business and Saudi Aramco is  a partner and a customer in that respect.</p><p> Regarding the IPO, we will compete for any IPO of a great global business.   I can't say too much about Saudi Aramco in particular other than anyone you  meet from the company or the ministry -- and I know you've met several of  them just this week.  They are professional.  They are sophisticated.  And  no surprise, they are carrying out a very disciplined, due diligence  process to make the right decision for Saudi Arabia as a whole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think you're going to get the deal.</p><p> FARLEY:  I'm not going to comment in particular because I don't want to  prejudice any decision that they make.  But for any great global IPO, look,  first of all we want them to make the right decision for them.  We won't  try to corner them in to make something we think is a wrong decision.</p><p> Clearly the New York Stock Exchange is the leading exchange in the world  for listings.  We have something like $34 trillion of market caps.  The  next closest exchange is a tiny, tiny fraction of that.</p><p> And so in terms of the deepest liquidity in the world that's in the United  States.  Brand name -- you get that from the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  also a rigorous governance test to be listed in the New York Stock  Exchange.  So if you list there, you're holding yourself out to be a very  well-run, well-governed company.</p><p> That is kind of the decision criteria that benefits what the New York Stock  Exchange brings.  But I have no doubt other exchanges around the world have  their own unique benefits as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are the implications of such a huge deal?  I mean if  you're looking at Alibaba being the biggest deal at $24 billion and this  deal is as high as $75 billion, give us a sense.  Give our viewers a sense  of why this is so important and what the global implications are for a  company this size to go public or to sell 5 percent of it to the public?</p><p> FARLEY:  So large IPOs are nerve-racking.  We do them a lot.  Of the top 20  IPOs of all time, I think the number is 13 have been on the New York Stock  Exchange.  And even those companies that fall on the other seven many of  them have ultimately listed in the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> We know a lot about big deals and the New York Stock Exchange is purpose- built for those big deals.  We combine humans and technology but we still  spend a lot of time getting ready for those IPOs because there is a lot of  bids and offers that come in that.  There's a lot of complexity on that  moment the stock opens.  And you need to make sure that stock opens  smoothly so that the management team of the IPO doesn't spend the next six  months or two years explaining what went wrong on IPO day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you what you're seeing right now at the New York  Stock Exchange in terms of listings.  Obviously there has always been a  massive competition between NYSE and Nasdaq.  What can you tell us in terms  of business year-to-date?</p><p> FARLEY:  Well, apropos of our interview location halfway around the world  from our normal home base, our shared home base it's a very global story.   The IPO market is booming in the U.S. and at the New York Stock Exchange.   We've had twice as many roundabouts, twice as many IPOs as all of last  year.  We've had this year twice as much in terms of dollar value and from  all around the world.</p><p> Last week alone we had a great company from Southeast Asia and we had  another company from China.  This week we have an Argentinian company, next  week a Brazilian company.  And so we are seeing great global companies  choosing the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing more global companies relative to the U.S.?   Because the truth is there are a lot of start-ups who are saying, you know  what, I don't want to go public.  The regulatory environment is too tight.   And I'm not going to.</p><p> So that's why there was a problem.  People were wondering why the IPO  market was not so busy earlier this year.  The start-ups were not going  public.  </p><p> FARLEY:  I'm glad you asked that.  You know, the American audience likes to  make a big deal out of a story.  There are not as many American tech  companies going public.  And that's true.  Some of the great American tech  companies have chosen to stay private.</p><p> The last week alone, we had a young man who started a company three years  ago to provide a technology that allows for consumer lending in China --  that company is now worth over $10 billion.  It's an amazing tech story.   And the Friday company, too was a technology company that offers gaming, e- commerce and payments from Singapore.  We just don't talk about it as much  frankly because it's not American.</p><p> But these are great tech companies choosing to go public, choosing the New  York Stock Exchange fortunately.  I'm appreciative that they did choose the  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, here is a stat for you -- listed public companies in the  U.S. down 50 percent over 20 years because of the regulatory environment.   I mean the President has said he is calling for IPOs, the bar for IPOs to  be lowered.  </p><p> The Treasury came out with a report. They're basically saying the  regulatory environment is way too hard for companies to go public.</p><p> What are you doing in terms of lowering the bar, in terms of lowering the  standards, making it easier for companies to go public?</p><p> FARLEY:  You know, I think you are referring to our press report that came  out.  And if you work your way down that press report the next paragraph  starts with some of the efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and I  personally have engaged in, to push the administration to make it easier to  engage in IPOs.</p><p> You mentioned the number of public companies.  It is down by about half.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  But the average market cap is up by over three times -- The  aggregate market cap.  So the average company is five or six times bigger.   The public market works great for big companies.  It's not working as well  for small companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p> FARLEY:  And we need to acknowledge that because small companies are the  life blood of free enterprise.  They give the inspiration to even smaller  companies.  They create jobs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what can you do?  What can you do to get more small  companies to go public then?</p><p> FARLEY:  Simple things.  The pendulum has swung too far on regulation with  Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Big companies can handle it.  Small  companies can't.  So if you can allow the small companies during the IPO  process to meet more with investors and analysts, you can reduce the  Sarbanes-Oxley requirements on small companies.</p><p> Like for example, not require an external audit for the first few years  that a company is public.  And you could extend that to all new companies  not just the tiniest ones but expand the envelope a little bit and have it  be for all new companies that are new to public market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean one thing is create a longer window of time in  which companies can be in the emerging growth category.</p><p> FARLEY:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  Exactly.  And what that emerging market growth category does is it  just requires less regulation for small companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  You know, regulation is like taxes.  No regulation isn't the  answer and complete government control isn't the answer -- somewhere in  between is the right answer, and the pendulum is going to swing.  We have  swung too far towards heavily regulating small companies and we need to  swing it back aggressively to make sure that that IPO engine is there for  those young entrepreneurs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What does the sentiment feel like to you when you go down on  the floor, when you speak to big investors?  Because how do you like the  way the President is constantly tweeting that market has gained $5.3  trillion in market value since Election Day?  We are at record highs --  23000 and counting.</p><p> Do you feel like things are getting overheated?  Do you feel the same  sentiment when you talk to investors that you did a year ago?</p><p> FARLEY:  I walk in on the floor and I look up at the indices every morning  and it's amazing what has happened since November.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Don't you think?</p><p> FARLEY:  We're 17400 that night, if you remember because the indices really  cratered and now they had zipped back up.  However I will note, it's also a  global story.  This isn't just America.  In the last two weeks alone the  DAX, the CAC, the (INAUDIBLE) -- they have all hit all-time highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> FARLEY:  So there is a really -- this is a really good moment globally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So do you feel like sentiment is still there?  The bullishness  or are people getting worried that things are getting over priced?</p><p> FARLEY:  People are bullish.  That doesn't mean there won't be a pullback  but people are bullish without question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Tom -- it's great to see  you.</p><p> FARLEY:  Great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> FARLEY:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tom Farley is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up rebuilding Puerto Rico -- 80 percent of the island is  still without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

It involves  zooming and getting in really close.</p><p> And rolling back prices and rolling out some robots.  The futuristic new  tech coming to Walmart to ensure that shelves are always stocked.</p><p> To our stop story this half hour.  The crisis in Puerto Rico.  Two house  committees and a federal watchdog are now investigating the $300 million  no-bid contract that was awarded to Whitefish Energy holdings to repair  Puerto Rico's flattened electrical grid.</p><p> Critics say Whitefish has little experience repairing electricity  infrastructure.  And alleged the company has ties to interior secretary,  Ryan Zinke.</p><p> Joining us now is the spokesman of Whitefish Energy Holdings, Ken Luce.   Ken, what do you say to these investigations?  Are they warranted?</p><p> KEN LUCE, SPOKESMAN, WHITEFISH ENERGY HOLDINGS:  No.  The investigations  are not warranted.  First off, PREPA hired a firm Whitefish Energy who has  extensive experience fixing transmission lines, especially in the  mountains, which is our assignment.  Our assignment is 100 miles of  transmission lines mostly in the mountains of Puerto Rico, which are  necessary to restore the power ultimately overtime.</p><p> The real issue congress should be asking is where are the other firms that  the core and CORE and FEMA are hiring to come to the island to help repair  the grid?  Those contracts were just let last week.  Meaning, it's another  two or three weeks before more help us to the island.  That's the  frustration in Puerto Rico is the resources are not there yet.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And part of the controversy is that  Whitefish only had two full-time employees as reported when Maria hit  Puerto Rico on September 20th and then since hired all these employees.</p><p> You have a pretty robust experience in PR.  When did the company hire you?</p><p> LUCE:  The company hired us two ago.  But again, the point here is the  entire industry ramps up when you get contracts.  Whitefish has experience  in the mountains which is why we were hired.</p><p> If you have a question about that, and the business practice of ramping up  much like homebuilders, consulting firms and others do, look at the results  to date.  320 people are already on the island, lineman and engineers,  repairing the grid.  So if there's a question, then look at the facts.</p><p> My real issue is no one has asked the questions and then reported the  facts.  There's just this jump to say nothing's being done which is  inaccurate.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  What are the facts that you think aren't being reported?</p><p> LUCE:  Well, I mean, the fact you have two employees and you have a  business model that ramps up just like hundreds of firms in the United  States and all over the world.  And you now have 320 employees.</p><p> So if you question a two-person firm with the ability, look at their  experience which is working in mountainous regions and the CEO is leading  that effort in Puerto Rico today and we have 320 people on the ground in  less than three weeks.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Ken.  Erin Elmore here.   There were also allegations -- </p><p> LUCE:  Hi.</p><p> ELMORE:  Hi.  How are you?  There were also allegations that interior  secretary, Ryan Zinke's son had an internship at Whitefish.  What do you  say about that?  And is there any correlations there that are troubling?</p><p> LUCE:  No.  He did.  He was a flagger.  So he directed traffic on a summer  job through a friend.  But to say the interior secretary had anything to do  with the contract, number one, it's not true.  Everyone has said so.  He  found out about the contract after it was let.  And he also has no  authority over FEMA, the CORE, PREPA, so again there's a jump today to  guilt versus facts.</p><p> And then the other part of that is, if you really look at the political  landscape in Puerto Rico, an interior secretary and the current  administration would not necessarily be popular in Puerto Rico where the  majority of the population supported the other party.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Jen, these investigations aren't going away or at least  inquiries, two health committees, a federal watchdog investigating the  contract, the $300 million, no bid contract.  The governor of Puerto Rico  Rossello, says his administration will soon audit the contract awarded to  Whitefish.  And there's a retired air force colonel appointed to oversee  the reconstruction of the electoral grid following concerns over this very  contract.</p><p> So a lot of eyes on Whitefish now.</p><p> LUCE:  And again, we, welcome them.  Every member of congress should have  the information that they're asking for.  And we will certainly give that  out, but the first thing is, there were no questions asked.  Everybody  jumped to a conclusion based on the \"Washington Post\" article and no one  called.  We reached out to offices before this happened and said, if you  want information, we're more than happy to give it to you.</p><p> The contract with PREPA was done correctly.  PREPA has a company working on  the island and the current administration does not had those resources  there yet.  We welcome it and at the end, I'm just hoping people report  that there was nothing there.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, the director of Puerto Rico's power company has been  quoted saying that part of the reason that Whitefish was selected as the  only company that didn't require a down payment.</p><p> So I wanted to ask.  This does require a lot of money.  So, how well and  how was -- hos is Whitefish finance for this?</p><p> LUCE:  Well, Whitefish is very well capitalized.  They had financing from  several private equity firms.  They have met all their obligations to date.</p><p> But let me go back.  There was a very small deposit.  It was $2 million, I  believe.  There were another firm that also wanted to work, but required 10  to 15 times that amount to begin to work.</p><p> So capitalization isn't an issue.  We have 300 people working on the  island.  We have barges coming over every day.  We're trying to get our  equipment through the ports so that more men and women can come to work and  help Puerto Rico.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ken, thank you so much for being here.

Cleveland Police say they saw the boy's car speed by, chased by another car  possibly driven his mother.</p><p> The 15-mile chase lasted less than an hour.  It finally ended after a  trooper was able to nudge the car into that sign, as you can see here with  his cruiser.  The kid was boxed in.  The kid was taken into custody.   Police say this same little boy stole his mother's Dodge Charger for a spin  and went down Interstate 90 earlier this month.  Yes, all right.</p><p>Instagram, introducing a new feature called Super Zoom.  Users can create  dramatic zoom and shots and you can set it to music.  This is the second  big update from Instagram this week.</p><p> Just days ago, they launched a live together feature.  Users can stream  live with friends.  Instagram saying last month they had 800 million  monthly active users across the world.</p><p> And Walmart planning to deploy robots now to 50 stores by the end of  January.  These robots are going to scan isles for out of stock items,  products that are in the wrong place, incorrect pricing, even wrong labels.   Walmart has been testing these robots in a span number of stores in  Arkansas and California.</p><p> Taking a look at the stock.  Shares of Walmart, Dagen, up about 28 percent  so far this year.  And those are your speedy headlines.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's insane.  And I think we should point out it's just  a miracle that nobody was hurt whether, it's the kid or a passenger in  another car, a driver in another car.  I want to point that out.</p><p> But in terms of this Instagram feature, Erin just changed my life when she  told me about this.  An app.  It's called YouCam Perfect.  It basically  edits your face.  And it's literally if you take a selfie, it takes about  20 years off my age.</p><p> Elmore:  I told you were never going to be the same again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I need to buy you -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Because now people can be using it when they're on their dating  websites.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You couldn't tell like way better than they actually do.</p><p> ELMORE:  It's just you only refreshed with a good night sleep.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Exactly.  I'm sure the person who meets up with you feel that  way too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  At the cancer center with my mother where I never wear any  makeup.  People see me now they're going to go, you look familiar but you  look like the older sister of somebody on television.  I'm like, OK,  thanks.</p><p> If only there's a filter we could walk around with an everyday life.  You  hand it to people.</p><p> Still ahead, let there be light.  Actor and director, Kevin Sorbo joining  us with his wife Sam Sorbo, to talk about their new movie shining a light  on the crisis of faith.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hollywood sexual harassment secrets revealed.  Our next guests,  \"Hercules\" actor, Kevin Sorbo, says he too was a victim.  Joining us now is  Kevin and his actress wife, Sam.  They're here to talk about their new  movie.</p><p> But, first, I wanted to talk about -- because you have come out and said  that you -- that Gianni Versace hit on him.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO, AMERICAN ACTOR:  In my book and it happened years ago.  It's  already in my book.  It's not like a secret.  I didn't suffer any trauma  from it but I'm not taking with the people who have, because it's out  there.  Look at them.  I'm a big dude.  Most people in Hollywood aren't  going to -- they're not going to kid on me.  They're afraid of me.</p><p> The most male actors are five-eight.  I'm a big guy.</p><p> SAM SORBO, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  What's amazing is to see now this sorted --  the sorted underbelly of Hollywood coming out.  And we have a film that's  coming out tonight and it's almost the antisepsis of that, right?  Produced  outside of Hollywood with Sean Hannity, as you know.  Not funded by  Hollywood at all.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fox News Channel, so he -- we have to disclose that.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  He's on the Fox News Channel.  No, it's true and so we're kind  of excited that -- because this film takes a different one.  This is the --  this is the film that Hollywood used to produce.  The uplifting film.  The  film with Godly character.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Prior to the '60s, Hollywood produced, character-driven  movies.  And now, it's changed.  They celebrate antihero.  They celebrate  sort of the negativity in life.  It's just weird to me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't think it's a stretch to say this that with Hollywood and  people in that industry broadly speaking that there's a disconnect between  individual and family and faith.</p><p> And that that -- it is largely an industry that is if they don't -- faith  is not front and center if people go to church regularly.  And so, do you  think that that opened the door for greater sexual harassment over decades?   And I'm not naming any individual.  But it's a lack connection to God and  higher power.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  It's actually -- it's a different face.  OK.  If you think of  it as a non-faith -- </p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Every movie is faith-based movie.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  Their face is different.  They put faith in Darwinism and  evolution and survival of the fittest, which is what Harvey Weinstein did.   Survival of the fittest.  He took what he wanted and he got it.  And  sometimes they made him pay for it and he was cool with that.  And it was  business as usual and everybody who knew about it was perfectly fine with  it.  It's a completely different face.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You worship at the altar of filth.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Yes.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  And so in our movie, we juxtapose the two, right?  We have two  people who are grieving and one of them worships at the altar of self.   He's basically an egomaniac.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  That's my character.  Yes, he's not a very good guy.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  And his ex-wife.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  But he's a lost man.  He's lost.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  He's lost.  And an ex-wife who is faithful and goes to church  and is raising their two boys in the Christian faith.  And so we juxtapose  the two.  And you can walk it alone or you can walk it with higher power  and you see the difference.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to watch this clip:  \"Let There Be Light.\"  Opens  nationwide today.  Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAM SORBO:  What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of  their brother and using his part of your carnival act?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  It pays the bills.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Daddy.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clinically dead in entrance for four minutes.  It's a  miracle.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's incredible.  And you wrote it, Sam.  You co-wrote the  script.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  I co-wrote it with Dan Gordon who's a very well-known Hollywood  screenwriter and I was -- I was lucky that he jumped right on board when he  heard the idea.  And then two weeks later, out of the blue Sean calls Kevin  and says.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Sean gave me a call and says, hey, I want to do movie with  you.  I love your got -- what soul-searching movie.  And I said, we got  one.  And we included in the arc and boom.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm going to put you on the spot.  Is this your favorite project  you've ever worked on?  Especially you work with your wife and she co-wrote  it?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Well, there's questions, one of my favorite ones.  It's in  the top five.  I've done between Hercules and a drama and then -- and then  54 movies.  I've done a lot of work.</p><p> I mean, but I'm very fortunate that I'm still working, because certainly  coming out of the conservative Christian closet in Hollywood for an  industry this of tolerance and freedom of speech, it's pretty much a one- way street with them.  So I've been very lucky to keep working.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  People can go to lettherebelightmovie.com.  They can find out  what theaters it's playing.  And if it's not playing in the theater near  you, I urge people to go, call the theaters or go to the website and  organize group tickets.</p><p> We found that there's a little bit of a threshold, higher thresholds for  faith-based films being booked into theaters.  If they're looking for some  sort of proof, some sort of presales and stuff, that they don't typically  look for in non-faith movies -- </p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Well, that's kind of typical for small independent movies.   It really is that way, if you don't have a big budget to promote.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  The idea with movies is, movies are storytelling.  They shape  the culture.  Hollywood shapes our culture.  Do we want the culture of  Hollywood to trickle down into this culture?  Do we want the culture of  Harvey Weinstein to be pervasive in the U.S. culture?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Kevin.  Are you finding though that people are more  receptive to conservative, more receptive to people who are kind of wear  their faith on the outside as a lot of people and other parts of the  Hollywood?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Let me tell you something.  I travel a lot.  One to airports.   Wherever I'm on streets, cities, no matter where I am, people walk up to me  now, not because of \"Hercules\" and drama, they walk to me because of  (INAUDIBLE) please make more movies like this.</p><p> So if they want to see more movies like this, they have to support them,  because like I said, we don't have the big budget to bring these out there.   And movies like this become successful because of word-of-mouth.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sam and Kevin Sorbo and you can see -- I'm on \"Outnumbered\"  today.  I'm lucky, guys.  So I'll be very nice.  I promise.  Thank you both  so much.</p><p> Still ahead, exed out.  Apple's iPhone 10 selling out already.  Presales  started earlier today.  When can you get it and how much will you pay?

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Earnings extravaganza, big names including Merck, ExxonMobil,  Chevron, all reporting this morning.  This comes after stellar, earnings  yesterday afternoon from tech giants, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent  Alphabet all delivering better-than-expected results.  Amazon shares  jumping on the news, CEO Jeff Bezos made about $6 billion extra on that  move.  Not the only good news for that retailer, the company gaining  wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states.  The part of driving force  behind CVS making a deal to buy health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66  billion.</p><p> The futures are showing begins across the board this morning.  We have a  32-point gain on the Dow futures, held higher by Microsoft stock again on  those positive earnings and also Intel, two Dow components.  We have gains  across the board.  Later this hour we get the first reading on fast U.S.  economy was growing in the third quarter.  The first reading on third- quarter GDP.  Investors also eyeing key developments out of Washington  including the House passing a budget and we have Exxon earnings coming in  right now.  Looking double beat, 66.17 billion on the revenue line and then  also earnings per share coming in higher as well.  93 cents a share on  Exxon versus an estimate of 86 cents a share.  So, a double beat on Exxon  and, again, those earnings growth in the energy sector from a year ago  gangbusters, so up triple-digit gains on earnings there.</p><p> Meantime, President Trump tweeting on the matter this morning saying, I'll  be talking about the House budget.  Congratulations to Speaker Ryan, GOP  Leader Steve Scalise and Republican Party on budget passage yesterday, now  the biggest tax cuts.  Moving on to new details behind the JFK  assassination, the White House allowing the release of thousands of  previously blocked records, the staggering revelation including a possible  warning nearly 30 minutes ahead of the tragedy.  And iPhone lovers braving  their early morning hours to order the iPhone 10.  The latest as preorders  for the highly-anticipated device go up online.  And Apple needs a winner  because those iPhone 8 sales, the slowest for a new device in years.  </p><p> The greatest of all time taking the wheel, the staggering amount it will  cost you to drive a special edition Aston-Martin designed by really?   Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.  That's right.  What can the man not do?   I'm joking.  And here with me to break it all down, Fox News Correspondent  Lea Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate, Erin Elmore.  Lovely to  be with you.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  I just want to say the Aston-Martin  comes with fully inflated tires.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh, hey yow.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Get down.</p><p> KELLY:  That's right. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the wife in the -- in the passenger seat nagging.  His wife  rather.</p><p> KELLY:  Does she nag?  I haven't heard her say a word ever.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Nag.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  The one thing we didn't say is that Stephanie Pomboy is going to be  here and she is one of our favorite economists especially when it comes to  GDP and she will give coverage and read-throughs that no one else has on  the streets.  She's my favorite person when she comes in.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kevin, you see, here is how it goes every morning since she do  the short show almost like two times a week.  We introduce the panel, and  then we promo the guests.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you just stepped on my promo.</p><p> KELLY:  I know, I know.  But I'm just so excited. </p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I thought I was just sober for coming  on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So he just -- so Kevin just stepped on this promo but we do have  SoftBank investment, Rajeev Misra coming up, SoftBank adviser/CEO, Maria  talked to him yesterday.  Sam Paschel, Zero Motorcycle CEO and \"VARNEY AND  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Don't miss -- and Stephanie Pomboy at the  bottom of the hour.  But busy earning season continues with two big oil  companies reporting.  We just had Exxon earnings hitting the tape, earnings  per share of 93 cents topping expectations.  Revenue also a beat.  Kevin  Kelly, your thoughts on the energy sector because again, this is huge surge  in earnings off the bottom a year -- near the bottom a year ago.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And that highlights the effect of what's really driving the  earning season this year because the energy sector was so depressed when  you think about where oil was even a year ago.  You had 25, 30, $35.00,  $45.00 a barrel of oil.  Now we stayed now consistently above 50 but that  hasn't played through yet.  So one of the interesting aspects is we're  going to want to see what guidance is going forward.  Investors are solely  focused on the effects of the hurricanes that are going to be in Chevron as  well as the Exxon.  What they see going forward where they are in terms of  cost cuts, that's been a very, very big focus for them because a lot of  times, the cost of oil a barrel is higher for a lot of these integrated  when you're thinking Exxon, Chevron, right?  So they're in -- they're all  over the globe, and so because there has been a depression of prices  globally that's affecting them, the last thing is also what they're going  to do M&amp;A wise.  People are worried that they need to start buying  companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory backdrop because we always focus on  Washington and what the Congress hasn't done on health care and taxes but  in terms of the regulation rollback that is something the Trump  administration has been on top of and that does particularly help energy  companies.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  That really helps energy companies and they've even spoken  about that on their investor and conference call all year long.  They're  waiting for actually even more deregulation to happen in the space  especially for them to deploy more of their capital because we've seen coal  as actually done really well this year and the supplies are up and people  are using it more especially with renewable energies and a lot of tax  credits that are flowing through on there.  So a lot -- a lot of policy  coming out of Washington is going to dictate what happens to these  companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google on track  for record highs today.  Amazon stock also getting a boost; Microsoft and  Intel really pushing up the Dow futures this morning.  You look at these  stocks go and Amazon on the news that not just earnings but Amazon is  getting into the pharmacy business or it's gotten approval for wholesale  pharmacy licenses and at least dozens stays.  This comes as the Wall Street  Journal, Kevin, is reporting that giant drugstore chain CVS is in talks to  buy the third largest insurer in the country.  Aetna for $66 billion.  This  CVS deal is in direct response to Amazon, is that right?  What other kinds  of deals could we be looking at in response to Amazon's move into more and  more businesses?  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And this really is a shot across the bow because if you think  about what did Amazon do that was of the most significant recently, they  bought Whole Foods, right?  So with getting the state licenses, with  pharmacies can they start distributing -- basically prescription drugs  through their whole partnership and logistics with Whole Foods.  So you see  CVS actually now striking out and looking to do a deal with Aetna and  insurer which they have no experience in.  So this is actually pretty  telling.  We're going to see this story play out over the next couple  quarters, not years.  There is going to be a lot of activity and we're  going to get a lot of activity and we're going to get a lot of direction  that's coming through on that.  And you can see, Amazon is fighting, Wal- Mart toe-to-toe and especially when in the next leg of fight with them is  in the -- is in the prescription drug business.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is a huge business.</p><p> ELMORE:  Prices can come way down.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are some drug packages like with Medicare prescription  drug packages packages, the part D that you can only buy prescriptions at  like major pharmacy like you aren't able and allowed to go and buy -- get  prescriptions at smaller like local pharmacy.  You literally have to.   Where I'm from you have to go to Wal-Mart.  It's the only place you can go.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  And the Whole -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, again trying to break up that juggernaut.</p><p> KELLY:  And Amazon's idea behind this is the description model.  So people  don't need to continuously go to the pharmacy if they have a physical  presence and then they can get that subscription.  They'll figure out the  delivery and like I said, with their logistic systems that they do have  with Whole Foods.</p><p> ELMORE:  And the delivery is a great idea for people that are homebound or  wheelchair bound, things like that, it's also helping that market, they  really can't help themselves, so I think that's really nice for us people.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But with this CVS acquisition of Aetna in terms of what it could  potentially do expanding, basically giving a huge number of new customers  through Aetna for its pharmacy benefit management business bolstering its  leverage in negotiation for drug with drug makers in terms of pricing power  and then also you strike deals with -- to tie drug prices to patient  outcomes which is also incredible.  I want to move on to Washington, this  time, it's about truth coming out of D.C.  Numerous JFL assassination filed  released.  Blake Burman is at the White House with the very latest.  Blake,  good morning.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  And this was nearly 2900 additional documents relating to  President Kennedy and his assassination that were produce last night by the  National Archives, not all the documents though within this last batch  though were put forward as the president said in a memo that \"Certain  information should continue to be redacted because of national security,  law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.\"  These newest documents  though do shed more details about the events surrounding the assassination  of JFK.  For example, one shows that a British reporter received a phone  call about 25 minutes before President Kennedy was shot and was told that  there would be impending \"Big news.\"  </p><p> Another detail show an FBI source then claimed days later that the Soviet  Union was fearful that a missile could head their way because of the  actions of an irresponsible U.S. general.  This final batch of the last set  of documents has to be released now by the end of April.  And President  Trump tweeted out moments ago the following, he said and I quote, \"JFK  files are being carefully released.  In the end, there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to the public.\"   For now, Dagen if you need good some good reading, you're just curious or  whatever it might be, all you have to do is head on over to National  Archives Web site, the documents are listed right there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm tempted, I am really tempted when I came out I was  (INAUDIBLE)I got other stuff I need to read.  So yes, weekend reading.   Thank you so much --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BURMAN:  It will be there for a while.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  Great to see you as always.   Preorders for the iPhone selling out in just minutes, overnight.  What it  means for anyone trying to get their hands on this hot device.  The release  date is technically November the 3rd but what if you need it before  Christmas or the holidays?  And nobody can drive down the field like Tom  Brady but at least you can drive down the road like the Patriots superstar.   The hot new ride from Aston-martin inspired by the greatest of all time.</p><p> KELLY:  Not.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Preorders for the Apple 10 iPhone starting today but you might  have trouble getting yours in.  Cheryl Casone has more details on this.   Hey, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Hey, Dagen.  Sources saying supplies of the hot  new phone are sold out, shipping estimates slipping well beyond the  November 3rd launch date here in the U.S. on Apple's Web site five to six  weeks right now.  According to one report by the way out in Hong Kong,  they're sold out online with both models of the iPhone 10 currently  unavailable.  That's in that country.  The phone apparently also sold out  on Apple's Web site over in the U.K.  Now this news coming on weak sales of  the iPhone 8 by the way, two research firms saying the 8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  Shares of Apple trading  higher in the premarket higher by more than one percent.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco, Kiko  Alonso nails it, knocks off Flacco's helmet.  And then huge fight ensues  after the hit.  Alonso was given the unnecessary roughest penalty, Alonso  crushing Flacco as he goes for the (INAUDIBLE) Flacco would go straight  into the locker room with a concussion and he would not return to the game.</p><p> Well, let's stay with some football here.  Tom Brady has got a pretty cool  new ride, Aston-Martin selling a special Tom Brady signature edition car.   The luxury convertible for $360,000.  The British sports car usually  associated with 007, it's now going T.V. 12.  Brady's signature is on the  door, on the plates, on the doors, on the T.V. 12 logo.  It's all over the  vehicle basically.  It's on the fender, it's on the headrest.  But if you  want one, keep in mind there's only 12 of these being made.</p><p> And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has launched the zombie  Frappuccino, the drink apparently inspired by an apple dips and caramel,  taste like a tart green apple we are told.  We're going to find out just a  second in our taste tester on set.  Starbucks hoping the drink is going to  -- well, catch on like the uniform Frappuccino which was a huge hit back in  April for the company.  Starbucks, the stock anyway is down about one  percent in the premarket right now.  Stock to watch.  So let's go with  these. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What's the verdict?  OK.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I do think it taste like a tart green apple with caramel.  It  really --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, yes.  It's a lot of ones.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ELMORE:  -- together and put in a blender and eat it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cheryl, technically if it's a zombie Frappuccino, wouldn't it  taste like rotting flesh?</p><p> CASONE:  No.  Well, you know, you would think so, Dagen, but I don't think  that's what they're going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p> KELLY:  You also like to know what rotting flesh tastes like, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p> CASONE:  The pink whipped cream is supposed to be the brains, OK?  The red  mocha drizzle is blood obviously.  It might gross you out. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CASONE:  No, but, you know, by the way, you have to like kind of drink them  quick, because once they kind of -- the mixed up basically they're saying  like you -- once you order these, like don't like hold on to it because it  -- and then it gets kind of funky color.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Slurpy same thing happens. </p><p> ELMORE:  Yes.  Slurpy, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, paving the way for a public debut.  Maria, sitting  down with a top name from SoftBank to top about the timeline for a possible  Uber IPO. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you, ESPN reporting that Alibaba co- founder Joseph Tsai has reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49  percent minority stake The Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets worth $1.8 billion by  the latest valuation according to Forbes Magazine.  So, the Nets --</p><p> KELLY:  That's the Chinese and the Russians together now owning the Nets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I still not go to games.  Where can you find value in this  market?  Maria Bartiromo sat down with SoftBank investment adviser Rajeev  Misra in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where she asked him just that.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  You are $100-billion vision fund is dominating  conversations across the world, congratulations -- </p><p> RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISE, SOFTBANK:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- on the performance as well.  Tell us how you're allocating  capital.  Where are the growth opportunities in the world today? </p><p> MISRA:  Group opportunities are everywhere but it's concentrated with  entrepreneurial equal system exist and that's primarily in two locations,  China and U.S. If you look at our fund and we have two pools of capital in  SoftBank.  The vision fund which a hundred billion, plus SoftBank group  itself which makes a lot of technology and investment off this balance  sheet.  We own -- we bought the ARM last year, we have Sprint, and SoftBank  Mobile, we have 28 percent stake in Alibaba that also has grown in value  and so there are two pools of capital.  But almost half our investments are  going into U.S. 50 odd billion, a lot chunk will be in China where there's  a large population-based and there they are leapfrogging technology to  include a large part of the population hence from ride-sharing companies  like Didi to bicycle-sharing that go for food delivery, et cetera, et  cetera is very exciting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you.</p><p> MISRA:  No, Uber is not looking to take 10 billion from us, they will get a  billion -- a billion and one half as primary investment.  There is  potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity to shareholders and  employees who are early investors to sell secondary shares to SoftBank and  we are late-stage discussions to potentially buy some secondary shares from  early investors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the valuations, is it harder today to find  value which is also a growth story?  I mean, obviously, Alibaba has been an  incredible performer for you, but when you look elsewhere, is there another  Alibaba out there?  </p><p> MISRA:  There may not be Alibaba but we make a thousand times in return but  we vested Nvidia nine months ago, we bought five percent of Nvidia for --  close to $3 billion, it's worth six billion in nine months.  So you don't  have to find just Alibaba to make good investments.  We are going through a  technology revolution as we speak in every aspect of human life, from food  delivery to life sciences to as I said insurance, to selling used cars, to  selling homes, to buy -- getting a mortgage, to so far getting us to loan,  every aspect of life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everything is the sharing economy.  </p><p> MISRA:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right? </p><p> MISRA:  So there is plenty of opportunities.  Valuation is not an issue if  you find the right companies that are market leaders, that have the right  entrepreneur and management, to scale, to go global, this is what SoftBank  helps with and we are a consumer company too.  We have 35 million  subscribers with Sprint, with 35 million subscribers in SoftBank Mobile in  Japan, et cetera.  And getting these companies to work with each other,  learning from each other, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  A ride- sharing companies in India Ola learns a lot from Didi in China from their  experiences and vice versa.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Telecom has been really critical for you.  Why is Telecom sort  of the underlying important, you know, backdrop of some of your  investments? </p><p> MISRA:  There are four factors that are shaping the technology revolution.   First, processing power, the ability to process and the cost of processing  has gone through phenomenal scale where your iPhone today can process  cheaper and faster than mainframe 15 years ago or a laptop computer 10  years ago, data, second.  Ability to collect data and able to process the  data which is driving (INAUDIBLE) in media which is called the graphic  processing unit and ability to structure large and analyze large  unstructured data pools and make sense out of it and predict outcomes and  predict consumer behavior, managing inventory and be able to analyze that  kind of data.  So data -- ability of collecting data and having access to  data is a second factor.  Processing data software to analyze it and  lastly, Telecom speed and cost of Telecom.  Look at 10 years ago, there  were no smartphones.  Smartphones came in 2007.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now can't live without them.  </p><p> MISRA:  And we can't live without them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> MISRA:  And the ability to have that kind of processing power in your car,  in your smartphone, in your house, so on.  Telecom speed is important for  that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) Let me ask you about A.I. and the worry there.   People are wondering what skill set do I need to drive in this new world.   A.I. means robotics machine learning.  Are we going to have more robots  than humans?  Are they going to take human's jobs?.  </p><p> MISRA:  We already have a lot of robots, car is a robot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  True.</p><p> MISRA:  You know, a robot doesn't have to walk and speak, I mean, they're  kind of bots and robots.  A phone --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, should we be afraid of it?  </p><p> MISRA:  Not at all.  You have more -- you have robots today versus 10 years  ago.  You have all these cars that robots, your iPhone is a robot, et  cetera, et cetera.  They only would make -- enable your life a lot better.   They will provide healthcare services better, they will make your  entertainment better, you can listen to music, your wristwatch, your  tracker, but what skills the young needs to know and learn is there's so  much learn by -- you don't have to be a computer programmer to be -- to be  successful in this -- in the next generation.  You need to learn -- you  need to go to China, you need to go to India, see what -- all you need to  do is take what's successful in one part of the world and take it to  another.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Rajeev, it's great to have you on the program today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> MISRA:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The first reading on third-quarter GDP on the other  side of this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  3.0 percent, that's how fast the U.S. economy was growing, this  is the first reading on the third quarter gross domestic product, it's our  biggest measure, most important measure of how the overall U.S. economy is  doing.  The expectation was for 2-1/2 percent, they're about to get three  percent and see that nice three number in the front of GDP growth.  It is  kind of exciting if you want the U.S. to do well.  Joining us now is one of  our favorites guest of all time, MacroMavens president, Stephanie Pomboy.   Stephanie, just your initial take on this three percent reading, how is it  that we're growing at a three percent growth? </p><p> STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Wow.  Well, you know, I'm  surprised, I want to see the details in terms of the inventory contribution  versus the consumer spending because obviously what we care about is seeing  strong spending rather than just some inventory bill.  And I know that at  least the Atlanta fed and they're, therefore, had built in almost a full  percentage point contribution from inventories largely due from hurricanes  that we saw.  So that will be interesting to look at but as you know, you  know, my concern has been that there's been a broad deceleration in growth,  not that the wheels are off but that in a way it been general turning  downward this highways a little bit.  Since 2015, I've seen slowing tax  receipts, actually, treasury tax receipts are now down year and year which  is a recession reading.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> POMBOY:  So there's some things that just don't square with the strength of  the headlined numbers and I'm very interested to find out, you know, what  the details here are.  The other thing we're seeing that's a little is  disturbing kind of conflicts with the strong headline spending in GDP  numbers are the rise and the delinquencies.  So, there are couple things  out there that have me concerned and this is why I'm so anxious to see the  tax cuts come through because we need to pass this baton from monetary to  fiscal policy and get some more (INAUDIBLE) into the economy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think this three percent though gives Congress more --  that they think, the economy is doing OK, there is no urgency? That's my  worry.  </p><p> POMBOY:  That's the danger, exactly.  I mean, I'm -- since I'm looking at  thing like tax receipts and delinquencies and, you know, the slowing  consumer discretionary spending, I'm worried, you know, I'm sitting here  biting nails like they've got to get this done fast.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, I'm glad you brought up tax receipts because I'm extremely  worried because the Fed keeps saying we haven't had inflation but they're  looking at the wrong indicators.  Look at asset inflation, it's been  unbelievable, look at health care, the price of health care has gone up  exponentially.  The price of getting a college education has gone up  significantly.  So when they're talking about the PCE and they're talking  about CPI, those are all just like, you know, areas for them to deflect.   Asset inflation they've even been worried about.  Now, do you see headwinds  coming about because now we're at -- I'm looking where recession highs for  the dollar, 10-year yields are going up.  I mean, do you see that this  could be the only two-quarter GDP for that we get that's good given the  headwinds?  </p><p> POMBOY:  Well, this is what I worry about, you know, I'm glad you talked  about the rising cost of health care intuition, housing expenses have gone  up a lot in the couple of years.  So if you strip out housing in health  care, you know, that's 40 percent of the increasing in consumer spending.   So discretionary spending as I said, you know, has been slowing and  actually, people are now relying more on credit cards and transfer payments  to, you know, cover their everyday necessities.  So I think it's a major  issue and then you've got the Fed doing Q.T. which isn't going to help in  terms of, you know, tightening credit conditions, et cetera.  So this is  why again, I come back to the urgency of really getting these tax cuts  through and getting some relief because right now, clearly the trend toward  decelerating growth notwithstanding this current GDP, the third quarter is,  you know, going to continue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is the best six-month stretch since mid-2014 for the  economy in terms of GDP, and the commerce department said that this was  particularly interesting or strong, because of the hurricane.  We were  still able to grow at three percent for the quarter.  And this is the first  reading, it could be revised downward or upward, but, again, it was  particularly spectacular for that reason because of the weather.  </p><p> POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I think the things to watch going forward is what's  happening obviously on the consumer spending front, like you said, you  know, I think some of the data actually, the monthly data had been  surprisingly strong over that hurricane period.  We did see yesterday,  retail inventories were much weaker though when you saw auto inventories  thankfully, you know, post their largest decline since the recession and  that's sort of a silver lining of this hurricane, and you might have  provided all these producers some relief on the inventory front because  they've been dealing with very high -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, here we go.  Consumer spending gain was driven by motor  vehicles as Americans replaced cars damaged by the storms and then services  spending by contrast flow to its weakest since 2013, so that goes into your  kind of discretionary spending outside of housing and health care.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about inventories and --  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I'm pulling that out.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Can I ask you real quick about the  Fed and the plan to unwind balance sheets the Fed, what risk do you see in  terms of future GDP from that?  </p><p> POMBOY:  Well, I think we are credit dependent economy, you know, I always  talk about how it's the car basically, and credit is the fuel that gets it  going, and we've actually reached the point where we rely -- we're getting  worse mileage basically, we need gas in the tank go each additional GDP  mile.  So if you're to start to reduce the supply of fuel in the economy,  the credit fuel which is what the Fed is basically going to do but natural  tendency of the economy is going to be to grow with a slower rate.  And  we're already, you know, in the deceleration phase and the interesting  thing on that too is bank credits, total bank lending has already rolled  over sharply ahead of Q.T.  So, we haven't gone to see the real Fed  tightening and yet credit conditions are already starting to slow down.  So  this again, you know, just underscore why I'm really focused on the tax  cuts because, you know, we got to pass the baton from monetary to fiscal  policy, and right now, you know, it's a nail-biter.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And trading inventories added a combined 1.14 to the growth.  </p><p> POMBOY:  OK.  Yes.  It was supposed to add about .8, so that's a  substantially larger ad.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> POMBOY:  So real final sales been were one-six.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> POMBOY:  So that's not, you know, that's not from 2.9 last quarter.  That's  a pretty big slowdown.  So -- anyway, totally we'll get this tax cut.</p><p> POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) in the --</p><p> KELLY:  Real economy.</p><p> POMBOY:  In the real economy.  That would be nice.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stephanie, it's so good to see you always.  Because you all --  every time we talk to you, you always tell us something that we don't know  and it's just a different --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> POMBOY:  Well, that's my job.  I think, you know, let's focus on the stuff  these people are focused on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Some people kind of tell you what you've already heard 800  times.  Not you, Stephanie Pomboy.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> POMBOY:  Thank you so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Have a great weekend.  Big oil in focus this morning as well,  Exxon and Chevron reporting earnings, both companies topping expectations.   Joining us now is price futures group senior market analyst, fox business  contributor, Mr. Phil Flynn.  Mr. Flynn, what do you see in these earnings?</p><p> PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  We're  putting the big back in big oil.  How about that?  I mean, these are  companies that a couple years ago were given up for dead, ExxonMobil used  to be the biggest energy company in the world, moved down to number four,  Chevron, of course, had some major problems with earnings, but what a  comeback right now, especially if you look at ExxonMobil, what an amazing  earnings quarter when you consider the fact that their entire refining  operation on Gulf Coast was under water last quarter.  </p><p> They're saying that their earnings would have been even better, you know,  four cents better if it weren't for that situation.  So we're seeing  something going on that's reflected not only in oil prices but in the GDP.   You know, sometimes this comeback in oils really reflective of what we've  been seeing in the economy and the economy that's recovering not only here  but around the globe, and that's why I'm really excited about big oil and  big earnings because that means the economy is feeling, demand for oil and  natural gas is going up, that means people are working so this is great  news for the economy today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Phil, great to see you as always.  Phil Flynn.</p><p> FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Coming up.  An electrifying performance from tech.   Stuart Varney weighing in on the huge gains from industry giants like  Amazon, Microsoft, Google.  And is the key to getting back on track going  off the rails?  Why General Electric is said to be considering an exit from  its railroad business.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Titans of tech, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are they more  powerful than we thought?  Joining me now with his thoughts, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Even more powerful than we thought.  Well, yes, I  guess they are. I mean, turning in a performance like that yesterday  afternoon, those profit gains and now the stock price gains, I mean, for  those of you who are listening too what's on the radio, let me read this  out.  Amazon is $81.00 a share, Microsoft is up $5.00 a share, that's about  seven percent by the way, and Alphabet up is $43.00 per share.  Did anybody  see this coming?  I didn't.  I don't know about these analysts but I  certainly didn't, that was an absolutely blowout performance.  And it  extends the power of the American technology into whole new industries.   Why CVS is looking at Aetna, a corner drugstore with a health insurer, why?   Because Amazon is just around the corner coming on strong when may be the  delivery prescription drugs.  They are everywhere, these five technology  companies, they're just astonishing and quite frankly, Dagen, I am blown  away by it, period.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, because the decision if you're an investor, it literally  -- and we have talked about this for years.  It literally comes down to do  I want to own a piece of a great American business that's getting even big  -- bigger that is dominating a variety of fields or do I want to lend Uncle  Sam the Federal government, money for 10 years, and only get paid less than  2-1/2 percent in yield because that's really the decision if you're buying  a treasury versus a stock.  </p><p>VARNEY:  That's right.  Let's weigh this up, shall we? Do I join the  marking global economy and buy into technology stock and then my money goes  through the roof or do I lend -- as you say, lend to Uncle Sam and get me  two percent?  Which do I do?  OK.  I'm dead safe with Uncle Sam, I got it  but I'm going nowhere.  I'm taking a risk with technology, but I'm going  somewhere.  As for putting new money in now, that I'm not so sure of.  I'm  going to hold off on that, but as everybody knows, I do I own some  Microsoft and my point today is I'm not selling at this point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think Satya Nadella of Microsoft makes better decisions  with your money or Congress?  We already pay taxes, that's -- I know that's  a little simplistic but I always think -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p>VARNEY:  No, it's a loaded question.  That's what it is.  You know where  I'm coming from too.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're fantastic each and every day.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart is coming up in almost exactly 15 minutes.  A reminder,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Three whole hours of  Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p> The first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter coming  in much better than expected.  Nicole Petallides on floor at the New York  Stock Exchange.  Hey, Nicole. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good Friday morning, Dagen.  Yes, that's  right.  We're seeing the economy here in the U.S. in the latest quarter  grow faster than expected, at three percent rate faster than the 2.5  percent rate that was expected.  Why did that happen?  That was consumer  and also business spending that helped it along and that's why you did see  that growth there despite Harvey and Irma.  </p><p> Taking a look at Futures right now, up 17 points for the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  We'll see if we can make some records today.  Taking a  look at Merck, though, Dow component, Merck, that is to the downside this  morning, sales dropped three percent overall.  It did very well with  KEYTRUDA.  That is their U.S. long -- that's a cancer patient -- U.S.  cancer -- lung cancer and that really helped them along but not enough to  break through.  Stock down 2-1/2 percent, profit beat, they raised the  outlook but a sales miss overall.  </p><p> Then there's Colgate-Palmolive, so that was relatively flat.  Let's take a  look at that.  It did ramp up ad spending, about 20 percent ramped that up,  and that cut into the numbers.  That is down one-third of one percent.  And  good old G.E., well, G.E., of course, you know, we reported recently how  it's dropped out of the dividend portfolio for Morgan Stanley.  Well, now,  they're exiting and saying that they want to exit out of the railroad  business.  Just not seeing the demand, it is a seasonal business, it is --  is it inconsistent, and they have so many others from aviation to power,  health care, just to name some.</p><p> So, this morning, we're seeing it up one-quarter of one percent, but we did  see those new lows as to -- on 10.26 of 21.20.  We're not too far off of  that, so people are holding to this one for the long term, they've been  ultimately very disappointed, and there is talk (INAUDIBLE) outlook they  might be cutting the dividend, too.  And that's why Morgan Stanley,  ultimately, tried to pull them out of that portfolio for wealth management  because it's not really what they're looking for big picture.  </p><p> We have much more, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, coming up right after this, happy  Friday to you.  Keep it here on Fox Business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If Tesla wants to revolutionize how we drive, Zero Motorcycles  who wants to take your love of the road to the next level.  No noise, no  vibrations, but all the power and torque of the best bikes out there.  It's  electric and it's the next great American brand, completely made in the  United States.  Joining me now, is Zero Motorcycles' CEO, Sam Paschel.   Tell me about the bike, Sam, because I'm a Harley fan, that's a regular  old-fashioned and internal combustion engine.</p><p> SAM PASCHEL, ZERO MOTORCYCLES CEO:  It is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And this is not anything like that.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It is.  This is -- it's the most innovative motorcycle in the  world.  If you're familiar with a Harley, something like a Harley Sportster  1200.  Will have about 73 foot-pounds of torque.  That's basically how much  force is being applied to that back tire to really give you the  acceleration.  Zero Motorcycles -- the bike right in front of us has about  116 foot-pounds of torques.  So, you're getting the acceleration and  performance out of a, like a modern day superbike out of one of these  electric motorcycles.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are you going after the audience that Harley Davidson goes  after?  What's your key demographic?  </p><p> PASCHEL:  The key demographics, we have three basic types of riders that  make up the majority of who we reach out to.  First, we have riders that  tend to have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  You know, the  electric motorcycle phenomenon, electric vehicles overall are still pretty  new.  In 2011, there were about 2,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States overall, four wheels, two wheels, everything else.  Flash forward it  last year, and there were about 160,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States and about 780,000 globally.  So, this phenomenon is catching on.   But within the motorcycle community, it's still relatively new.  So, the  three types of riders we generally get are riders who have a quiver of  bikes that have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  We get new riders,  people, that don't have that established connection with any one brand.   And throw a leg over a Zero and just fall in love with it.  </p><p> And three, and actually, probably the most common, we have riders who love  motorcycle riding at one point in their life, and then for one reason or  another, had a family, had kids, moved away from it, and now it's the lure  of electric and the differentiated ride that's really drawing them back.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've been on a Harley or eight in my days, and these bikes, they  don't have the roar and the rumble of a Harley that Harley riders and  devotees really crave.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It's true.  It's true.  If you think about riding a motorcycle,  and you've been on one, it's a -- it's an experience that uses all five  senses.  Three of those senses on an electric motorcycle are going to be  completely different than they are on a gas bike.  First, as you mentioned,  is the -- is the audio, the sound.  You're not going to have that same  rumble.  You're not going to have that same sense of sound.  You're going  to hear your surroundings a lot better.  You can hear what's going on  around you but you're not going to have that roar.</p><p> Number two, the smell and the fumes of a gas bike aren't really going to be  there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is my cologne.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Which is your cologne.  It's not mine today.  It's not mine  today.  It's the reason -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  -- I'm stepping on further way.  But third, and I think most  important is all the -- all the vibration that you tend to feel with the  gas bike, you don't feel with an electric motorcycle.  So the only thing  you're really feeling is your connection to the road and the ride.  For me  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  These are made in the United States, made in America just like  the Harley, so is that a selling point, too.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It's a huge point for our consumers.  The bikes have been  engineered from the ground up, designed and are all built in the bay area,  in Northern California.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How -- what are your sales like year-over-year, how much are  they growing?</p><p> PASCHEL:  They were growing in about a 35 percent compound annual growth  rate.  It's similar to what's happening in the E.V. space.  And two  dynamics at play, one, is a motorcycle market that tends to be a bit flat.   The second is an E.V. market that's growing rapidly.  Luckily for us, we're  tending to follow a curved of the E.V. market.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about other products that you might be looking at outside  of motorcycles?</p><p> PASCHEL:  So, we have -- we have three basic business segments.  The first  is the commercial motorcycles which are for sale to consumers and  motorcycles for us --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I interviewed the founder of the company years ago when the  first bikes were rolling out.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Yes.  Neal was fantastic; he was a NASA-funded engineer at one  point, and a mountain bike and a motorcycle enthusiast.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  The second segment for us is fleets and military.  It's a great  application for local police forces.  And third is this powertrain  business, where their companies that realize they're a little bit behind  the curve on electrification, we've got millions of miles underneath the  bikes, we've got 11 years of experience and they're coming to us to help  them electrify the products that they have already created. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sam, good to see you.  Please come back.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  Thanks so much for having us.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I wish I would get on one but -- I'm not wearing my motorcycle  pants today.  Sam Paschel, thank you so much.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Thank you so much.  (INAUDIBLE) come out to California and we'll  get your leg throw over a bike.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, on a day like today, it's a little chilly, I'll take even  Northern California, the coldest place on the planet in the middle of July.   Thank you so much, Sam. </p><p> PASCHEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's really good to see you.  Coming up, final thoughts from our  all-stars. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't know why that song reminds me of Kevin Kelly but it  does.  Final thoughts right now.  Erin, to you first.</p><p> ELMORE:  I drank a whole Starbucks, it's obvious, Frappuccino, so I'm all  juiced up today.  My vote is for Trump to keep yelling as a (INAUDIBLE).   Have a happy weekend.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kevin?</p><p> KELLY:  I'm going to bring -- wear my piano key necktie next time I'm out  here, and also it's important to note that CVS, only 14.5 percent of their  customers use mail order subscription through their pharmacy, Amazon is  coming for you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Lea, final thoughts</p><p> GABRIELLE:  So the Congress, the budget resolution, well, that was due back  in April.  It's almost Halloween, if they get started on next year's now,  then they might get it done by Independence Day.  So I'd say, get it  moving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And here's my final thought to the people in Congress, the GOP  who are writing that house -- that tax reform bill, if you touch 401(k)  plans and make this market tank, you're going to own that, and you will  feel the wrath of President Trump for your remaining days in Congress.  A  big thanks to Erin Elmore, Kevin Kelly, and Lea Gabrielle.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  Mr. Varney starts right now with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p> Stuart, I don't know it if I'm early or late, but it's all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll take it.  I'll take it, Dagen, gratefully.  Thank you very  much indeed, Dagen.  All right.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p>The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p>Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p>Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p>That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p>In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p>And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p>Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p>And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p>KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p>By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p>But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p>That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p>This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p>The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p>So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p>What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p>Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p>So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p>Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p>But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p>I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p>And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p>So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p>Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p>As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p>So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p>Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p>So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p>So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p>I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p>They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p>We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p>And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p>A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p>But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p>So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p>Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p>In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p>Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p>Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p>But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p>KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p>I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p>ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p>ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p>ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p>And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p>And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p>They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p>Joining us now is --</p><p>SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p>What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p>This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p>So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p>Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p>401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p>And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p>And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p>So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p>And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p>Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p>ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p>If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p>XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p>Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p>The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p>The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p>A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p>PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p>Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p>The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p>If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p>And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p>But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p>THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p>There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p>We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p>Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p>And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p>Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p>MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p>TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p>JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p>TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p>Earnings blitz -- big names including Merck, ExxonMobil, Chevron all  reporting this morning.  Merck just hitting the tape, earnings of $1.11 a  share topping estimates while revenue missing expectations.  We see a  little move up to the stocks at least right here right now.</p><p>Budget passed -- the House making the move which is the key to any hope of  tax reform -- that hoping to get done this year.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross praising the passage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think the vote today told  you that they didn't put any amendments at all.  They took it exactly as it  came from the Senate even though they had been talking about quite a few  amendments.</p><p>The only reason they would have had to doing that is to grease the skids  for the tax cuts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting a deal done ahead.</p><p>Futures are showing gains across the board, certainly lifted by some  terrific numbers out of Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet and Amazon  yesterday evening.  Those three stocks in one hour late yesterday adding  about $80 billion in market value.  So we have gains across the board.</p><p>Later this morning, we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing last quarter.  The first reading -- could we get close to 3  percent?  Maybe.</p><p>In Europe, we have gains as well -- buying in England, France and Germany  to wrap up this week.  And it was the same story overnight.</p><p>Stocks ending the week higher in Asia -- Shanghai, Japan, Hong Kong and  South Korea.  </p><p>New details behind the JFK assassination -- the White House allowing the  release of thousands of previously blocked records.  The staggering  revelations including questions over the possible involvement of Russia --  coming up.</p><p>Shocking moments on the road in Ohio.

Not if you're my age.</p><p>Watches for falling prices and restocking robots (ph) -- the devices you  could soon see in the aisle at Wal-Mart.</p><p>Here with me to break it all down this morning, Fox News correspondent Lea  Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly and the  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate Erin Elmore.</p><p>Erin -- good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you, my man.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Loving it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're trying to rock out -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Rocking out on this Friday morning.  I mean especially with  technology killing it.  I mean think about this.  As your sales up 90  percent for Microsoft, Microsoft Office 365 -- revenues up 42 percent.   Technology is 23 percent of the overall markets so it's going to lead --  it's led it higher during the year.  It's going to lead it higher going  into the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen, Mr. Kelly.  Amen.  Coming up this morning New York Stock  Exchange President Tom Farley talks to Maria; Softbank investment adviser  CEO Rajeev Misra; and Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel; actor and director  Kevin Sorbo along with his wife Sam Sorbo.  You don't want to miss any of  those guests.</p><p>To our top story this hour however -- investors looking to earnings this  morning.  Colgate reporting just moments ago.  Earnings per share in line  with estimates at 73 cents; revenue beating expectations at $3.94 billion.   Investors also waiting on the first reading on how fast the economy was  growing last quarter.</p><p>This following the passage of the House budget vote yesterday, a key step  in paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>Joining us now, global economics editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Jon  Hilsenrath.  Jon -- what do you want to start with because earnings are -- </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How about  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- coming in better than expected but again -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- do, does Wall Street -- do investors need that tax reform to  really keep pushing stocks higher here?  Well, I mean I think they're going  to get some kind of tax reform.  We had -- the House passed the budget  yesterday.  That's another step towards completion.</p><p>They have a very aggressive timetable they are setting out in the House to  have a bill done by Thanksgiving.  I mean it's very ambitious but it looks  like they're moving in that direction.</p><p>I think really that's just whipped cream on top of the sundae at this point  because the earnings numbers are so good.  And as you said in your lead up,  you know, we're going to be getting economic growth numbers out tomorrow  and I think they're going to come in pretty strong as well.  We're looking  for something a little bit south of 3 percent; that's after 3.1 percent in  the second quarter.</p><p>The economy is doing pretty well right now.  It isn't gangbusters but it  sure is enough to keep the stock market going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's keeping it going?  Despite -- other than regulatory  reform out of the Trump administration, despite not move by Congress to  really tackle some major issues for the economy namely Obamacare and tax  cuts, tax reform.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, sometimes I think we put too much emphasis on  what's going on in Washington when things are going poorly and when things  are going well.</p><p>Right now, it's the whole world.  What we have is a very unusual  synchronized global upturn.  The European economy has just -- has started  turning up again after spending most of the last decade in a funk.</p><p>The Japanese economy is turning up too -- up again.  You know, we talk to  people there who say their equipment sales are rising because they're  selling more into the United States.</p><p>Emerging markets are picking up.  We have really a sweet spot in the global  economy and big multinational American companies like the tech guys who  reported yesterday are benefiting from it.</p><p>KELLY:  Jon -- are you concerned about the dollar though and the strength  of it?  And should we get higher interest rates going forward?  I mean  you've seen the 10-year tick up.  It's Kevin, by the way.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Are you worried about this global story that you are talking about.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think in a moment like this when the dollar  is strong you have to say -- you have to ask why is it strong?  You know,  why is it picking up?</p><p>We have the dollar picking up because the U.S. economy is in good shape and  because earnings for American companies are there.  So that's good news.   You know, does that, you know, maybe tone down the benefits to the export  sector, yes a little bit.</p><p>But when the global economy is doing well our exporters are going to do  well, too.  So I don't think a strong dollar is a sign of weakness in a  moment like this.  I think it's a sign of strength.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, I want to move on to the Federal Reserve.  I make a list  every morning of things that I think are important to talk about.  And I  made a list and it was earnings and it was the Federal Reserve chief.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump is looking to choose a new Fed chair potentially  when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.  Fox Business' Lou Dobbs sat  down with the President to discuss the candidates.  Watch this and I want  your reaction.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do you have a preference,  out of curiosity.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST:  I do and -- </p><p>TRUMP:  Tell me who your preference is.  I only want that from people I  respect.</p><p>DOBBS:  I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I'll tell you what.  She was in my office three days ago.  She's  very impressive.  I like her a lot.</p><p>In one way I have to say you like to make your own mark.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>TRUMP:  You understand that.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  You like to make your own mark which is maybe one of the things  she's got a little bit against her.  But I think she's terrific.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon -- you've covered the Federal Reserve for years.  You were  the man on the fed that everybody had to listen to.  What do you think?  Do  you have any sense of who the new Fed chief will be?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we spend so much time in the office right now  trying to figure out what's going on inside of Donald Trump's head.</p><p>You know, when you look at clips like when I hear it, I wasn't looking at  it, but when I hear it he sounds like he is very impressed with Janet  Yellen.  And you've got to ask yourself, why would he change horses in the  middle of the race that he's winning right now when growth is picking up,  unemployment is down, stock prices are at record highs.</p><p>But at the same time is he said in that clip with Lou, you know, there  seems to be some desire in the President's head and also inside the White  House to put his own mark on the place, to find his own person.</p><p>So I think -- I think he is really struggling -- not struggling but I think  he is really thinking carefully through this choice and through the pros  and cons of whether to keep her or whether to let her go.  He certainly -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Jon -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- is giving her a close look.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The conventional wisdom is if John Taylor is the next of Fed  chief that he's going to be more aggressive at raising interest rates. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump is a real estate guy.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody in real estate doesn't really like higher interest  rates.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's very fixated on the performance of the stock market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is one reason why I think we've been hammering possible  changes to 401(k) plans.  That's why it resonated with him. He's like why  are you going to mess with something that could cause the market to tank?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>And that brings you back to Janet Yellen.  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The compromise candidate for him is Jay Powell, a governor at  the Fed right now who's basically been right at Janet Yellen's side with  every decision that she's made, you know.</p><p>So you've got to -- you've got to believe that if he picks Jay Powell, he's  getting a Republican.  He's also getting someone who is going to keep  interest rates relatively low.  But then that bring you back to the  question of well, if he's going to bring someone's who's going to look like  Janet Yellen in the policies that he pursues why not just bring back Janet  Yellen?</p><p>You know, we're going to know within the next week.  They say he's going to  make a decision before he leaves for Asia next week.  So we can stop having  this conversation and start talking about whether he made a good decision  or a bad decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon -- good to see you as always.  Jon Hilsenrath -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Sure thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- I love how you said that like you're sitting in the \"Wall  Street Journal\" Washington bureau talking about what's in President Trump's  head.  Don't we all?</p><p>Actually, you know what -- usually -- thank you Jon.  Thinking of that we  don't really need to guess because he will tell -- President Trump will  tell you what's in his head.</p><p>And he just tweeted.  \"Wacky and totally unhinged Tom Steyer who has been  fighting me and my make America great again agenda from the beginning never  wins elections.\"</p><p>For background Steyer is a billionaire who is spending $10 million on a  national ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.  There you  have it.</p><p>More from the President I'm sure on Twitter and we'll bring you that as  soon as it happens.</p><p>Still ahead shedding new light on the shot heard around the world.   Declassified after decades -- we'll delve deeper into the newly released  files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p><p>Plus rolling back prices and rolling out robots -- how Wal-Mart is using  futuristic new technology to keep shelves stocked at dozens of stores  across the country.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news President Trump just tweeting, \"Congratulations to  Speaker Ryan, GOP leader, Steve Scalise and to the Republican Party on  budget passage yesterday.  Now the biggest tax cuts.\"</p><p>I love how he refers to it as tax cuts now.</p><p>The truth coming out -- numerous JFK assassination files have been  released.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest details -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there -- Dagen.  Good morning to  you.  A Red Bull morning here in the nation's capital when you think about  it the 2,800 documents released last night.  These are previously redacted  and classified documents.  And I apologize for all the noise as the leaf  blower goes by here a few times every morning right around the time I talk  to you.</p><p>But let me tell you what happened last night and this is actually a pretty  important story.  It's about the documents related to the assassination of  President Kennedy.</p><p>I think the real headline though would be the fact that many of the records  were withheld due to national security concerns, according to a memo from  the President.</p><p>Now, do keep this in mind.  Those documents contain raw intelligence.   That's uncorroborated and that's likely going to speculate -- or rather  fuel more speculation about the plot to kill the President.  We do learn a  lot about the frustration of FBI chief Herbert Hoover at Cuba's possible  role as well.</p><p>Let me share just a bit of a White House statement.  They talk about those  records that were not released overnight -- 2,800 documents.  Some people  would say it's just a drop in the bucket.  The remaining records will be  released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming  weeks.</p><p>The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from agencies,  directed them to minimize redactions without delay.  And this is an  important one from the CIA -- every single one of the approximately 18,000  remaining CIA records in the collection will ultimately be released with no  document withheld in full.  That is great.  That's a boon if you're a  researcher in particular. </p><p>Now that promise could shed more light about Lee Harvey Oswald, his trips  to Mexico before the assassination and, of course, the Castro regime  including U.S. efforts, by the way, to topple the communist dictator.</p><p>There are a number of days that we are keeping an eye on, Dagen, as we look  forward to the rolling release of these documents.  I want to point your  attention to April 26, 2018.  That's when we expect another big batch.  In  the meantime -- researchers rock on and see what you can find out.</p><p>Back to you with my friend in that bloody leaf blower -- got to love this  guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Leaf blowers are as frightening as chainsaws and louder.  Kevin  -- you did a great job.  It's great to see you.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House.</p><p>Still ahead -- courting Aramco -- the president of the New York Stock  Exchange sitting down with Maria at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia to talk about what they're doing to land potentially the  biggest initial public offering of all-time.</p><p>Then Instagram getting up close and personal -- the dramatic new feature  coming to the social media app.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia our own Maria  Bartiromo was able to sit down with New York Stock Exchange president Tom  Farley and get his take on everything from the Trump effect on the market  to the magnitude of the expected Saudi Aramco IPO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  And joining me right now is the president of  the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE president Tom Farley.  Tom -- it's good  to see you.</p><p>TOM FARLEY, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's great to be back with  you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARLEY:  -- in this beautiful hall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The hall in Saudi Arabia.  It's really incredible to me how  many people in investment management, business people are here in Saudi  this week.</p><p>FARLEY:  Yes.  I mean I was just waiting to sit down with you and impromptu  was able to have a conversation with Secretary Mnuchin, Steve Schwarzman,  Howard Marks.  And it is the great and the good of financing and finance  all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, one of the big reasons obviously is this Saudi  Aramco deal.  They are going to take their state oil company public --  could be the biggest IPO ever.  It could be up to $75 billion.</p><p>You have Alibaba which is what -- a $24 billion deal.  This would be a huge  piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>FARLEY:  So, you know, people see me in the halls here as the head of the  New York Stock Exchange.  Everyone assumes that my relationship is totally  about the Aramco IPO.  I've actually known the -- from the minister level  to the company Saudi Aramco -- I've known the company for many years long  before the IPO was even a notion because as you know the New York Stock  Exchange is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the largest energy exchange  in the world.  I'm one of the managers of that business and Saudi Aramco is  a partner and a customer in that respect.</p><p>Regarding the IPO, we will compete for any IPO of a great global business.   I can't say too much about Saudi Aramco in particular other than anyone you  meet from the company or the ministry -- and I know you've met several of  them just this week.  They are professional.  They are sophisticated.  And  no surprise, they are carrying out a very disciplined, due diligence  process to make the right decision for Saudi Arabia as a whole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think you're going to get the deal.</p><p>FARLEY:  I'm not going to comment in particular because I don't want to  prejudice any decision that they make.  But for any great global IPO, look,  first of all we want them to make the right decision for them.  We won't  try to corner them in to make something we think is a wrong decision.</p><p>Clearly the New York Stock Exchange is the leading exchange in the world  for listings.  We have something like $34 trillion of market caps.  The  next closest exchange is a tiny, tiny fraction of that.</p><p>And so in terms of the deepest liquidity in the world that's in the United  States.  Brand name -- you get that from the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  also a rigorous governance test to be listed in the New York Stock  Exchange.  So if you list there, you're holding yourself out to be a very  well-run, well-governed company.</p><p>That is kind of the decision criteria that benefits what the New York Stock  Exchange brings.  But I have no doubt other exchanges around the world have  their own unique benefits as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the implications of such a huge deal?  I mean if  you're looking at Alibaba being the biggest deal at $24 billion and this  deal is as high as $75 billion, give us a sense.  Give our viewers a sense  of why this is so important and what the global implications are for a  company this size to go public or to sell 5 percent of it to the public?</p><p>FARLEY:  So large IPOs are nerve-racking.  We do them a lot.  Of the top 20  IPOs of all time, I think the number is 13 have been on the New York Stock  Exchange.  And even those companies that fall on the other seven many of  them have ultimately listed in the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>We know a lot about big deals and the New York Stock Exchange is purpose- built for those big deals.  We combine humans and technology but we still  spend a lot of time getting ready for those IPOs because there is a lot of  bids and offers that come in that.  There's a lot of complexity on that  moment the stock opens.  And you need to make sure that stock opens  smoothly so that the management team of the IPO doesn't spend the next six  months or two years explaining what went wrong on IPO day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you what you're seeing right now at the New York  Stock Exchange in terms of listings.  Obviously there has always been a  massive competition between NYSE and Nasdaq.  What can you tell us in terms  of business year-to-date?</p><p>FARLEY:  Well, apropos of our interview location halfway around the world  from our normal home base, our shared home base it's a very global story.   The IPO market is booming in the U.S. and at the New York Stock Exchange.   We've had twice as many roundabouts, twice as many IPOs as all of last  year.  We've had this year twice as much in terms of dollar value and from  all around the world.</p><p>Last week alone we had a great company from Southeast Asia and we had  another company from China.  This week we have an Argentinian company, next  week a Brazilian company.  And so we are seeing great global companies  choosing the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing more global companies relative to the U.S.?   Because the truth is there are a lot of start-ups who are saying, you know  what, I don't want to go public.  The regulatory environment is too tight.   And I'm not going to.</p><p>So that's why there was a problem.  People were wondering why the IPO  market was not so busy earlier this year.  The start-ups were not going  public.  </p><p>FARLEY:  I'm glad you asked that.  You know, the American audience likes to  make a big deal out of a story.  There are not as many American tech  companies going public.  And that's true.  Some of the great American tech  companies have chosen to stay private.</p><p>The last week alone, we had a young man who started a company three years  ago to provide a technology that allows for consumer lending in China --  that company is now worth over $10 billion.  It's an amazing tech story.   And the Friday company, too was a technology company that offers gaming, e- commerce and payments from Singapore.  We just don't talk about it as much  frankly because it's not American.</p><p>But these are great tech companies choosing to go public, choosing the New  York Stock Exchange fortunately.  I'm appreciative that they did choose the  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here is a stat for you -- listed public companies in the  U.S. down 50 percent over 20 years because of the regulatory environment.   I mean the President has said he is calling for IPOs, the bar for IPOs to  be lowered.  </p><p>The Treasury came out with a report. They're basically saying the  regulatory environment is way too hard for companies to go public.</p><p>What are you doing in terms of lowering the bar, in terms of lowering the  standards, making it easier for companies to go public?</p><p>FARLEY:  You know, I think you are referring to our press report that came  out.  And if you work your way down that press report the next paragraph  starts with some of the efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and I  personally have engaged in, to push the administration to make it easier to  engage in IPOs.</p><p>You mentioned the number of public companies.  It is down by about half.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  But the average market cap is up by over three times -- The  aggregate market cap.  So the average company is five or six times bigger.   The public market works great for big companies.  It's not working as well  for small companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p>FARLEY:  And we need to acknowledge that because small companies are the  life blood of free enterprise.  They give the inspiration to even smaller  companies.  They create jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what can you do?  What can you do to get more small  companies to go public then?</p><p>FARLEY:  Simple things.  The pendulum has swung too far on regulation with  Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Big companies can handle it.  Small  companies can't.  So if you can allow the small companies during the IPO  process to meet more with investors and analysts, you can reduce the  Sarbanes-Oxley requirements on small companies.</p><p>Like for example, not require an external audit for the first few years  that a company is public.  And you could extend that to all new companies  not just the tiniest ones but expand the envelope a little bit and have it  be for all new companies that are new to public market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean one thing is create a longer window of time in  which companies can be in the emerging growth category.</p><p>FARLEY:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  Exactly.  And what that emerging market growth category does is it  just requires less regulation for small companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  You know, regulation is like taxes.  No regulation isn't the  answer and complete government control isn't the answer -- somewhere in  between is the right answer, and the pendulum is going to swing.  We have  swung too far towards heavily regulating small companies and we need to  swing it back aggressively to make sure that that IPO engine is there for  those young entrepreneurs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the sentiment feel like to you when you go down on  the floor, when you speak to big investors?  Because how do you like the  way the President is constantly tweeting that market has gained $5.3  trillion in market value since Election Day?  We are at record highs --  23000 and counting.</p><p>Do you feel like things are getting overheated?  Do you feel the same  sentiment when you talk to investors that you did a year ago?</p><p>FARLEY:  I walk in on the floor and I look up at the indices every morning  and it's amazing what has happened since November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't you think?</p><p>FARLEY:  We're 17400 that night, if you remember because the indices really  cratered and now they had zipped back up.  However I will note, it's also a  global story.  This isn't just America.  In the last two weeks alone the  DAX, the CAC, the (INAUDIBLE) -- they have all hit all-time highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>FARLEY:  So there is a really -- this is a really good moment globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you feel like sentiment is still there?  The bullishness  or are people getting worried that things are getting over priced?</p><p>FARLEY:  People are bullish.  That doesn't mean there won't be a pullback  but people are bullish without question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Tom -- it's great to see  you.</p><p>FARLEY:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FARLEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Farley is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up rebuilding Puerto Rico -- 80 percent of the island is  still without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

It involves  zooming and getting in really close.</p><p>And rolling back prices and rolling out some robots.  The futuristic new  tech coming to Walmart to ensure that shelves are always stocked.</p><p>To our stop story this half hour.  The crisis in Puerto Rico.  Two house  committees and a federal watchdog are now investigating the $300 million  no-bid contract that was awarded to Whitefish Energy holdings to repair  Puerto Rico's flattened electrical grid.</p><p>Critics say Whitefish has little experience repairing electricity  infrastructure.  And alleged the company has ties to interior secretary,  Ryan Zinke.</p><p>Joining us now is the spokesman of Whitefish Energy Holdings, Ken Luce.   Ken, what do you say to these investigations?  Are they warranted?</p><p>KEN LUCE, SPOKESMAN, WHITEFISH ENERGY HOLDINGS:  No.  The investigations  are not warranted.  First off, PREPA hired a firm Whitefish Energy who has  extensive experience fixing transmission lines, especially in the  mountains, which is our assignment.  Our assignment is 100 miles of  transmission lines mostly in the mountains of Puerto Rico, which are  necessary to restore the power ultimately overtime.</p><p>The real issue congress should be asking is where are the other firms that  the core and CORE and FEMA are hiring to come to the island to help repair  the grid?  Those contracts were just let last week.  Meaning, it's another  two or three weeks before more help us to the island.  That's the  frustration in Puerto Rico is the resources are not there yet.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And part of the controversy is that  Whitefish only had two full-time employees as reported when Maria hit  Puerto Rico on September 20th and then since hired all these employees.</p><p>You have a pretty robust experience in PR.  When did the company hire you?</p><p>LUCE:  The company hired us two ago.  But again, the point here is the  entire industry ramps up when you get contracts.  Whitefish has experience  in the mountains which is why we were hired.</p><p>If you have a question about that, and the business practice of ramping up  much like homebuilders, consulting firms and others do, look at the results  to date.  320 people are already on the island, lineman and engineers,  repairing the grid.  So if there's a question, then look at the facts.</p><p>My real issue is no one has asked the questions and then reported the  facts.  There's just this jump to say nothing's being done which is  inaccurate.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  What are the facts that you think aren't being reported?</p><p>LUCE:  Well, I mean, the fact you have two employees and you have a  business model that ramps up just like hundreds of firms in the United  States and all over the world.  And you now have 320 employees.</p><p>So if you question a two-person firm with the ability, look at their  experience which is working in mountainous regions and the CEO is leading  that effort in Puerto Rico today and we have 320 people on the ground in  less than three weeks.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Ken.  Erin Elmore here.   There were also allegations -- </p><p>LUCE:  Hi.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi.  How are you?  There were also allegations that interior  secretary, Ryan Zinke's son had an internship at Whitefish.  What do you  say about that?  And is there any correlations there that are troubling?</p><p>LUCE:  No.  He did.  He was a flagger.  So he directed traffic on a summer  job through a friend.  But to say the interior secretary had anything to do  with the contract, number one, it's not true.  Everyone has said so.  He  found out about the contract after it was let.  And he also has no  authority over FEMA, the CORE, PREPA, so again there's a jump today to  guilt versus facts.</p><p>And then the other part of that is, if you really look at the political  landscape in Puerto Rico, an interior secretary and the current  administration would not necessarily be popular in Puerto Rico where the  majority of the population supported the other party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Jen, these investigations aren't going away or at least  inquiries, two health committees, a federal watchdog investigating the  contract, the $300 million, no bid contract.  The governor of Puerto Rico  Rossello, says his administration will soon audit the contract awarded to  Whitefish.  And there's a retired air force colonel appointed to oversee  the reconstruction of the electoral grid following concerns over this very  contract.</p><p>So a lot of eyes on Whitefish now.</p><p>LUCE:  And again, we, welcome them.  Every member of congress should have  the information that they're asking for.  And we will certainly give that  out, but the first thing is, there were no questions asked.  Everybody  jumped to a conclusion based on the \"Washington Post\" article and no one  called.  We reached out to offices before this happened and said, if you  want information, we're more than happy to give it to you.</p><p>The contract with PREPA was done correctly.  PREPA has a company working on  the island and the current administration does not had those resources  there yet.  We welcome it and at the end, I'm just hoping people report  that there was nothing there.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, the director of Puerto Rico's power company has been  quoted saying that part of the reason that Whitefish was selected as the  only company that didn't require a down payment.</p><p>So I wanted to ask.  This does require a lot of money.  So, how well and  how was -- hos is Whitefish finance for this?</p><p>LUCE:  Well, Whitefish is very well capitalized.  They had financing from  several private equity firms.  They have met all their obligations to date.</p><p>But let me go back.  There was a very small deposit.  It was $2 million, I  believe.  There were another firm that also wanted to work, but required 10  to 15 times that amount to begin to work.</p><p>So capitalization isn't an issue.  We have 300 people working on the  island.  We have barges coming over every day.  We're trying to get our  equipment through the ports so that more men and women can come to work and  help Puerto Rico.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ken, thank you so much for being here.  Ken Luce, representing  Whitefish.</p><p>LUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  We'll see you soon.</p><p>Walmart bots roll out.

Actor and director, Kevin Sorbo joining  us with his wife Sam Sorbo, to talk about their new movie shining a light  on the crisis of faith.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hollywood sexual harassment secrets revealed.  Our next guests,  \"Hercules\" actor, Kevin Sorbo, says he too was a victim.  Joining us now is  Kevin and his actress wife, Sam.  They're here to talk about their new  movie.</p><p>But, first, I wanted to talk about -- because you have come out and said  that you -- that Gianni Versace hit on him.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO, AMERICAN ACTOR:  In my book and it happened years ago.  It's  already in my book.  It's not like a secret.  I didn't suffer any trauma  from it but I'm not taking with the people who have, because it's out  there.  Look at them.  I'm a big dude.  Most people in Hollywood aren't  going to -- they're not going to kid on me.  They're afraid of me.</p><p>The most male actors are five-eight.  I'm a big guy.</p><p>SAM SORBO, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  What's amazing is to see now this sorted --  the sorted underbelly of Hollywood coming out.  And we have a film that's  coming out tonight and it's almost the antisepsis of that, right?  Produced  outside of Hollywood with Sean Hannity, as you know.  Not funded by  Hollywood at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fox News Channel, so he -- we have to disclose that.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  He's on the Fox News Channel.  No, it's true and so we're kind  of excited that -- because this film takes a different one.  This is the --  this is the film that Hollywood used to produce.  The uplifting film.  The  film with Godly character.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Prior to the '60s, Hollywood produced, character-driven  movies.  And now, it's changed.  They celebrate antihero.  They celebrate  sort of the negativity in life.  It's just weird to me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think it's a stretch to say this that with Hollywood and  people in that industry broadly speaking that there's a disconnect between  individual and family and faith.</p><p>And that that -- it is largely an industry that is if they don't -- faith  is not front and center if people go to church regularly.  And so, do you  think that that opened the door for greater sexual harassment over decades?   And I'm not naming any individual.  But it's a lack connection to God and  higher power.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  It's actually -- it's a different face.  OK.  If you think of  it as a non-faith -- </p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Every movie is faith-based movie.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  Their face is different.  They put faith in Darwinism and  evolution and survival of the fittest, which is what Harvey Weinstein did.   Survival of the fittest.  He took what he wanted and he got it.  And  sometimes they made him pay for it and he was cool with that.  And it was  business as usual and everybody who knew about it was perfectly fine with  it.  It's a completely different face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You worship at the altar of filth.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Yes.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  And so in our movie, we juxtapose the two, right?  We have two  people who are grieving and one of them worships at the altar of self.   He's basically an egomaniac.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  That's my character.  Yes, he's not a very good guy.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  And his ex-wife.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  But he's a lost man.  He's lost.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  He's lost.  And an ex-wife who is faithful and goes to church  and is raising their two boys in the Christian faith.  And so we juxtapose  the two.  And you can walk it alone or you can walk it with higher power  and you see the difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to watch this clip:  \"Let There Be Light.\"  Opens  nationwide today.  Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM SORBO:  What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of  their brother and using his part of your carnival act?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  It pays the bills.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Daddy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clinically dead in entrance for four minutes.  It's a  miracle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's incredible.  And you wrote it, Sam.  You co-wrote the  script.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  I co-wrote it with Dan Gordon who's a very well-known Hollywood  screenwriter and I was -- I was lucky that he jumped right on board when he  heard the idea.  And then two weeks later, out of the blue Sean calls Kevin  and says.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Sean gave me a call and says, hey, I want to do movie with  you.  I love your got -- what soul-searching movie.  And I said, we got  one.  And we included in the arc and boom.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to put you on the spot.  Is this your favorite project  you've ever worked on?  Especially you work with your wife and she co-wrote  it?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Well, there's questions, one of my favorite ones.  It's in  the top five.  I've done between Hercules and a drama and then -- and then  54 movies.  I've done a lot of work.</p><p>I mean, but I'm very fortunate that I'm still working, because certainly  coming out of the conservative Christian closet in Hollywood for an  industry this of tolerance and freedom of speech, it's pretty much a one- way street with them.  So I've been very lucky to keep working.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  People can go to lettherebelightmovie.com.  They can find out  what theaters it's playing.  And if it's not playing in the theater near  you, I urge people to go, call the theaters or go to the website and  organize group tickets.</p><p>We found that there's a little bit of a threshold, higher thresholds for  faith-based films being booked into theaters.  If they're looking for some  sort of proof, some sort of presales and stuff, that they don't typically  look for in non-faith movies -- </p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Well, that's kind of typical for small independent movies.   It really is that way, if you don't have a big budget to promote.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  The idea with movies is, movies are storytelling.  They shape  the culture.  Hollywood shapes our culture.  Do we want the culture of  Hollywood to trickle down into this culture?  Do we want the culture of  Harvey Weinstein to be pervasive in the U.S. culture?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Kevin.  Are you finding though that people are more  receptive to conservative, more receptive to people who are kind of wear  their faith on the outside as a lot of people and other parts of the  Hollywood?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Let me tell you something.  I travel a lot.  One to airports.   Wherever I'm on streets, cities, no matter where I am, people walk up to me  now, not because of \"Hercules\" and drama, they walk to me because of  (INAUDIBLE) please make more movies like this.</p><p>So if they want to see more movies like this, they have to support them,  because like I said, we don't have the big budget to bring these out there.   And movies like this become successful because of word-of-mouth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam and Kevin Sorbo and you can see -- I'm on \"Outnumbered\"  today.  I'm lucky, guys.  So I'll be very nice.  I promise.  Thank you both  so much.</p><p>Still ahead, exed out.  Apple's iPhone 10 selling out already.  Presales  started earlier today.  When can you get it and how much will you pay?   More head.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  And  it's Friday, October 27th.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Earnings extravaganza, big names including Merck, ExxonMobil,  Chevron, all reporting this morning.  This comes after stellar, earnings  yesterday afternoon from tech giants, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent  Alphabet all delivering better-than-expected results.  Amazon shares  jumping on the news, CEO Jeff Bezos made about $6 billion extra on that  move.  Not the only good news for that retailer, the company gaining  wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states.  The part of driving force  behind CVS making a deal to buy health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66  billion.</p><p>The futures are showing begins across the board this morning.  We have a  32-point gain on the Dow futures, held higher by Microsoft stock again on  those positive earnings and also Intel, two Dow components.  We have gains  across the board.  Later this hour we get the first reading on fast U.S.  economy was growing in the third quarter.  The first reading on third- quarter GDP.  Investors also eyeing key developments out of Washington  including the House passing a budget and we have Exxon earnings coming in  right now.  Looking double beat, 66.17 billion on the revenue line and then  also earnings per share coming in higher as well.  93 cents a share on  Exxon versus an estimate of 86 cents a share.  So, a double beat on Exxon  and, again, those earnings growth in the energy sector from a year ago  gangbusters, so up triple-digit gains on earnings there.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump tweeting on the matter this morning saying, I'll  be talking about the House budget.  Congratulations to Speaker Ryan, GOP  Leader Steve Scalise and Republican Party on budget passage yesterday, now  the biggest tax cuts.  Moving on to new details behind the JFK  assassination, the White House allowing the release of thousands of  previously blocked records, the staggering revelation including a possible  warning nearly 30 minutes ahead of the tragedy.  And iPhone lovers braving  their early morning hours to order the iPhone 10.  The latest as preorders  for the highly-anticipated device go up online.  And Apple needs a winner  because those iPhone 8 sales, the slowest for a new device in years.  </p><p>The greatest of all time taking the wheel, the staggering amount it will  cost you to drive a special edition Aston-Martin designed by really?   Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.  That's right.  What can the man not do?   I'm joking.  And here with me to break it all down, Fox News Correspondent  Lea Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate, Erin Elmore.  Lovely to  be with you.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  I just want to say the Aston-Martin  comes with fully inflated tires.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh, hey yow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get down.</p><p>KELLY:  That's right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the wife in the -- in the passenger seat nagging.  His wife  rather.</p><p>KELLY:  Does she nag?  I haven't heard her say a word ever.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Nag.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  The one thing we didn't say is that Stephanie Pomboy is going to be  here and she is one of our favorite economists especially when it comes to  GDP and she will give coverage and read-throughs that no one else has on  the streets.  She's my favorite person when she comes in.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, you see, here is how it goes every morning since she do  the short show almost like two times a week.  We introduce the panel, and  then we promo the guests.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you just stepped on my promo.</p><p>KELLY:  I know, I know.  But I'm just so excited. </p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I thought I was just sober for coming  on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So he just -- so Kevin just stepped on this promo but we do have  SoftBank investment, Rajeev Misra coming up, SoftBank adviser/CEO, Maria  talked to him yesterday.  Sam Paschel, Zero Motorcycle CEO and \"VARNEY AND  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Don't miss -- and Stephanie Pomboy at the  bottom of the hour.  But busy earning season continues with two big oil  companies reporting.  We just had Exxon earnings hitting the tape, earnings  per share of 93 cents topping expectations.  Revenue also a beat.  Kevin  Kelly, your thoughts on the energy sector because again, this is huge surge  in earnings off the bottom a year -- near the bottom a year ago.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And that highlights the effect of what's really driving the  earning season this year because the energy sector was so depressed when  you think about where oil was even a year ago.  You had 25, 30, $35.00,  $45.00 a barrel of oil.  Now we stayed now consistently above 50 but that  hasn't played through yet.  So one of the interesting aspects is we're  going to want to see what guidance is going forward.  Investors are solely  focused on the effects of the hurricanes that are going to be in Chevron as  well as the Exxon.  What they see going forward where they are in terms of  cost cuts, that's been a very, very big focus for them because a lot of  times, the cost of oil a barrel is higher for a lot of these integrated  when you're thinking Exxon, Chevron, right?  So they're in -- they're all  over the globe, and so because there has been a depression of prices  globally that's affecting them, the last thing is also what they're going  to do M&amp;A wise.  People are worried that they need to start buying  companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory backdrop because we always focus on  Washington and what the Congress hasn't done on health care and taxes but  in terms of the regulation rollback that is something the Trump  administration has been on top of and that does particularly help energy  companies.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  That really helps energy companies and they've even spoken  about that on their investor and conference call all year long.  They're  waiting for actually even more deregulation to happen in the space  especially for them to deploy more of their capital because we've seen coal  as actually done really well this year and the supplies are up and people  are using it more especially with renewable energies and a lot of tax  credits that are flowing through on there.  So a lot -- a lot of policy  coming out of Washington is going to dictate what happens to these  companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google on track  for record highs today.  Amazon stock also getting a boost; Microsoft and  Intel really pushing up the Dow futures this morning.  You look at these  stocks go and Amazon on the news that not just earnings but Amazon is  getting into the pharmacy business or it's gotten approval for wholesale  pharmacy licenses and at least dozens stays.  This comes as the Wall Street  Journal, Kevin, is reporting that giant drugstore chain CVS is in talks to  buy the third largest insurer in the country.  Aetna for $66 billion.  This  CVS deal is in direct response to Amazon, is that right?  What other kinds  of deals could we be looking at in response to Amazon's move into more and  more businesses?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And this really is a shot across the bow because if you think  about what did Amazon do that was of the most significant recently, they  bought Whole Foods, right?  So with getting the state licenses, with  pharmacies can they start distributing -- basically prescription drugs  through their whole partnership and logistics with Whole Foods.  So you see  CVS actually now striking out and looking to do a deal with Aetna and  insurer which they have no experience in.  So this is actually pretty  telling.  We're going to see this story play out over the next couple  quarters, not years.  There is going to be a lot of activity and we're  going to get a lot of activity and we're going to get a lot of direction  that's coming through on that.  And you can see, Amazon is fighting, Wal- Mart toe-to-toe and especially when in the next leg of fight with them is  in the -- is in the prescription drug business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is a huge business.</p><p>ELMORE:  Prices can come way down.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are some drug packages like with Medicare prescription  drug packages packages, the part D that you can only buy prescriptions at  like major pharmacy like you aren't able and allowed to go and buy -- get  prescriptions at smaller like local pharmacy.  You literally have to.   Where I'm from you have to go to Wal-Mart.  It's the only place you can go.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  And the Whole -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again trying to break up that juggernaut.</p><p>KELLY:  And Amazon's idea behind this is the description model.  So people  don't need to continuously go to the pharmacy if they have a physical  presence and then they can get that subscription.  They'll figure out the  delivery and like I said, with their logistic systems that they do have  with Whole Foods.</p><p>ELMORE:  And the delivery is a great idea for people that are homebound or  wheelchair bound, things like that, it's also helping that market, they  really can't help themselves, so I think that's really nice for us people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with this CVS acquisition of Aetna in terms of what it could  potentially do expanding, basically giving a huge number of new customers  through Aetna for its pharmacy benefit management business bolstering its  leverage in negotiation for drug with drug makers in terms of pricing power  and then also you strike deals with -- to tie drug prices to patient  outcomes which is also incredible.  I want to move on to Washington, this  time, it's about truth coming out of D.C.  Numerous JFL assassination filed  released.  Blake Burman is at the White House with the very latest.  Blake,  good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  And this was nearly 2900 additional documents relating to  President Kennedy and his assassination that were produce last night by the  National Archives, not all the documents though within this last batch  though were put forward as the president said in a memo that \"Certain  information should continue to be redacted because of national security,  law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.\"  These newest documents  though do shed more details about the events surrounding the assassination  of JFK.  For example, one shows that a British reporter received a phone  call about 25 minutes before President Kennedy was shot and was told that  there would be impending \"Big news.\"  </p><p>Another detail show an FBI source then claimed days later that the Soviet  Union was fearful that a missile could head their way because of the  actions of an irresponsible U.S. general.  This final batch of the last set  of documents has to be released now by the end of April.  And President  Trump tweeted out moments ago the following, he said and I quote, \"JFK  files are being carefully released.  In the end, there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to the public.\"   For now, Dagen if you need good some good reading, you're just curious or  whatever it might be, all you have to do is head on over to National  Archives Web site, the documents are listed right there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm tempted, I am really tempted when I came out I was  (INAUDIBLE)I got other stuff I need to read.  So yes, weekend reading.   Thank you so much --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN:  It will be there for a while.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  Great to see you as always.   Preorders for the iPhone selling out in just minutes, overnight.  What it  means for anyone trying to get their hands on this hot device.  The release  date is technically November the 3rd but what if you need it before  Christmas or the holidays?  And nobody can drive down the field like Tom  Brady but at least you can drive down the road like the Patriots superstar.   The hot new ride from Aston-martin inspired by the greatest of all time.</p><p>KELLY:  Not.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Preorders for the Apple 10 iPhone starting today but you might  have trouble getting yours in.  Cheryl Casone has more details on this.   Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Hey, Dagen.  Sources saying supplies of the hot  new phone are sold out, shipping estimates slipping well beyond the  November 3rd launch date here in the U.S. on Apple's Web site five to six  weeks right now.  According to one report by the way out in Hong Kong,  they're sold out online with both models of the iPhone 10 currently  unavailable.  That's in that country.  The phone apparently also sold out  on Apple's Web site over in the U.K.  Now this news coming on weak sales of  the iPhone 8 by the way, two research firms saying the 8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  Shares of Apple trading  higher in the premarket higher by more than one percent.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco, Kiko  Alonso nails it, knocks off Flacco's helmet.  And then huge fight ensues  after the hit.  Alonso was given the unnecessary roughest penalty, Alonso  crushing Flacco as he goes for the (INAUDIBLE) Flacco would go straight  into the locker room with a concussion and he would not return to the game.</p><p>Well, let's stay with some football here.  Tom Brady has got a pretty cool  new ride, Aston-Martin selling a special Tom Brady signature edition car.   The luxury convertible for $360,000.  The British sports car usually  associated with 007, it's now going T.V. 12.  Brady's signature is on the  door, on the plates, on the doors, on the T.V. 12 logo.  It's all over the  vehicle basically.  It's on the fender, it's on the headrest.  But if you  want one, keep in mind there's only 12 of these being made.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has launched the zombie  Frappuccino, the drink apparently inspired by an apple dips and caramel,  taste like a tart green apple we are told.  We're going to find out just a  second in our taste tester on set.  Starbucks hoping the drink is going to  -- well, catch on like the uniform Frappuccino which was a huge hit back in  April for the company.  Starbucks, the stock anyway is down about one  percent in the premarket right now.  Stock to watch.  So let's go with  these. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's the verdict?  OK.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I do think it taste like a tart green apple with caramel.  It  really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes.  It's a lot of ones.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ELMORE:  -- together and put in a blender and eat it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheryl, technically if it's a zombie Frappuccino, wouldn't it  taste like rotting flesh?</p><p>CASONE:  No.  Well, you know, you would think so, Dagen, but I don't think  that's what they're going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>KELLY:  You also like to know what rotting flesh tastes like, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p>CASONE:  The pink whipped cream is supposed to be the brains, OK?  The red  mocha drizzle is blood obviously.  It might gross you out. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  No, but, you know, by the way, you have to like kind of drink them  quick, because once they kind of -- the mixed up basically they're saying  like you -- once you order these, like don't like hold on to it because it  -- and then it gets kind of funky color.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Slurpy same thing happens. </p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.  Slurpy, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, paving the way for a public debut.  Maria, sitting  down with a top name from SoftBank to top about the timeline for a possible  Uber IPO. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you, ESPN reporting that Alibaba co- founder Joseph Tsai has reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49  percent minority stake The Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets worth $1.8 billion by  the latest valuation according to Forbes Magazine.  So, the Nets --</p><p>KELLY:  That's the Chinese and the Russians together now owning the Nets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I still not go to games.  Where can you find value in this  market?  Maria Bartiromo sat down with SoftBank investment adviser Rajeev  Misra in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where she asked him just that.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  You are $100-billion vision fund is dominating  conversations across the world, congratulations -- </p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISE, SOFTBANK:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the performance as well.  Tell us how you're allocating  capital.  Where are the growth opportunities in the world today? </p><p>MISRA:  Group opportunities are everywhere but it's concentrated with  entrepreneurial equal system exist and that's primarily in two locations,  China and U.S. If you look at our fund and we have two pools of capital in  SoftBank.  The vision fund which a hundred billion, plus SoftBank group  itself which makes a lot of technology and investment off this balance  sheet.  We own -- we bought the ARM last year, we have Sprint, and SoftBank  Mobile, we have 28 percent stake in Alibaba that also has grown in value  and so there are two pools of capital.  But almost half our investments are  going into U.S. 50 odd billion, a lot chunk will be in China where there's  a large population-based and there they are leapfrogging technology to  include a large part of the population hence from ride-sharing companies  like Didi to bicycle-sharing that go for food delivery, et cetera, et  cetera is very exciting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you.</p><p>MISRA:  No, Uber is not looking to take 10 billion from us, they will get a  billion -- a billion and one half as primary investment.  There is  potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity to shareholders and  employees who are early investors to sell secondary shares to SoftBank and  we are late-stage discussions to potentially buy some secondary shares from  early investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the valuations, is it harder today to find  value which is also a growth story?  I mean, obviously, Alibaba has been an  incredible performer for you, but when you look elsewhere, is there another  Alibaba out there?  </p><p>MISRA:  There may not be Alibaba but we make a thousand times in return but  we vested Nvidia nine months ago, we bought five percent of Nvidia for --  close to $3 billion, it's worth six billion in nine months.  So you don't  have to find just Alibaba to make good investments.  We are going through a  technology revolution as we speak in every aspect of human life, from food  delivery to life sciences to as I said insurance, to selling used cars, to  selling homes, to buy -- getting a mortgage, to so far getting us to loan,  every aspect of life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everything is the sharing economy.  </p><p>MISRA:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right? </p><p>MISRA:  So there is plenty of opportunities.  Valuation is not an issue if  you find the right companies that are market leaders, that have the right  entrepreneur and management, to scale, to go global, this is what SoftBank  helps with and we are a consumer company too.  We have 35 million  subscribers with Sprint, with 35 million subscribers in SoftBank Mobile in  Japan, et cetera.  And getting these companies to work with each other,  learning from each other, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  A ride- sharing companies in India Ola learns a lot from Didi in China from their  experiences and vice versa.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Telecom has been really critical for you.  Why is Telecom sort  of the underlying important, you know, backdrop of some of your  investments? </p><p>MISRA:  There are four factors that are shaping the technology revolution.   First, processing power, the ability to process and the cost of processing  has gone through phenomenal scale where your iPhone today can process  cheaper and faster than mainframe 15 years ago or a laptop computer 10  years ago, data, second.  Ability to collect data and able to process the  data which is driving (INAUDIBLE) in media which is called the graphic  processing unit and ability to structure large and analyze large  unstructured data pools and make sense out of it and predict outcomes and  predict consumer behavior, managing inventory and be able to analyze that  kind of data.  So data -- ability of collecting data and having access to  data is a second factor.  Processing data software to analyze it and  lastly, Telecom speed and cost of Telecom.  Look at 10 years ago, there  were no smartphones.  Smartphones came in 2007.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now can't live without them.  </p><p>MISRA:  And we can't live without them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>MISRA:  And the ability to have that kind of processing power in your car,  in your smartphone, in your house, so on.  Telecom speed is important for  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) Let me ask you about A.I. and the worry there.   People are wondering what skill set do I need to drive in this new world.   A.I. means robotics machine learning.  Are we going to have more robots  than humans?  Are they going to take human's jobs?.  </p><p>MISRA:  We already have a lot of robots, car is a robot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  True.</p><p>MISRA:  You know, a robot doesn't have to walk and speak, I mean, they're  kind of bots and robots.  A phone --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, should we be afraid of it?  </p><p>MISRA:  Not at all.  You have more -- you have robots today versus 10 years  ago.  You have all these cars that robots, your iPhone is a robot, et  cetera, et cetera.  They only would make -- enable your life a lot better.   They will provide healthcare services better, they will make your  entertainment better, you can listen to music, your wristwatch, your  tracker, but what skills the young needs to know and learn is there's so  much learn by -- you don't have to be a computer programmer to be -- to be  successful in this -- in the next generation.  You need to learn -- you  need to go to China, you need to go to India, see what -- all you need to  do is take what's successful in one part of the world and take it to  another.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Rajeev, it's great to have you on the program today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>MISRA:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The first reading on third-quarter GDP on the other  side of this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  3.0 percent, that's how fast the U.S. economy was growing, this  is the first reading on the third quarter gross domestic product, it's our  biggest measure, most important measure of how the overall U.S. economy is  doing.  The expectation was for 2-1/2 percent, they're about to get three  percent and see that nice three number in the front of GDP growth.  It is  kind of exciting if you want the U.S. to do well.  Joining us now is one of  our favorites guest of all time, MacroMavens president, Stephanie Pomboy.   Stephanie, just your initial take on this three percent reading, how is it  that we're growing at a three percent growth? </p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Wow.  Well, you know, I'm  surprised, I want to see the details in terms of the inventory contribution  versus the consumer spending because obviously what we care about is seeing  strong spending rather than just some inventory bill.  And I know that at  least the Atlanta fed and they're, therefore, had built in almost a full  percentage point contribution from inventories largely due from hurricanes  that we saw.  So that will be interesting to look at but as you know, you  know, my concern has been that there's been a broad deceleration in growth,  not that the wheels are off but that in a way it been general turning  downward this highways a little bit.  Since 2015, I've seen slowing tax  receipts, actually, treasury tax receipts are now down year and year which  is a recession reading.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>POMBOY:  So there's some things that just don't square with the strength of  the headlined numbers and I'm very interested to find out, you know, what  the details here are.  The other thing we're seeing that's a little is  disturbing kind of conflicts with the strong headline spending in GDP  numbers are the rise and the delinquencies.  So, there are couple things  out there that have me concerned and this is why I'm so anxious to see the  tax cuts come through because we need to pass this baton from monetary to  fiscal policy and get some more (INAUDIBLE) into the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think this three percent though gives Congress more --  that they think, the economy is doing OK, there is no urgency? That's my  worry.  </p><p>POMBOY:  That's the danger, exactly.  I mean, I'm -- since I'm looking at  thing like tax receipts and delinquencies and, you know, the slowing  consumer discretionary spending, I'm worried, you know, I'm sitting here  biting nails like they've got to get this done fast.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I'm glad you brought up tax receipts because I'm extremely  worried because the Fed keeps saying we haven't had inflation but they're  looking at the wrong indicators.  Look at asset inflation, it's been  unbelievable, look at health care, the price of health care has gone up  exponentially.  The price of getting a college education has gone up  significantly.  So when they're talking about the PCE and they're talking  about CPI, those are all just like, you know, areas for them to deflect.   Asset inflation they've even been worried about.  Now, do you see headwinds  coming about because now we're at -- I'm looking where recession highs for  the dollar, 10-year yields are going up.  I mean, do you see that this  could be the only two-quarter GDP for that we get that's good given the  headwinds?  </p><p>POMBOY:  Well, this is what I worry about, you know, I'm glad you talked  about the rising cost of health care intuition, housing expenses have gone  up a lot in the couple of years.  So if you strip out housing in health  care, you know, that's 40 percent of the increasing in consumer spending.   So discretionary spending as I said, you know, has been slowing and  actually, people are now relying more on credit cards and transfer payments  to, you know, cover their everyday necessities.  So I think it's a major  issue and then you've got the Fed doing Q.T. which isn't going to help in  terms of, you know, tightening credit conditions, et cetera.  So this is  why again, I come back to the urgency of really getting these tax cuts  through and getting some relief because right now, clearly the trend toward  decelerating growth notwithstanding this current GDP, the third quarter is,  you know, going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is the best six-month stretch since mid-2014 for the  economy in terms of GDP, and the commerce department said that this was  particularly interesting or strong, because of the hurricane.  We were  still able to grow at three percent for the quarter.  And this is the first  reading, it could be revised downward or upward, but, again, it was  particularly spectacular for that reason because of the weather.  </p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I think the things to watch going forward is what's  happening obviously on the consumer spending front, like you said, you  know, I think some of the data actually, the monthly data had been  surprisingly strong over that hurricane period.  We did see yesterday,  retail inventories were much weaker though when you saw auto inventories  thankfully, you know, post their largest decline since the recession and  that's sort of a silver lining of this hurricane, and you might have  provided all these producers some relief on the inventory front because  they've been dealing with very high -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, here we go.  Consumer spending gain was driven by motor  vehicles as Americans replaced cars damaged by the storms and then services  spending by contrast flow to its weakest since 2013, so that goes into your  kind of discretionary spending outside of housing and health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about inventories and --  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I'm pulling that out.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Can I ask you real quick about the  Fed and the plan to unwind balance sheets the Fed, what risk do you see in  terms of future GDP from that?  </p><p>POMBOY:  Well, I think we are credit dependent economy, you know, I always  talk about how it's the car basically, and credit is the fuel that gets it  going, and we've actually reached the point where we rely -- we're getting  worse mileage basically, we need gas in the tank go each additional GDP  mile.  So if you're to start to reduce the supply of fuel in the economy,  the credit fuel which is what the Fed is basically going to do but natural  tendency of the economy is going to be to grow with a slower rate.  And  we're already, you know, in the deceleration phase and the interesting  thing on that too is bank credits, total bank lending has already rolled  over sharply ahead of Q.T.  So, we haven't gone to see the real Fed  tightening and yet credit conditions are already starting to slow down.  So  this again, you know, just underscore why I'm really focused on the tax  cuts because, you know, we got to pass the baton from monetary to fiscal  policy, and right now, you know, it's a nail-biter.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And trading inventories added a combined 1.14 to the growth.  </p><p>POMBOY:  OK.  Yes.  It was supposed to add about .8, so that's a  substantially larger ad.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So real final sales been were one-six.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So that's not, you know, that's not from 2.9 last quarter.  That's  a pretty big slowdown.  So -- anyway, totally we'll get this tax cut.</p><p>POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) in the --</p><p>KELLY:  Real economy.</p><p>POMBOY:  In the real economy.  That would be nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stephanie, it's so good to see you always.  Because you all --  every time we talk to you, you always tell us something that we don't know  and it's just a different --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, that's my job.  I think, you know, let's focus on the stuff  these people are focused on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some people kind of tell you what you've already heard 800  times.  Not you, Stephanie Pomboy.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>POMBOY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have a great weekend.  Big oil in focus this morning as well,  Exxon and Chevron reporting earnings, both companies topping expectations.   Joining us now is price futures group senior market analyst, fox business  contributor, Mr. Phil Flynn.  Mr. Flynn, what do you see in these earnings?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  We're  putting the big back in big oil.  How about that?  I mean, these are  companies that a couple years ago were given up for dead, ExxonMobil used  to be the biggest energy company in the world, moved down to number four,  Chevron, of course, had some major problems with earnings, but what a  comeback right now, especially if you look at ExxonMobil, what an amazing  earnings quarter when you consider the fact that their entire refining  operation on Gulf Coast was under water last quarter.  </p><p>They're saying that their earnings would have been even better, you know,  four cents better if it weren't for that situation.  So we're seeing  something going on that's reflected not only in oil prices but in the GDP.   You know, sometimes this comeback in oils really reflective of what we've  been seeing in the economy and the economy that's recovering not only here  but around the globe, and that's why I'm really excited about big oil and  big earnings because that means the economy is feeling, demand for oil and  natural gas is going up, that means people are working so this is great  news for the economy today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil, great to see you as always.  Phil Flynn.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Coming up.  An electrifying performance from tech.   Stuart Varney weighing in on the huge gains from industry giants like  Amazon, Microsoft, Google.  And is the key to getting back on track going  off the rails?  Why General Electric is said to be considering an exit from  its railroad business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Titans of tech, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are they more  powerful than we thought?  Joining me now with his thoughts, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Even more powerful than we thought.  Well, yes, I  guess they are. I mean, turning in a performance like that yesterday  afternoon, those profit gains and now the stock price gains, I mean, for  those of you who are listening too what's on the radio, let me read this  out.  Amazon is $81.00 a share, Microsoft is up $5.00 a share, that's about  seven percent by the way, and Alphabet up is $43.00 per share.  Did anybody  see this coming?  I didn't.  I don't know about these analysts but I  certainly didn't, that was an absolutely blowout performance.  And it  extends the power of the American technology into whole new industries.   Why CVS is looking at Aetna, a corner drugstore with a health insurer, why?   Because Amazon is just around the corner coming on strong when may be the  delivery prescription drugs.  They are everywhere, these five technology  companies, they're just astonishing and quite frankly, Dagen, I am blown  away by it, period.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, because the decision if you're an investor, it literally  -- and we have talked about this for years.  It literally comes down to do  I want to own a piece of a great American business that's getting even big  -- bigger that is dominating a variety of fields or do I want to lend Uncle  Sam the Federal government, money for 10 years, and only get paid less than  2-1/2 percent in yield because that's really the decision if you're buying  a treasury versus a stock.  </p><p>VARNEY:  That's right.  Let's weigh this up, shall we? Do I join the  marking global economy and buy into technology stock and then my money goes  through the roof or do I lend -- as you say, lend to Uncle Sam and get me  two percent?  Which do I do?  OK.  I'm dead safe with Uncle Sam, I got it  but I'm going nowhere.  I'm taking a risk with technology, but I'm going  somewhere.  As for putting new money in now, that I'm not so sure of.  I'm  going to hold off on that, but as everybody knows, I do I own some  Microsoft and my point today is I'm not selling at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think Satya Nadella of Microsoft makes better decisions  with your money or Congress?  We already pay taxes, that's -- I know that's  a little simplistic but I always think -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VARNEY:  No, it's a loaded question.  That's what it is.  You know where  I'm coming from too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're fantastic each and every day.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart is coming up in almost exactly 15 minutes.  A reminder,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Three whole hours of  Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p>The first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter coming  in much better than expected.  Nicole Petallides on floor at the New York  Stock Exchange.  Hey, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good Friday morning, Dagen.  Yes, that's  right.  We're seeing the economy here in the U.S. in the latest quarter  grow faster than expected, at three percent rate faster than the 2.5  percent rate that was expected.  Why did that happen?  That was consumer  and also business spending that helped it along and that's why you did see  that growth there despite Harvey and Irma.  </p><p>Taking a look at Futures right now, up 17 points for the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  We'll see if we can make some records today.  Taking a  look at Merck, though, Dow component, Merck, that is to the downside this  morning, sales dropped three percent overall.  It did very well with  KEYTRUDA.  That is their U.S. long -- that's a cancer patient -- U.S.  cancer -- lung cancer and that really helped them along but not enough to  break through.  Stock down 2-1/2 percent, profit beat, they raised the  outlook but a sales miss overall.  </p><p>Then there's Colgate-Palmolive, so that was relatively flat.  Let's take a  look at that.  It did ramp up ad spending, about 20 percent ramped that up,  and that cut into the numbers.  That is down one-third of one percent.  And  good old G.E., well, G.E., of course, you know, we reported recently how  it's dropped out of the dividend portfolio for Morgan Stanley.  Well, now,  they're exiting and saying that they want to exit out of the railroad  business.  Just not seeing the demand, it is a seasonal business, it is --  is it inconsistent, and they have so many others from aviation to power,  health care, just to name some.</p><p>So, this morning, we're seeing it up one-quarter of one percent, but we did  see those new lows as to -- on 10.26 of 21.20.  We're not too far off of  that, so people are holding to this one for the long term, they've been  ultimately very disappointed, and there is talk (INAUDIBLE) outlook they  might be cutting the dividend, too.  And that's why Morgan Stanley,  ultimately, tried to pull them out of that portfolio for wealth management  because it's not really what they're looking for big picture.  </p><p>We have much more, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, coming up right after this, happy  Friday to you.  Keep it here on Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If Tesla wants to revolutionize how we drive, Zero Motorcycles  who wants to take your love of the road to the next level.  No noise, no  vibrations, but all the power and torque of the best bikes out there.  It's  electric and it's the next great American brand, completely made in the  United States.  Joining me now, is Zero Motorcycles' CEO, Sam Paschel.   Tell me about the bike, Sam, because I'm a Harley fan, that's a regular  old-fashioned and internal combustion engine.</p><p>SAM PASCHEL, ZERO MOTORCYCLES CEO:  It is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is not anything like that.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It is.  This is -- it's the most innovative motorcycle in the  world.  If you're familiar with a Harley, something like a Harley Sportster  1200.  Will have about 73 foot-pounds of torque.  That's basically how much  force is being applied to that back tire to really give you the  acceleration.  Zero Motorcycles -- the bike right in front of us has about  116 foot-pounds of torques.  So, you're getting the acceleration and  performance out of a, like a modern day superbike out of one of these  electric motorcycles.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you going after the audience that Harley Davidson goes  after?  What's your key demographic?  </p><p>PASCHEL:  The key demographics, we have three basic types of riders that  make up the majority of who we reach out to.  First, we have riders that  tend to have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  You know, the  electric motorcycle phenomenon, electric vehicles overall are still pretty  new.  In 2011, there were about 2,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States overall, four wheels, two wheels, everything else.  Flash forward it  last year, and there were about 160,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States and about 780,000 globally.  So, this phenomenon is catching on.   But within the motorcycle community, it's still relatively new.  So, the  three types of riders we generally get are riders who have a quiver of  bikes that have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  We get new riders,  people, that don't have that established connection with any one brand.   And throw a leg over a Zero and just fall in love with it.  </p><p>And three, and actually, probably the most common, we have riders who love  motorcycle riding at one point in their life, and then for one reason or  another, had a family, had kids, moved away from it, and now it's the lure  of electric and the differentiated ride that's really drawing them back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been on a Harley or eight in my days, and these bikes, they  don't have the roar and the rumble of a Harley that Harley riders and  devotees really crave.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It's true.  It's true.  If you think about riding a motorcycle,  and you've been on one, it's a -- it's an experience that uses all five  senses.  Three of those senses on an electric motorcycle are going to be  completely different than they are on a gas bike.  First, as you mentioned,  is the -- is the audio, the sound.  You're not going to have that same  rumble.  You're not going to have that same sense of sound.  You're going  to hear your surroundings a lot better.  You can hear what's going on  around you but you're not going to have that roar.</p><p>Number two, the smell and the fumes of a gas bike aren't really going to be  there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is my cologne.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Which is your cologne.  It's not mine today.  It's not mine  today.  It's the reason -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  -- I'm stepping on further way.  But third, and I think most  important is all the -- all the vibration that you tend to feel with the  gas bike, you don't feel with an electric motorcycle.  So the only thing  you're really feeling is your connection to the road and the ride.  For me  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  These are made in the United States, made in America just like  the Harley, so is that a selling point, too.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It's a huge point for our consumers.  The bikes have been  engineered from the ground up, designed and are all built in the bay area,  in Northern California.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How -- what are your sales like year-over-year, how much are  they growing?</p><p>PASCHEL:  They were growing in about a 35 percent compound annual growth  rate.  It's similar to what's happening in the E.V. space.  And two  dynamics at play, one, is a motorcycle market that tends to be a bit flat.   The second is an E.V. market that's growing rapidly.  Luckily for us, we're  tending to follow a curved of the E.V. market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about other products that you might be looking at outside  of motorcycles?</p><p>PASCHEL:  So, we have -- we have three basic business segments.  The first  is the commercial motorcycles which are for sale to consumers and  motorcycles for us --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I interviewed the founder of the company years ago when the  first bikes were rolling out.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Yes.  Neal was fantastic; he was a NASA-funded engineer at one  point, and a mountain bike and a motorcycle enthusiast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  The second segment for us is fleets and military.  It's a great  application for local police forces.  And third is this powertrain  business, where their companies that realize they're a little bit behind  the curve on electrification, we've got millions of miles underneath the  bikes, we've got 11 years of experience and they're coming to us to help  them electrify the products that they have already created. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam, good to see you.  Please come back.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  Thanks so much for having us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wish I would get on one but -- I'm not wearing my motorcycle  pants today.  Sam Paschel, thank you so much.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Thank you so much.  (INAUDIBLE) come out to California and we'll  get your leg throw over a bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, on a day like today, it's a little chilly, I'll take even  Northern California, the coldest place on the planet in the middle of July.   Thank you so much, Sam. </p><p>PASCHEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really good to see you.  Coming up, final thoughts from our  all-stars. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know why that song reminds me of Kevin Kelly but it  does.  Final thoughts right now.  Erin, to you first.</p><p>ELMORE:  I drank a whole Starbucks, it's obvious, Frappuccino, so I'm all  juiced up today.  My vote is for Trump to keep yelling as a (INAUDIBLE).   Have a happy weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin?</p><p>KELLY:  I'm going to bring -- wear my piano key necktie next time I'm out  here, and also it's important to note that CVS, only 14.5 percent of their  customers use mail order subscription through their pharmacy, Amazon is  coming for you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lea, final thoughts</p><p>GABRIELLE:  So the Congress, the budget resolution, well, that was due back  in April.  It's almost Halloween, if they get started on next year's now,  then they might get it done by Independence Day.  So I'd say, get it  moving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And here's my final thought to the people in Congress, the GOP  who are writing that house -- that tax reform bill, if you touch 401(k)  plans and make this market tank, you're going to own that, and you will  feel the wrath of President Trump for your remaining days in Congress.  A  big thanks to Erin Elmore, Kevin Kelly, and Lea Gabrielle.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  Mr. Varney starts right now with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p>Stuart, I don't know it if I'm early or late, but it's all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll take it.  I'll take it, Dagen, gratefully.  Thank you very  much indeed, Dagen.  All right.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p> The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p> Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p> Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p> That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p> In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p> And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p> Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p> And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p> All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p> KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p> By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p> But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p> The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p> That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p> This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p> The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p> So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p> What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p> Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p> So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p> Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p> But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p> I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p> And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p> So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p> Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p> As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p> So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p> Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p> So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p> So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p> I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p> They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p> We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p> And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p> A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p> But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p> So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p> Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p> In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p> Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p> Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p> Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p> But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p> KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p> I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p> ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p> ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p> ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p> ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p> And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p> And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p> KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p> They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p> Joining us now is --</p><p> SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p> What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p> This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p> So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p> Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p> 401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p> And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p> And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p> So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p> And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p> MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p> Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p> ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p> If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p> XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p> Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p> The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p> GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p> THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p> The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p> A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p> PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p> Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p> The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p> If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p> THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p> And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p> But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p> THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p> There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p> We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p> Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p> And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p> Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p> CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p> MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p> TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p> JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p> TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p> Earnings blitz -- big names including Merck, ExxonMobil, Chevron all  reporting this morning.  Merck just hitting the tape, earnings of $1.11 a  share topping estimates while revenue missing expectations.  We see a  little move up to the stocks at least right here right now.</p><p> Budget passed -- the House making the move which is the key to any hope of  tax reform -- that hoping to get done this year.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross praising the passage.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think the vote today told  you that they didn't put any amendments at all.  They took it exactly as it  came from the Senate even though they had been talking about quite a few  amendments.</p><p> The only reason they would have had to doing that is to grease the skids  for the tax cuts.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting a deal done ahead.</p><p> Futures are showing gains across the board, certainly lifted by some  terrific numbers out of Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet and Amazon  yesterday evening.  Those three stocks in one hour late yesterday adding  about $80 billion in market value.  So we have gains across the board.</p><p> Later this morning, we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing last quarter.  The first reading -- could we get close to 3  percent?  Maybe.</p><p> In Europe, we have gains as well -- buying in England, France and Germany  to wrap up this week.  And it was the same story overnight.</p><p> Stocks ending the week higher in Asia -- Shanghai, Japan, Hong Kong and  South Korea.  </p><p> New details behind the JFK assassination -- the White House allowing the  release of thousands of previously blocked records.  The staggering  revelations including questions over the possible involvement of Russia --  coming up.</p><p> Shocking moments on the road in Ohio.  The details after a 10-year-old lead  police on a high-speed chase that topped 110 miles per hour.</p><p> And are you ready for your close up?  The new feature Instagram hopes will  be a supersized success.  Not if you're my age.</p><p> Watches for falling prices and restocking robots (ph) -- the devices you  could soon see in the aisle at Wal-Mart.</p><p> Here with me to break it all down this morning, Fox News correspondent Lea  Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly and the  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate Erin Elmore.</p><p> Erin -- good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you, my man.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Loving it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're trying to rock out -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Rocking out on this Friday morning.  I mean especially with  technology killing it.  I mean think about this.  As your sales up 90  percent for Microsoft, Microsoft Office 365 -- revenues up 42 percent.   Technology is 23 percent of the overall markets so it's going to lead --  it's led it higher during the year.  It's going to lead it higher going  into the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amen, Mr. Kelly.  Amen.  Coming up this morning New York Stock  Exchange President Tom Farley talks to Maria; Softbank investment adviser  CEO Rajeev Misra; and Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel; actor and director  Kevin Sorbo along with his wife Sam Sorbo.  You don't want to miss any of  those guests.</p><p> To our top story this hour however -- investors looking to earnings this  morning.  Colgate reporting just moments ago.  Earnings per share in line  with estimates at 73 cents; revenue beating expectations at $3.94 billion.   Investors also waiting on the first reading on how fast the economy was  growing last quarter.</p><p> This following the passage of the House budget vote yesterday, a key step  in paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> Joining us now, global economics editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Jon  Hilsenrath.  Jon -- what do you want to start with because earnings are -- </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How about  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- coming in better than expected but again -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- do, does Wall Street -- do investors need that tax reform to  really keep pushing stocks higher here?  Well, I mean I think they're going  to get some kind of tax reform.  We had -- the House passed the budget  yesterday.  That's another step towards completion.</p><p> They have a very aggressive timetable they are setting out in the House to  have a bill done by Thanksgiving.  I mean it's very ambitious but it looks  like they're moving in that direction.</p><p> I think really that's just whipped cream on top of the sundae at this point  because the earnings numbers are so good.  And as you said in your lead up,  you know, we're going to be getting economic growth numbers out tomorrow  and I think they're going to come in pretty strong as well.  We're looking  for something a little bit south of 3 percent; that's after 3.1 percent in  the second quarter.</p><p> The economy is doing pretty well right now.  It isn't gangbusters but it  sure is enough to keep the stock market going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What's keeping it going?  Despite -- other than regulatory  reform out of the Trump administration, despite not move by Congress to  really tackle some major issues for the economy namely Obamacare and tax  cuts, tax reform.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, sometimes I think we put too much emphasis on  what's going on in Washington when things are going poorly and when things  are going well.</p><p> Right now, it's the whole world.  What we have is a very unusual  synchronized global upturn.  The European economy has just -- has started  turning up again after spending most of the last decade in a funk.</p><p> The Japanese economy is turning up too -- up again.  You know, we talk to  people there who say their equipment sales are rising because they're  selling more into the United States.</p><p> Emerging markets are picking up.  We have really a sweet spot in the global  economy and big multinational American companies like the tech guys who  reported yesterday are benefiting from it.</p><p> KELLY:  Jon -- are you concerned about the dollar though and the strength  of it?  And should we get higher interest rates going forward?  I mean  you've seen the 10-year tick up.  It's Kevin, by the way.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Are you worried about this global story that you are talking about.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think in a moment like this when the dollar  is strong you have to say -- you have to ask why is it strong?  You know,  why is it picking up?</p><p> We have the dollar picking up because the U.S. economy is in good shape and  because earnings for American companies are there.  So that's good news.   You know, does that, you know, maybe tone down the benefits to the export  sector, yes a little bit.</p><p> But when the global economy is doing well our exporters are going to do  well, too.  So I don't think a strong dollar is a sign of weakness in a  moment like this.  I think it's a sign of strength.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, I want to move on to the Federal Reserve.  I make a list  every morning of things that I think are important to talk about.  And I  made a list and it was earnings and it was the Federal Reserve chief.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump is looking to choose a new Fed chair potentially  when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.  Fox Business' Lou Dobbs sat  down with the President to discuss the candidates.  Watch this and I want  your reaction.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do you have a preference,  out of curiosity.</p><p> LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST:  I do and -- </p><p> TRUMP:  Tell me who your preference is.  I only want that from people I  respect.</p><p> DOBBS:  I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I'll tell you what.  She was in my office three days ago.  She's  very impressive.  I like her a lot.</p><p> In one way I have to say you like to make your own mark.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> TRUMP:  You understand that.</p><p> DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p> TRUMP:  You like to make your own mark which is maybe one of the things  she's got a little bit against her.  But I think she's terrific.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon -- you've covered the Federal Reserve for years.  You were  the man on the fed that everybody had to listen to.  What do you think?  Do  you have any sense of who the new Fed chief will be?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we spend so much time in the office right now  trying to figure out what's going on inside of Donald Trump's head.</p><p> You know, when you look at clips like when I hear it, I wasn't looking at  it, but when I hear it he sounds like he is very impressed with Janet  Yellen.  And you've got to ask yourself, why would he change horses in the  middle of the race that he's winning right now when growth is picking up,  unemployment is down, stock prices are at record highs.</p><p> But at the same time is he said in that clip with Lou, you know, there  seems to be some desire in the President's head and also inside the White  House to put his own mark on the place, to find his own person.</p><p> So I think -- I think he is really struggling -- not struggling but I think  he is really thinking carefully through this choice and through the pros  and cons of whether to keep her or whether to let her go.  He certainly -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Jon -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- is giving her a close look.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The conventional wisdom is if John Taylor is the next of Fed  chief that he's going to be more aggressive at raising interest rates. </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump is a real estate guy.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anybody in real estate doesn't really like higher interest  rates.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  No.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's very fixated on the performance of the stock market.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is one reason why I think we've been hammering possible  changes to 401(k) plans.  That's why it resonated with him. He's like why  are you going to mess with something that could cause the market to tank?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> And that brings you back to Janet Yellen.  So -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  The compromise candidate for him is Jay Powell, a governor at  the Fed right now who's basically been right at Janet Yellen's side with  every decision that she's made, you know.</p><p> So you've got to -- you've got to believe that if he picks Jay Powell, he's  getting a Republican.  He's also getting someone who is going to keep  interest rates relatively low.  But then that bring you back to the  question of well, if he's going to bring someone's who's going to look like  Janet Yellen in the policies that he pursues why not just bring back Janet  Yellen?</p><p> You know, we're going to know within the next week.  They say he's going to  make a decision before he leaves for Asia next week.  So we can stop having  this conversation and start talking about whether he made a good decision  or a bad decision.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon -- good to see you as always.  Jon Hilsenrath -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Sure thing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- I love how you said that like you're sitting in the \"Wall  Street Journal\" Washington bureau talking about what's in President Trump's  head.  Don't we all?</p><p> Actually, you know what -- usually -- thank you Jon.  Thinking of that we  don't really need to guess because he will tell -- President Trump will  tell you what's in his head.</p><p> And he just tweeted.  \"Wacky and totally unhinged Tom Steyer who has been  fighting me and my make America great again agenda from the beginning never  wins elections.\"</p><p> For background Steyer is a billionaire who is spending $10 million on a  national ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.  There you  have it.</p><p> More from the President I'm sure on Twitter and we'll bring you that as  soon as it happens.</p><p> Still ahead shedding new light on the shot heard around the world.   Declassified after decades -- we'll delve deeper into the newly released  files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p><p> Plus rolling back prices and rolling out robots -- how Wal-Mart is using  futuristic new technology to keep shelves stocked at dozens of stores  across the country.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news President Trump just tweeting, \"Congratulations to  Speaker Ryan, GOP leader, Steve Scalise and to the Republican Party on  budget passage yesterday.  Now the biggest tax cuts.\"</p><p> I love how he refers to it as tax cuts now.</p><p> The truth coming out -- numerous JFK assassination files have been  released.</p><p> Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest details -- Kevin.</p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there -- Dagen.  Good morning to  you.  A Red Bull morning here in the nation's capital when you think about  it the 2,800 documents released last night.  These are previously redacted  and classified documents.  And I apologize for all the noise as the leaf  blower goes by here a few times every morning right around the time I talk  to you.</p><p> But let me tell you what happened last night and this is actually a pretty  important story.  It's about the documents related to the assassination of  President Kennedy.</p><p> I think the real headline though would be the fact that many of the records  were withheld due to national security concerns, according to a memo from  the President.</p><p> Now, do keep this in mind.  Those documents contain raw intelligence.   That's uncorroborated and that's likely going to speculate -- or rather  fuel more speculation about the plot to kill the President.  We do learn a  lot about the frustration of FBI chief Herbert Hoover at Cuba's possible  role as well.</p><p> Let me share just a bit of a White House statement.  They talk about those  records that were not released overnight -- 2,800 documents.  Some people  would say it's just a drop in the bucket.  The remaining records will be  released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming  weeks.</p><p> The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from agencies,  directed them to minimize redactions without delay.  And this is an  important one from the CIA -- every single one of the approximately 18,000  remaining CIA records in the collection will ultimately be released with no  document withheld in full.  That is great.  That's a boon if you're a  researcher in particular. </p><p> Now that promise could shed more light about Lee Harvey Oswald, his trips  to Mexico before the assassination and, of course, the Castro regime  including U.S. efforts, by the way, to topple the communist dictator.</p><p> There are a number of days that we are keeping an eye on, Dagen, as we look  forward to the rolling release of these documents.  I want to point your  attention to April 26, 2018.  That's when we expect another big batch.  In  the meantime -- researchers rock on and see what you can find out.</p><p> Back to you with my friend in that bloody leaf blower -- got to love this  guy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Leaf blowers are as frightening as chainsaws and louder.  Kevin  -- you did a great job.  It's great to see you.</p><p> Kevin Corke at the White House.</p><p> Still ahead -- courting Aramco -- the president of the New York Stock  Exchange sitting down with Maria at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia to talk about what they're doing to land potentially the  biggest initial public offering of all-time.</p><p> Then Instagram getting up close and personal -- the dramatic new feature  coming to the social media app.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia our own Maria  Bartiromo was able to sit down with New York Stock Exchange president Tom  Farley and get his take on everything from the Trump effect on the market  to the magnitude of the expected Saudi Aramco IPO.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  And joining me right now is the president of  the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE president Tom Farley.  Tom -- it's good  to see you.</p><p> TOM FARLEY, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's great to be back with  you -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> FARLEY:  -- in this beautiful hall.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The hall in Saudi Arabia.  It's really incredible to me how  many people in investment management, business people are here in Saudi  this week.</p><p> FARLEY:  Yes.  I mean I was just waiting to sit down with you and impromptu  was able to have a conversation with Secretary Mnuchin, Steve Schwarzman,  Howard Marks.  And it is the great and the good of financing and finance  all around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, one of the big reasons obviously is this Saudi  Aramco deal.  They are going to take their state oil company public --  could be the biggest IPO ever.  It could be up to $75 billion.</p><p> You have Alibaba which is what -- a $24 billion deal.  This would be a huge  piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> FARLEY:  So, you know, people see me in the halls here as the head of the  New York Stock Exchange.  Everyone assumes that my relationship is totally  about the Aramco IPO.  I've actually known the -- from the minister level  to the company Saudi Aramco -- I've known the company for many years long  before the IPO was even a notion because as you know the New York Stock  Exchange is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the largest energy exchange  in the world.  I'm one of the managers of that business and Saudi Aramco is  a partner and a customer in that respect.</p><p> Regarding the IPO, we will compete for any IPO of a great global business.   I can't say too much about Saudi Aramco in particular other than anyone you  meet from the company or the ministry -- and I know you've met several of  them just this week.  They are professional.  They are sophisticated.  And  no surprise, they are carrying out a very disciplined, due diligence  process to make the right decision for Saudi Arabia as a whole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think you're going to get the deal.</p><p> FARLEY:  I'm not going to comment in particular because I don't want to  prejudice any decision that they make.  But for any great global IPO, look,  first of all we want them to make the right decision for them.  We won't  try to corner them in to make something we think is a wrong decision.</p><p> Clearly the New York Stock Exchange is the leading exchange in the world  for listings.  We have something like $34 trillion of market caps.  The  next closest exchange is a tiny, tiny fraction of that.</p><p> And so in terms of the deepest liquidity in the world that's in the United  States.  Brand name -- you get that from the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  also a rigorous governance test to be listed in the New York Stock  Exchange.  So if you list there, you're holding yourself out to be a very  well-run, well-governed company.</p><p> That is kind of the decision criteria that benefits what the New York Stock  Exchange brings.  But I have no doubt other exchanges around the world have  their own unique benefits as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are the implications of such a huge deal?  I mean if  you're looking at Alibaba being the biggest deal at $24 billion and this  deal is as high as $75 billion, give us a sense.  Give our viewers a sense  of why this is so important and what the global implications are for a  company this size to go public or to sell 5 percent of it to the public?</p><p> FARLEY:  So large IPOs are nerve-racking.  We do them a lot.  Of the top 20  IPOs of all time, I think the number is 13 have been on the New York Stock  Exchange.  And even those companies that fall on the other seven many of  them have ultimately listed in the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> We know a lot about big deals and the New York Stock Exchange is purpose- built for those big deals.  We combine humans and technology but we still  spend a lot of time getting ready for those IPOs because there is a lot of  bids and offers that come in that.  There's a lot of complexity on that  moment the stock opens.  And you need to make sure that stock opens  smoothly so that the management team of the IPO doesn't spend the next six  months or two years explaining what went wrong on IPO day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you what you're seeing right now at the New York  Stock Exchange in terms of listings.  Obviously there has always been a  massive competition between NYSE and Nasdaq.  What can you tell us in terms  of business year-to-date?</p><p> FARLEY:  Well, apropos of our interview location halfway around the world  from our normal home base, our shared home base it's a very global story.   The IPO market is booming in the U.S. and at the New York Stock Exchange.   We've had twice as many roundabouts, twice as many IPOs as all of last  year.  We've had this year twice as much in terms of dollar value and from  all around the world.</p><p> Last week alone we had a great company from Southeast Asia and we had  another company from China.  This week we have an Argentinian company, next  week a Brazilian company.  And so we are seeing great global companies  choosing the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing more global companies relative to the U.S.?   Because the truth is there are a lot of start-ups who are saying, you know  what, I don't want to go public.  The regulatory environment is too tight.   And I'm not going to.</p><p> So that's why there was a problem.  People were wondering why the IPO  market was not so busy earlier this year.  The start-ups were not going  public.  </p><p> FARLEY:  I'm glad you asked that.  You know, the American audience likes to  make a big deal out of a story.  There are not as many American tech  companies going public.  And that's true.  Some of the great American tech  companies have chosen to stay private.</p><p> The last week alone, we had a young man who started a company three years  ago to provide a technology that allows for consumer lending in China --  that company is now worth over $10 billion.  It's an amazing tech story.   And the Friday company, too was a technology company that offers gaming, e- commerce and payments from Singapore.  We just don't talk about it as much  frankly because it's not American.</p><p> But these are great tech companies choosing to go public, choosing the New  York Stock Exchange fortunately.  I'm appreciative that they did choose the  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, here is a stat for you -- listed public companies in the  U.S. down 50 percent over 20 years because of the regulatory environment.   I mean the President has said he is calling for IPOs, the bar for IPOs to  be lowered.  </p><p> The Treasury came out with a report. They're basically saying the  regulatory environment is way too hard for companies to go public.</p><p> What are you doing in terms of lowering the bar, in terms of lowering the  standards, making it easier for companies to go public?</p><p> FARLEY:  You know, I think you are referring to our press report that came  out.  And if you work your way down that press report the next paragraph  starts with some of the efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and I  personally have engaged in, to push the administration to make it easier to  engage in IPOs.</p><p> You mentioned the number of public companies.  It is down by about half.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  But the average market cap is up by over three times -- The  aggregate market cap.  So the average company is five or six times bigger.   The public market works great for big companies.  It's not working as well  for small companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p> FARLEY:  And we need to acknowledge that because small companies are the  life blood of free enterprise.  They give the inspiration to even smaller  companies.  They create jobs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what can you do?  What can you do to get more small  companies to go public then?</p><p> FARLEY:  Simple things.  The pendulum has swung too far on regulation with  Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Big companies can handle it.  Small  companies can't.  So if you can allow the small companies during the IPO  process to meet more with investors and analysts, you can reduce the  Sarbanes-Oxley requirements on small companies.</p><p> Like for example, not require an external audit for the first few years  that a company is public.  And you could extend that to all new companies  not just the tiniest ones but expand the envelope a little bit and have it  be for all new companies that are new to public market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean one thing is create a longer window of time in  which companies can be in the emerging growth category.</p><p> FARLEY:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  Exactly.  And what that emerging market growth category does is it  just requires less regulation for small companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  You know, regulation is like taxes.  No regulation isn't the  answer and complete government control isn't the answer -- somewhere in  between is the right answer, and the pendulum is going to swing.  We have  swung too far towards heavily regulating small companies and we need to  swing it back aggressively to make sure that that IPO engine is there for  those young entrepreneurs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What does the sentiment feel like to you when you go down on  the floor, when you speak to big investors?  Because how do you like the  way the President is constantly tweeting that market has gained $5.3  trillion in market value since Election Day?  We are at record highs --  23000 and counting.</p><p> Do you feel like things are getting overheated?  Do you feel the same  sentiment when you talk to investors that you did a year ago?</p><p> FARLEY:  I walk in on the floor and I look up at the indices every morning  and it's amazing what has happened since November.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Don't you think?</p><p> FARLEY:  We're 17400 that night, if you remember because the indices really  cratered and now they had zipped back up.  However I will note, it's also a  global story.  This isn't just America.  In the last two weeks alone the  DAX, the CAC, the (INAUDIBLE) -- they have all hit all-time highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> FARLEY:  So there is a really -- this is a really good moment globally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So do you feel like sentiment is still there?  The bullishness  or are people getting worried that things are getting over priced?</p><p> FARLEY:  People are bullish.  That doesn't mean there won't be a pullback  but people are bullish without question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Tom -- it's great to see  you.</p><p> FARLEY:  Great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> FARLEY:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tom Farley is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up rebuilding Puerto Rico -- 80 percent of the island is  still without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

A new Instagram camera feature that sure to take  over your story feed in the coming days.  Say it ain't so.  It involves  zooming and getting in really close.</p><p> And rolling back prices and rolling out some robots.  The futuristic new  tech coming to Walmart to ensure that shelves are always stocked.</p><p> To our stop story this half hour.  The crisis in Puerto Rico.  Two house  committees and a federal watchdog are now investigating the $300 million  no-bid contract that was awarded to Whitefish Energy holdings to repair  Puerto Rico's flattened electrical grid.</p><p> Critics say Whitefish has little experience repairing electricity  infrastructure.  And alleged the company has ties to interior secretary,  Ryan Zinke.</p><p> Joining us now is the spokesman of Whitefish Energy Holdings, Ken Luce.   Ken, what do you say to these investigations?  Are they warranted?</p><p> KEN LUCE, SPOKESMAN, WHITEFISH ENERGY HOLDINGS:  No.  The investigations  are not warranted.  First off, PREPA hired a firm Whitefish Energy who has  extensive experience fixing transmission lines, especially in the  mountains, which is our assignment.  Our assignment is 100 miles of  transmission lines mostly in the mountains of Puerto Rico, which are  necessary to restore the power ultimately overtime.</p><p> The real issue congress should be asking is where are the other firms that  the core and CORE and FEMA are hiring to come to the island to help repair  the grid?  Those contracts were just let last week.  Meaning, it's another  two or three weeks before more help us to the island.  That's the  frustration in Puerto Rico is the resources are not there yet.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And part of the controversy is that  Whitefish only had two full-time employees as reported when Maria hit  Puerto Rico on September 20th and then since hired all these employees.</p><p> You have a pretty robust experience in PR.  When did the company hire you?</p><p> LUCE:  The company hired us two ago.  But again, the point here is the  entire industry ramps up when you get contracts.  Whitefish has experience  in the mountains which is why we were hired.</p><p> If you have a question about that, and the business practice of ramping up  much like homebuilders, consulting firms and others do, look at the results  to date.  320 people are already on the island, lineman and engineers,  repairing the grid.  So if there's a question, then look at the facts.</p><p> My real issue is no one has asked the questions and then reported the  facts.  There's just this jump to say nothing's being done which is  inaccurate.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  What are the facts that you think aren't being reported?</p><p> LUCE:  Well, I mean, the fact you have two employees and you have a  business model that ramps up just like hundreds of firms in the United  States and all over the world.  And you now have 320 employees.</p><p> So if you question a two-person firm with the ability, look at their  experience which is working in mountainous regions and the CEO is leading  that effort in Puerto Rico today and we have 320 people on the ground in  less than three weeks.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Ken.  Erin Elmore here.   There were also allegations -- </p><p> LUCE:  Hi.</p><p> ELMORE:  Hi.  How are you?  There were also allegations that interior  secretary, Ryan Zinke's son had an internship at Whitefish.  What do you  say about that?  And is there any correlations there that are troubling?</p><p> LUCE:  No.  He did.  He was a flagger.  So he directed traffic on a summer  job through a friend.  But to say the interior secretary had anything to do  with the contract, number one, it's not true.  Everyone has said so.  He  found out about the contract after it was let.  And he also has no  authority over FEMA, the CORE, PREPA, so again there's a jump today to  guilt versus facts.</p><p> And then the other part of that is, if you really look at the political  landscape in Puerto Rico, an interior secretary and the current  administration would not necessarily be popular in Puerto Rico where the  majority of the population supported the other party.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Jen, these investigations aren't going away or at least  inquiries, two health committees, a federal watchdog investigating the  contract, the $300 million, no bid contract.  The governor of Puerto Rico  Rossello, says his administration will soon audit the contract awarded to  Whitefish.  And there's a retired air force colonel appointed to oversee  the reconstruction of the electoral grid following concerns over this very  contract.</p><p> So a lot of eyes on Whitefish now.</p><p> LUCE:  And again, we, welcome them.  Every member of congress should have  the information that they're asking for.  And we will certainly give that  out, but the first thing is, there were no questions asked.  Everybody  jumped to a conclusion based on the \"Washington Post\" article and no one  called.  We reached out to offices before this happened and said, if you  want information, we're more than happy to give it to you.</p><p> The contract with PREPA was done correctly.  PREPA has a company working on  the island and the current administration does not had those resources  there yet.  We welcome it and at the end, I'm just hoping people report  that there was nothing there.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, the director of Puerto Rico's power company has been  quoted saying that part of the reason that Whitefish was selected as the  only company that didn't require a down payment.</p><p> So I wanted to ask.  This does require a lot of money.  So, how well and  how was -- hos is Whitefish finance for this?</p><p> LUCE:  Well, Whitefish is very well capitalized.  They had financing from  several private equity firms.  They have met all their obligations to date.</p><p> But let me go back.  There was a very small deposit.  It was $2 million, I  believe.  There were another firm that also wanted to work, but required 10  to 15 times that amount to begin to work.</p><p> So capitalization isn't an issue.  We have 300 people working on the  island.  We have barges coming over every day.  We're trying to get our  equipment through the ports so that more men and women can come to work and  help Puerto Rico.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ken, thank you so much for being here.  Ken Luce, representing  Whitefish.</p><p> LUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  We'll see you soon.</p><p>Walmart bots roll out. M the retail giant's high-tech solution to make sure  its shelves are always stocked.</p><p> And Instagram ready for your close-up.  The new feature bringing drama to  your storyline.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More Trump tweets, breaking news right now.  Here is from the  president.  \"JFK files are being carefully released and there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to public.\"</p><p> It's not going to stop the conspiracy theory.  It was only -- all these  documents are only going to make people lose their minds.</p><p> Meantime, the FBI is set to give congress documents related to the  controversial Russian dossier that we now know the democrats and the in the  Hillary Clinton were behind.  Cheryl Casone has that story.  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  About that right, Dagen?  House Speaker, Paul Ryan says the  FBI has agreed to provide documents long stopped by congress in a variety  of investigations including information about a 35-page research document  containing unverified allegations about President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAUL RYAN, U.S. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The FBI got in  touch with us yesterday afternoon and they has -- they have informed us  that they will comply with our document requests and that they will provide  the documents congress has been asking for by next week and we expect the  FBI to honor that commitment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that both Clinton campaign chairman  John Podesta and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denied to  congressional investigators that they had any knowledge about who paid for  the dossier.  That testimony could put them in hot water, as it came a week  before it was revealed that in fact democrats had paid for part of it.</p><p> Podesta and Schultz could face perjury charges if it turns out they gave  false statements to congress.</p><p> OK.  Switching gears.  A 10-year-old, 10-year-old.  Leading police on a  dangerous high-speed chase that hit 100 miles an hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Leaving off-road, driving down the (inaudible) get back  on the highway.  Heat up, 31, 31.  Heat up.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Roll out the window.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Break the window.  Break the window.</p><p> CASONE (voice-over):  Yes, all this went down yesterday morning in Ohio.   Cleveland Police say they saw the boy's car speed by, chased by another car  possibly driven his mother.</p><p> The 15-mile chase lasted less than an hour.  It finally ended after a  trooper was able to nudge the car into that sign, as you can see here with  his cruiser.  The kid was boxed in.  The kid was taken into custody.   Police say this same little boy stole his mother's Dodge Charger for a spin  and went down Interstate 90 earlier this month.  Yes, all right.</p><p>Instagram, introducing a new feature called Super Zoom.  Users can create  dramatic zoom and shots and you can set it to music.  This is the second  big update from Instagram this week.</p><p> Just days ago, they launched a live together feature.  Users can stream  live with friends.  Instagram saying last month they had 800 million  monthly active users across the world.</p><p> And Walmart planning to deploy robots now to 50 stores by the end of  January.  These robots are going to scan isles for out of stock items,  products that are in the wrong place, incorrect pricing, even wrong labels.   Walmart has been testing these robots in a span number of stores in  Arkansas and California.</p><p> Taking a look at the stock.  Shares of Walmart, Dagen, up about 28 percent  so far this year.  And those are your speedy headlines.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's insane.  And I think we should point out it's just  a miracle that nobody was hurt whether, it's the kid or a passenger in  another car, a driver in another car.  I want to point that out.</p><p> But in terms of this Instagram feature, Erin just changed my life when she  told me about this.  An app.  It's called YouCam Perfect.  It basically  edits your face.  And it's literally if you take a selfie, it takes about  20 years off my age.</p><p> Elmore:  I told you were never going to be the same again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I need to buy you -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Because now people can be using it when they're on their dating  websites.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You couldn't tell like way better than they actually do.</p><p> ELMORE:  It's just you only refreshed with a good night sleep.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Exactly.  I'm sure the person who meets up with you feel that  way too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  At the cancer center with my mother where I never wear any  makeup.  People see me now they're going to go, you look familiar but you  look like the older sister of somebody on television.  I'm like, OK,  thanks.</p><p> If only there's a filter we could walk around with an everyday life.  You  hand it to people.</p><p> Still ahead, let there be light.  Actor and director, Kevin Sorbo joining  us with his wife Sam Sorbo, to talk about their new movie shining a light  on the crisis of faith.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hollywood sexual harassment secrets revealed.  Our next guests,  \"Hercules\" actor, Kevin Sorbo, says he too was a victim.  Joining us now is  Kevin and his actress wife, Sam.  They're here to talk about their new  movie.</p><p> But, first, I wanted to talk about -- because you have come out and said  that you -- that Gianni Versace hit on him.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO, AMERICAN ACTOR:  In my book and it happened years ago.  It's  already in my book.  It's not like a secret.  I didn't suffer any trauma  from it but I'm not taking with the people who have, because it's out  there.  Look at them.  I'm a big dude.  Most people in Hollywood aren't  going to -- they're not going to kid on me.  They're afraid of me.</p><p> The most male actors are five-eight.  I'm a big guy.</p><p> SAM SORBO, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  What's amazing is to see now this sorted --  the sorted underbelly of Hollywood coming out.  And we have a film that's  coming out tonight and it's almost the antisepsis of that, right?  Produced  outside of Hollywood with Sean Hannity, as you know.  Not funded by  Hollywood at all.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fox News Channel, so he -- we have to disclose that.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  He's on the Fox News Channel.  No, it's true and so we're kind  of excited that -- because this film takes a different one.  This is the --  this is the film that Hollywood used to produce.  The uplifting film.  The  film with Godly character.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Prior to the '60s, Hollywood produced, character-driven  movies.  And now, it's changed.  They celebrate antihero.  They celebrate  sort of the negativity in life.  It's just weird to me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't think it's a stretch to say this that with Hollywood and  people in that industry broadly speaking that there's a disconnect between  individual and family and faith.</p><p> And that that -- it is largely an industry that is if they don't -- faith  is not front and center if people go to church regularly.  And so, do you  think that that opened the door for greater sexual harassment over decades?   And I'm not naming any individual.  But it's a lack connection to God and  higher power.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  It's actually -- it's a different face.  OK.  If you think of  it as a non-faith -- </p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Every movie is faith-based movie.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  Their face is different.  They put faith in Darwinism and  evolution and survival of the fittest, which is what Harvey Weinstein did.   Survival of the fittest.  He took what he wanted and he got it.  And  sometimes they made him pay for it and he was cool with that.  And it was  business as usual and everybody who knew about it was perfectly fine with  it.  It's a completely different face.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You worship at the altar of filth.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Yes.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  And so in our movie, we juxtapose the two, right?  We have two  people who are grieving and one of them worships at the altar of self.   He's basically an egomaniac.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  That's my character.  Yes, he's not a very good guy.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  And his ex-wife.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  But he's a lost man.  He's lost.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  He's lost.  And an ex-wife who is faithful and goes to church  and is raising their two boys in the Christian faith.  And so we juxtapose  the two.  And you can walk it alone or you can walk it with higher power  and you see the difference.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to watch this clip:  \"Let There Be Light.\"  Opens  nationwide today.  Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAM SORBO:  What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of  their brother and using his part of your carnival act?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  It pays the bills.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Daddy.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clinically dead in entrance for four minutes.  It's a  miracle.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's incredible.  And you wrote it, Sam.  You co-wrote the  script.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  I co-wrote it with Dan Gordon who's a very well-known Hollywood  screenwriter and I was -- I was lucky that he jumped right on board when he  heard the idea.  And then two weeks later, out of the blue Sean calls Kevin  and says.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Sean gave me a call and says, hey, I want to do movie with  you.  I love your got -- what soul-searching movie.  And I said, we got  one.  And we included in the arc and boom.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm going to put you on the spot.  Is this your favorite project  you've ever worked on?  Especially you work with your wife and she co-wrote  it?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Well, there's questions, one of my favorite ones.  It's in  the top five.  I've done between Hercules and a drama and then -- and then  54 movies.  I've done a lot of work.</p><p> I mean, but I'm very fortunate that I'm still working, because certainly  coming out of the conservative Christian closet in Hollywood for an  industry this of tolerance and freedom of speech, it's pretty much a one- way street with them.  So I've been very lucky to keep working.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  People can go to lettherebelightmovie.com.  They can find out  what theaters it's playing.  And if it's not playing in the theater near  you, I urge people to go, call the theaters or go to the website and  organize group tickets.</p><p> We found that there's a little bit of a threshold, higher thresholds for  faith-based films being booked into theaters.  If they're looking for some  sort of proof, some sort of presales and stuff, that they don't typically  look for in non-faith movies -- </p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Well, that's kind of typical for small independent movies.   It really is that way, if you don't have a big budget to promote.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  The idea with movies is, movies are storytelling.  They shape  the culture.  Hollywood shapes our culture.  Do we want the culture of  Hollywood to trickle down into this culture?  Do we want the culture of  Harvey Weinstein to be pervasive in the U.S. culture?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Kevin.  Are you finding though that people are more  receptive to conservative, more receptive to people who are kind of wear  their faith on the outside as a lot of people and other parts of the  Hollywood?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Let me tell you something.  I travel a lot.  One to airports.   Wherever I'm on streets, cities, no matter where I am, people walk up to me  now, not because of \"Hercules\" and drama, they walk to me because of  (INAUDIBLE) please make more movies like this.</p><p> So if they want to see more movies like this, they have to support them,  because like I said, we don't have the big budget to bring these out there.   And movies like this become successful because of word-of-mouth.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sam and Kevin Sorbo and you can see -- I'm on \"Outnumbered\"  today.  I'm lucky, guys.  So I'll be very nice.  I promise.  Thank you both  so much.</p><p> Still ahead, exed out.  Apple's iPhone 10 selling out already.  Presales  started earlier today.  When can you get it and how much will you pay?

But busy earning season continues with two big oil  companies reporting.  We just had Exxon earnings hitting the tape, earnings  per share of 93 cents topping expectations.  Revenue also a beat.  Kevin  Kelly, your thoughts on the energy sector because again, this is huge surge  in earnings off the bottom a year -- near the bottom a year ago.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And that highlights the effect of what's really driving the  earning season this year because the energy sector was so depressed when  you think about where oil was even a year ago.  You had 25, 30, $35.00,  $45.00 a barrel of oil.  Now we stayed now consistently above 50 but that  hasn't played through yet.  So one of the interesting aspects is we're  going to want to see what guidance is going forward.  Investors are solely  focused on the effects of the hurricanes that are going to be in Chevron as  well as the Exxon.  What they see going forward where they are in terms of  cost cuts, that's been a very, very big focus for them because a lot of  times, the cost of oil a barrel is higher for a lot of these integrated  when you're thinking Exxon, Chevron, right?  So they're in -- they're all  over the globe, and so because there has been a depression of prices  globally that's affecting them, the last thing is also what they're going  to do M&amp;A wise.  People are worried that they need to start buying  companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory backdrop because we always focus on  Washington and what the Congress hasn't done on health care and taxes but  in terms of the regulation rollback that is something the Trump  administration has been on top of and that does particularly help energy  companies.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  That really helps energy companies and they've even spoken  about that on their investor and conference call all year long.  They're  waiting for actually even more deregulation to happen in the space  especially for them to deploy more of their capital because we've seen coal  as actually done really well this year and the supplies are up and people  are using it more especially with renewable energies and a lot of tax  credits that are flowing through on there.  So a lot -- a lot of policy  coming out of Washington is going to dictate what happens to these  companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google on track  for record highs today.  Amazon stock also getting a boost; Microsoft and  Intel really pushing up the Dow futures this morning.  You look at these  stocks go and Amazon on the news that not just earnings but Amazon is  getting into the pharmacy business or it's gotten approval for wholesale  pharmacy licenses and at least dozens stays.  This comes as the Wall Street  Journal, Kevin, is reporting that giant drugstore chain CVS is in talks to  buy the third largest insurer in the country.  Aetna for $66 billion.  This  CVS deal is in direct response to Amazon, is that right?  What other kinds  of deals could we be looking at in response to Amazon's move into more and  more businesses?  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And this really is a shot across the bow because if you think  about what did Amazon do that was of the most significant recently, they  bought Whole Foods, right?  So with getting the state licenses, with  pharmacies can they start distributing -- basically prescription drugs  through their whole partnership and logistics with Whole Foods.  So you see  CVS actually now striking out and looking to do a deal with Aetna and  insurer which they have no experience in.  So this is actually pretty  telling.  We're going to see this story play out over the next couple  quarters, not years.  There is going to be a lot of activity and we're  going to get a lot of activity and we're going to get a lot of direction  that's coming through on that.  And you can see, Amazon is fighting, Wal- Mart toe-to-toe and especially when in the next leg of fight with them is  in the -- is in the prescription drug business.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is a huge business.</p><p> ELMORE:  Prices can come way down.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are some drug packages like with Medicare prescription  drug packages packages, the part D that you can only buy prescriptions at  like major pharmacy like you aren't able and allowed to go and buy -- get  prescriptions at smaller like local pharmacy.  You literally have to.   Where I'm from you have to go to Wal-Mart.  It's the only place you can go.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  And the Whole -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, again trying to break up that juggernaut.</p><p> KELLY:  And Amazon's idea behind this is the description model.  So people  don't need to continuously go to the pharmacy if they have a physical  presence and then they can get that subscription.  They'll figure out the  delivery and like I said, with their logistic systems that they do have  with Whole Foods.</p><p> ELMORE:  And the delivery is a great idea for people that are homebound or  wheelchair bound, things like that, it's also helping that market, they  really can't help themselves, so I think that's really nice for us people.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But with this CVS acquisition of Aetna in terms of what it could  potentially do expanding, basically giving a huge number of new customers  through Aetna for its pharmacy benefit management business bolstering its  leverage in negotiation for drug with drug makers in terms of pricing power  and then also you strike deals with -- to tie drug prices to patient  outcomes which is also incredible.  I want to move on to Washington, this  time, it's about truth coming out of D.C.  Numerous JFL assassination filed  released.  Blake Burman is at the White House with the very latest.  Blake,  good morning.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  And this was nearly 2900 additional documents relating to  President Kennedy and his assassination that were produce last night by the  National Archives, not all the documents though within this last batch  though were put forward as the president said in a memo that \"Certain  information should continue to be redacted because of national security,  law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.\"  These newest documents  though do shed more details about the events surrounding the assassination  of JFK.  For example, one shows that a British reporter received a phone  call about 25 minutes before President Kennedy was shot and was told that  there would be impending \"Big news.\"  </p><p> Another detail show an FBI source then claimed days later that the Soviet  Union was fearful that a missile could head their way because of the  actions of an irresponsible U.S. general.  This final batch of the last set  of documents has to be released now by the end of April.  And President  Trump tweeted out moments ago the following, he said and I quote, \"JFK  files are being carefully released.  In the end, there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to the public.\"   For now, Dagen if you need good some good reading, you're just curious or  whatever it might be, all you have to do is head on over to National  Archives Web site, the documents are listed right there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm tempted, I am really tempted when I came out I was  (INAUDIBLE)I got other stuff I need to read.  So yes, weekend reading.   Thank you so much --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BURMAN:  It will be there for a while.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  Great to see you as always.   Preorders for the iPhone selling out in just minutes, overnight.  What it  means for anyone trying to get their hands on this hot device.  The release  date is technically November the 3rd but what if you need it before  Christmas or the holidays?  And nobody can drive down the field like Tom  Brady but at least you can drive down the road like the Patriots superstar.   The hot new ride from Aston-martin inspired by the greatest of all time.</p><p> KELLY:  Not.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Preorders for the Apple 10 iPhone starting today but you might  have trouble getting yours in.  Cheryl Casone has more details on this.   Hey, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Hey, Dagen.  Sources saying supplies of the hot  new phone are sold out, shipping estimates slipping well beyond the  November 3rd launch date here in the U.S. on Apple's Web site five to six  weeks right now.  According to one report by the way out in Hong Kong,  they're sold out online with both models of the iPhone 10 currently  unavailable.  That's in that country.  The phone apparently also sold out  on Apple's Web site over in the U.K.  Now this news coming on weak sales of  the iPhone 8 by the way, two research firms saying the 8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  Shares of Apple trading  higher in the premarket higher by more than one percent.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco, Kiko  Alonso nails it, knocks off Flacco's helmet.  And then huge fight ensues  after the hit.  Alonso was given the unnecessary roughest penalty, Alonso  crushing Flacco as he goes for the (INAUDIBLE) Flacco would go straight  into the locker room with a concussion and he would not return to the game.</p><p> Well, let's stay with some football here.  Tom Brady has got a pretty cool  new ride, Aston-Martin selling a special Tom Brady signature edition car.   The luxury convertible for $360,000.  The British sports car usually  associated with 007, it's now going T.V. 12.  Brady's signature is on the  door, on the plates, on the doors, on the T.V. 12 logo.  It's all over the  vehicle basically.  It's on the fender, it's on the headrest.  But if you  want one, keep in mind there's only 12 of these being made.</p><p> And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has launched the zombie  Frappuccino, the drink apparently inspired by an apple dips and caramel,  taste like a tart green apple we are told.  We're going to find out just a  second in our taste tester on set.  Starbucks hoping the drink is going to  -- well, catch on like the uniform Frappuccino which was a huge hit back in  April for the company.  Starbucks, the stock anyway is down about one  percent in the premarket right now.  Stock to watch.  So let's go with  these. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What's the verdict?  OK.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I do think it taste like a tart green apple with caramel.  It  really --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, yes.  It's a lot of ones.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ELMORE:  -- together and put in a blender and eat it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cheryl, technically if it's a zombie Frappuccino, wouldn't it  taste like rotting flesh?</p><p> CASONE:  No.  Well, you know, you would think so, Dagen, but I don't think  that's what they're going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p> KELLY:  You also like to know what rotting flesh tastes like, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p> CASONE:  The pink whipped cream is supposed to be the brains, OK?  The red  mocha drizzle is blood obviously.  It might gross you out. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CASONE:  No, but, you know, by the way, you have to like kind of drink them  quick, because once they kind of -- the mixed up basically they're saying  like you -- once you order these, like don't like hold on to it because it  -- and then it gets kind of funky color.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Slurpy same thing happens. </p><p> ELMORE:  Yes.  Slurpy, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, paving the way for a public debut.  Maria, sitting  down with a top name from SoftBank to top about the timeline for a possible  Uber IPO. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you, ESPN reporting that Alibaba co- founder Joseph Tsai has reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49  percent minority stake The Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets worth $1.8 billion by  the latest valuation according to Forbes Magazine.  So, the Nets --</p><p> KELLY:  That's the Chinese and the Russians together now owning the Nets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I still not go to games.  Where can you find value in this  market?  Maria Bartiromo sat down with SoftBank investment adviser Rajeev  Misra in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where she asked him just that.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  You are $100-billion vision fund is dominating  conversations across the world, congratulations -- </p><p> RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISE, SOFTBANK:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- on the performance as well.  Tell us how you're allocating  capital.  Where are the growth opportunities in the world today? </p><p> MISRA:  Group opportunities are everywhere but it's concentrated with  entrepreneurial equal system exist and that's primarily in two locations,  China and U.S. If you look at our fund and we have two pools of capital in  SoftBank.  The vision fund which a hundred billion, plus SoftBank group  itself which makes a lot of technology and investment off this balance  sheet.  We own -- we bought the ARM last year, we have Sprint, and SoftBank  Mobile, we have 28 percent stake in Alibaba that also has grown in value  and so there are two pools of capital.  But almost half our investments are  going into U.S. 50 odd billion, a lot chunk will be in China where there's  a large population-based and there they are leapfrogging technology to  include a large part of the population hence from ride-sharing companies  like Didi to bicycle-sharing that go for food delivery, et cetera, et  cetera is very exciting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you.</p><p> MISRA:  No, Uber is not looking to take 10 billion from us, they will get a  billion -- a billion and one half as primary investment.  There is  potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity to shareholders and  employees who are early investors to sell secondary shares to SoftBank and  we are late-stage discussions to potentially buy some secondary shares from  early investors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the valuations, is it harder today to find  value which is also a growth story?  I mean, obviously, Alibaba has been an  incredible performer for you, but when you look elsewhere, is there another  Alibaba out there?  </p><p> MISRA:  There may not be Alibaba but we make a thousand times in return but  we vested Nvidia nine months ago, we bought five percent of Nvidia for --  close to $3 billion, it's worth six billion in nine months.  So you don't  have to find just Alibaba to make good investments.  We are going through a  technology revolution as we speak in every aspect of human life, from food  delivery to life sciences to as I said insurance, to selling used cars, to  selling homes, to buy -- getting a mortgage, to so far getting us to loan,  every aspect of life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everything is the sharing economy.  </p><p> MISRA:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right? </p><p> MISRA:  So there is plenty of opportunities.  Valuation is not an issue if  you find the right companies that are market leaders, that have the right  entrepreneur and management, to scale, to go global, this is what SoftBank  helps with and we are a consumer company too.  We have 35 million  subscribers with Sprint, with 35 million subscribers in SoftBank Mobile in  Japan, et cetera.  And getting these companies to work with each other,  learning from each other, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  A ride- sharing companies in India Ola learns a lot from Didi in China from their  experiences and vice versa.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Telecom has been really critical for you.  Why is Telecom sort  of the underlying important, you know, backdrop of some of your  investments? </p><p> MISRA:  There are four factors that are shaping the technology revolution.   First, processing power, the ability to process and the cost of processing  has gone through phenomenal scale where your iPhone today can process  cheaper and faster than mainframe 15 years ago or a laptop computer 10  years ago, data, second.  Ability to collect data and able to process the  data which is driving (INAUDIBLE) in media which is called the graphic  processing unit and ability to structure large and analyze large  unstructured data pools and make sense out of it and predict outcomes and  predict consumer behavior, managing inventory and be able to analyze that  kind of data.  So data -- ability of collecting data and having access to  data is a second factor.  Processing data software to analyze it and  lastly, Telecom speed and cost of Telecom.  Look at 10 years ago, there  were no smartphones.  Smartphones came in 2007.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now can't live without them.  </p><p> MISRA:  And we can't live without them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> MISRA:  And the ability to have that kind of processing power in your car,  in your smartphone, in your house, so on.  Telecom speed is important for  that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) Let me ask you about A.I. and the worry there.   People are wondering what skill set do I need to drive in this new world.   A.I. means robotics machine learning.  Are we going to have more robots  than humans?  Are they going to take human's jobs?.  </p><p> MISRA:  We already have a lot of robots, car is a robot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  True.</p><p> MISRA:  You know, a robot doesn't have to walk and speak, I mean, they're  kind of bots and robots.  A phone --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, should we be afraid of it?  </p><p> MISRA:  Not at all.  You have more -- you have robots today versus 10 years  ago.  You have all these cars that robots, your iPhone is a robot, et  cetera, et cetera.  They only would make -- enable your life a lot better.   They will provide healthcare services better, they will make your  entertainment better, you can listen to music, your wristwatch, your  tracker, but what skills the young needs to know and learn is there's so  much learn by -- you don't have to be a computer programmer to be -- to be  successful in this -- in the next generation.  You need to learn -- you  need to go to China, you need to go to India, see what -- all you need to  do is take what's successful in one part of the world and take it to  another.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Rajeev, it's great to have you on the program today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> MISRA:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The first reading on third-quarter GDP on the other  side of this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  3.0 percent, that's how fast the U.S. economy was growing, this  is the first reading on the third quarter gross domestic product, it's our  biggest measure, most important measure of how the overall U.S. economy is  doing.  The expectation was for 2-1/2 percent, they're about to get three  percent and see that nice three number in the front of GDP growth.  It is  kind of exciting if you want the U.S. to do well.  Joining us now is one of  our favorites guest of all time, MacroMavens president, Stephanie Pomboy.   Stephanie, just your initial take on this three percent reading, how is it  that we're growing at a three percent growth? </p><p> STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Wow.  Well, you know, I'm  surprised, I want to see the details in terms of the inventory contribution  versus the consumer spending because obviously what we care about is seeing  strong spending rather than just some inventory bill.  And I know that at  least the Atlanta fed and they're, therefore, had built in almost a full  percentage point contribution from inventories largely due from hurricanes  that we saw.  So that will be interesting to look at but as you know, you  know, my concern has been that there's been a broad deceleration in growth,  not that the wheels are off but that in a way it been general turning  downward this highways a little bit.  Since 2015, I've seen slowing tax  receipts, actually, treasury tax receipts are now down year and year which  is a recession reading.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> POMBOY:  So there's some things that just don't square with the strength of  the headlined numbers and I'm very interested to find out, you know, what  the details here are.  The other thing we're seeing that's a little is  disturbing kind of conflicts with the strong headline spending in GDP  numbers are the rise and the delinquencies.  So, there are couple things  out there that have me concerned and this is why I'm so anxious to see the  tax cuts come through because we need to pass this baton from monetary to  fiscal policy and get some more (INAUDIBLE) into the economy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think this three percent though gives Congress more --  that they think, the economy is doing OK, there is no urgency? That's my  worry.  </p><p> POMBOY:  That's the danger, exactly.  I mean, I'm -- since I'm looking at  thing like tax receipts and delinquencies and, you know, the slowing  consumer discretionary spending, I'm worried, you know, I'm sitting here  biting nails like they've got to get this done fast.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, I'm glad you brought up tax receipts because I'm extremely  worried because the Fed keeps saying we haven't had inflation but they're  looking at the wrong indicators.  Look at asset inflation, it's been  unbelievable, look at health care, the price of health care has gone up  exponentially.  The price of getting a college education has gone up  significantly.  So when they're talking about the PCE and they're talking  about CPI, those are all just like, you know, areas for them to deflect.   Asset inflation they've even been worried about.  Now, do you see headwinds  coming about because now we're at -- I'm looking where recession highs for  the dollar, 10-year yields are going up.  I mean, do you see that this  could be the only two-quarter GDP for that we get that's good given the  headwinds?  </p><p> POMBOY:  Well, this is what I worry about, you know, I'm glad you talked  about the rising cost of health care intuition, housing expenses have gone  up a lot in the couple of years.  So if you strip out housing in health  care, you know, that's 40 percent of the increasing in consumer spending.   So discretionary spending as I said, you know, has been slowing and  actually, people are now relying more on credit cards and transfer payments  to, you know, cover their everyday necessities.  So I think it's a major  issue and then you've got the Fed doing Q.T. which isn't going to help in  terms of, you know, tightening credit conditions, et cetera.  So this is  why again, I come back to the urgency of really getting these tax cuts  through and getting some relief because right now, clearly the trend toward  decelerating growth notwithstanding this current GDP, the third quarter is,  you know, going to continue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is the best six-month stretch since mid-2014 for the  economy in terms of GDP, and the commerce department said that this was  particularly interesting or strong, because of the hurricane.  We were  still able to grow at three percent for the quarter.  And this is the first  reading, it could be revised downward or upward, but, again, it was  particularly spectacular for that reason because of the weather.  </p><p> POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I think the things to watch going forward is what's  happening obviously on the consumer spending front, like you said, you  know, I think some of the data actually, the monthly data had been  surprisingly strong over that hurricane period.  We did see yesterday,  retail inventories were much weaker though when you saw auto inventories  thankfully, you know, post their largest decline since the recession and  that's sort of a silver lining of this hurricane, and you might have  provided all these producers some relief on the inventory front because  they've been dealing with very high -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, here we go.  Consumer spending gain was driven by motor  vehicles as Americans replaced cars damaged by the storms and then services  spending by contrast flow to its weakest since 2013, so that goes into your  kind of discretionary spending outside of housing and health care.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about inventories and --  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I'm pulling that out.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Can I ask you real quick about the  Fed and the plan to unwind balance sheets the Fed, what risk do you see in  terms of future GDP from that?  </p><p> POMBOY:  Well, I think we are credit dependent economy, you know, I always  talk about how it's the car basically, and credit is the fuel that gets it  going, and we've actually reached the point where we rely -- we're getting  worse mileage basically, we need gas in the tank go each additional GDP  mile.  So if you're to start to reduce the supply of fuel in the economy,  the credit fuel which is what the Fed is basically going to do but natural  tendency of the economy is going to be to grow with a slower rate.  And  we're already, you know, in the deceleration phase and the interesting  thing on that too is bank credits, total bank lending has already rolled  over sharply ahead of Q.T.  So, we haven't gone to see the real Fed  tightening and yet credit conditions are already starting to slow down.  So  this again, you know, just underscore why I'm really focused on the tax  cuts because, you know, we got to pass the baton from monetary to fiscal  policy, and right now, you know, it's a nail-biter.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And trading inventories added a combined 1.14 to the growth.  </p><p> POMBOY:  OK.  Yes.  It was supposed to add about .8, so that's a  substantially larger ad.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> POMBOY:  So real final sales been were one-six.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> POMBOY:  So that's not, you know, that's not from 2.9 last quarter.  That's  a pretty big slowdown.  So -- anyway, totally we'll get this tax cut.</p><p> POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) in the --</p><p> KELLY:  Real economy.</p><p> POMBOY:  In the real economy.  That would be nice.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stephanie, it's so good to see you always.  Because you all --  every time we talk to you, you always tell us something that we don't know  and it's just a different --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> POMBOY:  Well, that's my job.  I think, you know, let's focus on the stuff  these people are focused on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Some people kind of tell you what you've already heard 800  times.  Not you, Stephanie Pomboy.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> POMBOY:  Thank you so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Have a great weekend.  Big oil in focus this morning as well,  Exxon and Chevron reporting earnings, both companies topping expectations.   Joining us now is price futures group senior market analyst, fox business  contributor, Mr. Phil Flynn.  Mr. Flynn, what do you see in these earnings?</p><p> PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  We're  putting the big back in big oil.  How about that?  I mean, these are  companies that a couple years ago were given up for dead, ExxonMobil used  to be the biggest energy company in the world, moved down to number four,  Chevron, of course, had some major problems with earnings, but what a  comeback right now, especially if you look at ExxonMobil, what an amazing  earnings quarter when you consider the fact that their entire refining  operation on Gulf Coast was under water last quarter.  </p><p> They're saying that their earnings would have been even better, you know,  four cents better if it weren't for that situation.  So we're seeing  something going on that's reflected not only in oil prices but in the GDP.   You know, sometimes this comeback in oils really reflective of what we've  been seeing in the economy and the economy that's recovering not only here  but around the globe, and that's why I'm really excited about big oil and  big earnings because that means the economy is feeling, demand for oil and  natural gas is going up, that means people are working so this is great  news for the economy today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Phil, great to see you as always.  Phil Flynn.</p><p> FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Coming up.  An electrifying performance from tech.   Stuart Varney weighing in on the huge gains from industry giants like  Amazon, Microsoft, Google.  And is the key to getting back on track going  off the rails?  Why General Electric is said to be considering an exit from  its railroad business.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Titans of tech, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are they more  powerful than we thought?  Joining me now with his thoughts, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Even more powerful than we thought.  Well, yes, I  guess they are. I mean, turning in a performance like that yesterday  afternoon, those profit gains and now the stock price gains, I mean, for  those of you who are listening too what's on the radio, let me read this  out.  Amazon is $81.00 a share, Microsoft is up $5.00 a share, that's about  seven percent by the way, and Alphabet up is $43.00 per share.  Did anybody  see this coming?  I didn't.  I don't know about these analysts but I  certainly didn't, that was an absolutely blowout performance.  And it  extends the power of the American technology into whole new industries.   Why CVS is looking at Aetna, a corner drugstore with a health insurer, why?   Because Amazon is just around the corner coming on strong when may be the  delivery prescription drugs.  They are everywhere, these five technology  companies, they're just astonishing and quite frankly, Dagen, I am blown  away by it, period.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, because the decision if you're an investor, it literally  -- and we have talked about this for years.  It literally comes down to do  I want to own a piece of a great American business that's getting even big  -- bigger that is dominating a variety of fields or do I want to lend Uncle  Sam the Federal government, money for 10 years, and only get paid less than  2-1/2 percent in yield because that's really the decision if you're buying  a treasury versus a stock.  </p><p> VARNEY:  That's right.  Let's weigh this up, shall we? Do I join the  marking global economy and buy into technology stock and then my money goes  through the roof or do I lend -- as you say, lend to Uncle Sam and get me  two percent?  Which do I do?  OK.  I'm dead safe with Uncle Sam, I got it  but I'm going nowhere.  I'm taking a risk with technology, but I'm going  somewhere.  As for putting new money in now, that I'm not so sure of.  I'm  going to hold off on that, but as everybody knows, I do I own some  Microsoft and my point today is I'm not selling at this point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think Satya Nadella of Microsoft makes better decisions  with your money or Congress?  We already pay taxes, that's -- I know that's  a little simplistic but I always think -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> VARNEY:  No, it's a loaded question.  That's what it is.  You know where  I'm coming from too.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're fantastic each and every day.</p><p> VARNEY:  I do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart is coming up in almost exactly 15 minutes.  A reminder,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Three whole hours of  Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p> The first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter coming  in much better than expected.  Nicole Petallides on floor at the New York  Stock Exchange.  Hey, Nicole. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good Friday morning, Dagen.  Yes, that's  right.  We're seeing the economy here in the U.S. in the latest quarter  grow faster than expected, at three percent rate faster than the 2.5  percent rate that was expected.  Why did that happen?  That was consumer  and also business spending that helped it along and that's why you did see  that growth there despite Harvey and Irma.  </p><p> Taking a look at Futures right now, up 17 points for the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  We'll see if we can make some records today.  Taking a  look at Merck, though, Dow component, Merck, that is to the downside this  morning, sales dropped three percent overall.  It did very well with  KEYTRUDA.  That is their U.S. long -- that's a cancer patient -- U.S.  cancer -- lung cancer and that really helped them along but not enough to  break through.  Stock down 2-1/2 percent, profit beat, they raised the  outlook but a sales miss overall.  </p><p> Then there's Colgate-Palmolive, so that was relatively flat.  Let's take a  look at that.  It did ramp up ad spending, about 20 percent ramped that up,  and that cut into the numbers.  That is down one-third of one percent.  And  good old G.E., well, G.E., of course, you know, we reported recently how  it's dropped out of the dividend portfolio for Morgan Stanley.  Well, now,  they're exiting and saying that they want to exit out of the railroad  business.  Just not seeing the demand, it is a seasonal business, it is --  is it inconsistent, and they have so many others from aviation to power,  health care, just to name some.</p><p> So, this morning, we're seeing it up one-quarter of one percent, but we did  see those new lows as to -- on 10.26 of 21.20.  We're not too far off of  that, so people are holding to this one for the long term, they've been  ultimately very disappointed, and there is talk (INAUDIBLE) outlook they  might be cutting the dividend, too.  And that's why Morgan Stanley,  ultimately, tried to pull them out of that portfolio for wealth management  because it's not really what they're looking for big picture.  </p><p> We have much more, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, coming up right after this, happy  Friday to you.  Keep it here on Fox Business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If Tesla wants to revolutionize how we drive, Zero Motorcycles  who wants to take your love of the road to the next level.  No noise, no  vibrations, but all the power and torque of the best bikes out there.  It's  electric and it's the next great American brand, completely made in the  United States.  Joining me now, is Zero Motorcycles' CEO, Sam Paschel.   Tell me about the bike, Sam, because I'm a Harley fan, that's a regular  old-fashioned and internal combustion engine.</p><p> SAM PASCHEL, ZERO MOTORCYCLES CEO:  It is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And this is not anything like that.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It is.  This is -- it's the most innovative motorcycle in the  world.  If you're familiar with a Harley, something like a Harley Sportster  1200.  Will have about 73 foot-pounds of torque.  That's basically how much  force is being applied to that back tire to really give you the  acceleration.  Zero Motorcycles -- the bike right in front of us has about  116 foot-pounds of torques.  So, you're getting the acceleration and  performance out of a, like a modern day superbike out of one of these  electric motorcycles.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are you going after the audience that Harley Davidson goes  after?  What's your key demographic?  </p><p> PASCHEL:  The key demographics, we have three basic types of riders that  make up the majority of who we reach out to.  First, we have riders that  tend to have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  You know, the  electric motorcycle phenomenon, electric vehicles overall are still pretty  new.  In 2011, there were about 2,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States overall, four wheels, two wheels, everything else.  Flash forward it  last year, and there were about 160,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States and about 780,000 globally.  So, this phenomenon is catching on.   But within the motorcycle community, it's still relatively new.  So, the  three types of riders we generally get are riders who have a quiver of  bikes that have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  We get new riders,  people, that don't have that established connection with any one brand.   And throw a leg over a Zero and just fall in love with it.  </p><p> And three, and actually, probably the most common, we have riders who love  motorcycle riding at one point in their life, and then for one reason or  another, had a family, had kids, moved away from it, and now it's the lure  of electric and the differentiated ride that's really drawing them back.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've been on a Harley or eight in my days, and these bikes, they  don't have the roar and the rumble of a Harley that Harley riders and  devotees really crave.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It's true.  It's true.  If you think about riding a motorcycle,  and you've been on one, it's a -- it's an experience that uses all five  senses.  Three of those senses on an electric motorcycle are going to be  completely different than they are on a gas bike.  First, as you mentioned,  is the -- is the audio, the sound.  You're not going to have that same  rumble.  You're not going to have that same sense of sound.  You're going  to hear your surroundings a lot better.  You can hear what's going on  around you but you're not going to have that roar.</p><p> Number two, the smell and the fumes of a gas bike aren't really going to be  there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is my cologne.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Which is your cologne.  It's not mine today.  It's not mine  today.  It's the reason -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  -- I'm stepping on further way.  But third, and I think most  important is all the -- all the vibration that you tend to feel with the  gas bike, you don't feel with an electric motorcycle.  So the only thing  you're really feeling is your connection to the road and the ride.  For me  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  These are made in the United States, made in America just like  the Harley, so is that a selling point, too.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It's a huge point for our consumers.  The bikes have been  engineered from the ground up, designed and are all built in the bay area,  in Northern California.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How -- what are your sales like year-over-year, how much are  they growing?</p><p> PASCHEL:  They were growing in about a 35 percent compound annual growth  rate.  It's similar to what's happening in the E.V. space.  And two  dynamics at play, one, is a motorcycle market that tends to be a bit flat.   The second is an E.V. market that's growing rapidly.  Luckily for us, we're  tending to follow a curved of the E.V. market.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about other products that you might be looking at outside  of motorcycles?</p><p> PASCHEL:  So, we have -- we have three basic business segments.  The first  is the commercial motorcycles which are for sale to consumers and  motorcycles for us --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I interviewed the founder of the company years ago when the  first bikes were rolling out.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Yes.  Neal was fantastic; he was a NASA-funded engineer at one  point, and a mountain bike and a motorcycle enthusiast.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  The second segment for us is fleets and military.  It's a great  application for local police forces.  And third is this powertrain  business, where their companies that realize they're a little bit behind  the curve on electrification, we've got millions of miles underneath the  bikes, we've got 11 years of experience and they're coming to us to help  them electrify the products that they have already created. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sam, good to see you.  Please come back.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  Thanks so much for having us.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I wish I would get on one but -- I'm not wearing my motorcycle  pants today.  Sam Paschel, thank you so much.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Thank you so much.  (INAUDIBLE) come out to California and we'll  get your leg throw over a bike.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, on a day like today, it's a little chilly, I'll take even  Northern California, the coldest place on the planet in the middle of July.   Thank you so much, Sam. </p><p> PASCHEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's really good to see you.  Coming up, final thoughts from our  all-stars. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't know why that song reminds me of Kevin Kelly but it  does.  Final thoughts right now.  Erin, to you first.</p><p> ELMORE:  I drank a whole Starbucks, it's obvious, Frappuccino, so I'm all  juiced up today.  My vote is for Trump to keep yelling as a (INAUDIBLE).   Have a happy weekend.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kevin?</p><p> KELLY:  I'm going to bring -- wear my piano key necktie next time I'm out  here, and also it's important to note that CVS, only 14.5 percent of their  customers use mail order subscription through their pharmacy, Amazon is  coming for you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Lea, final thoughts</p><p> GABRIELLE:  So the Congress, the budget resolution, well, that was due back  in April.  It's almost Halloween, if they get started on next year's now,  then they might get it done by Independence Day.  So I'd say, get it  moving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And here's my final thought to the people in Congress, the GOP  who are writing that house -- that tax reform bill, if you touch 401(k)  plans and make this market tank, you're going to own that, and you will  feel the wrath of President Trump for your remaining days in Congress.  A  big thanks to Erin Elmore, Kevin Kelly, and Lea Gabrielle.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  Mr. Varney starts right now with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p> Stuart, I don't know it if I'm early or late, but it's all yours.</p><p> VARNEY:  I'll take it.  I'll take it, Dagen, gratefully.  Thank you very  much indeed, Dagen.  All right.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p>The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p>Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p>Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p>That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p>In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p>And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p>Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p>And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p>KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p>By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p>But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p>That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p>This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p>The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p>So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p>What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p>Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p>So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p>Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p>But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p>I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p>And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p>So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p>Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p>As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p>So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p>Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p>So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p>So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p>I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p>They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p>We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p>And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p>A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p>But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p>So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p>Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p>In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p>Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p>Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p>But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p>KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p>I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p>ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p>ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p>ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p>And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p>And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p>They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p>Joining us now is --</p><p>SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p>What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p>This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p>So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p>Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p>401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p>And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p>And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p>So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p>And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p>Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p>ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p>If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p>XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p>Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p>The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p>The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p>A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p>PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p>Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p>The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p>If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p>And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p>But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p>THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p>There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p>We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p>Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p>And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p>Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p>MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p>TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p>JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p>TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p>Earnings blitz -- big names including Merck, ExxonMobil, Chevron all  reporting this morning.  Merck just hitting the tape, earnings of $1.11 a  share topping estimates while revenue missing expectations.  We see a  little move up to the stocks at least right here right now.</p><p>Budget passed -- the House making the move which is the key to any hope of  tax reform -- that hoping to get done this year.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross praising the passage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think the vote today told  you that they didn't put any amendments at all.  They took it exactly as it  came from the Senate even though they had been talking about quite a few  amendments.</p><p>The only reason they would have had to doing that is to grease the skids  for the tax cuts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting a deal done ahead.</p><p>Futures are showing gains across the board, certainly lifted by some  terrific numbers out of Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet and Amazon  yesterday evening.

Good to see you.  Good to see you, my man.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Loving it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're trying to rock out -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Rocking out on this Friday morning.  I mean especially with  technology killing it.  I mean think about this.  As your sales up 90  percent for Microsoft, Microsoft Office 365 -- revenues up 42 percent.   Technology is 23 percent of the overall markets so it's going to lead --  it's led it higher during the year.  It's going to lead it higher going  into the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen, Mr. Kelly.  Amen.  Coming up this morning New York Stock  Exchange President Tom Farley talks to Maria; Softbank investment adviser  CEO Rajeev Misra; and Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel; actor and director  Kevin Sorbo along with his wife Sam Sorbo.  You don't want to miss any of  those guests.</p><p>To our top story this hour however -- investors looking to earnings this  morning.  Colgate reporting just moments ago.  Earnings per share in line  with estimates at 73 cents; revenue beating expectations at $3.94 billion.   Investors also waiting on the first reading on how fast the economy was  growing last quarter.</p><p>This following the passage of the House budget vote yesterday, a key step  in paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>Joining us now, global economics editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Jon  Hilsenrath.  Jon -- what do you want to start with because earnings are -- </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How about  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- coming in better than expected but again -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- do, does Wall Street -- do investors need that tax reform to  really keep pushing stocks higher here?  Well, I mean I think they're going  to get some kind of tax reform.  We had -- the House passed the budget  yesterday.  That's another step towards completion.</p><p>They have a very aggressive timetable they are setting out in the House to  have a bill done by Thanksgiving.  I mean it's very ambitious but it looks  like they're moving in that direction.</p><p>I think really that's just whipped cream on top of the sundae at this point  because the earnings numbers are so good.  And as you said in your lead up,  you know, we're going to be getting economic growth numbers out tomorrow  and I think they're going to come in pretty strong as well.  We're looking  for something a little bit south of 3 percent; that's after 3.1 percent in  the second quarter.</p><p>The economy is doing pretty well right now.  It isn't gangbusters but it  sure is enough to keep the stock market going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's keeping it going?  Despite -- other than regulatory  reform out of the Trump administration, despite not move by Congress to  really tackle some major issues for the economy namely Obamacare and tax  cuts, tax reform.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, sometimes I think we put too much emphasis on  what's going on in Washington when things are going poorly and when things  are going well.</p><p>Right now, it's the whole world.  What we have is a very unusual  synchronized global upturn.  The European economy has just -- has started  turning up again after spending most of the last decade in a funk.</p><p>The Japanese economy is turning up too -- up again.  You know, we talk to  people there who say their equipment sales are rising because they're  selling more into the United States.</p><p>Emerging markets are picking up.  We have really a sweet spot in the global  economy and big multinational American companies like the tech guys who  reported yesterday are benefiting from it.</p><p>KELLY:  Jon -- are you concerned about the dollar though and the strength  of it?  And should we get higher interest rates going forward?  I mean  you've seen the 10-year tick up.  It's Kevin, by the way.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Are you worried about this global story that you are talking about.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think in a moment like this when the dollar  is strong you have to say -- you have to ask why is it strong?  You know,  why is it picking up?</p><p>We have the dollar picking up because the U.S. economy is in good shape and  because earnings for American companies are there.  So that's good news.   You know, does that, you know, maybe tone down the benefits to the export  sector, yes a little bit.</p><p>But when the global economy is doing well our exporters are going to do  well, too.  So I don't think a strong dollar is a sign of weakness in a  moment like this.  I think it's a sign of strength.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, I want to move on to the Federal Reserve.  I make a list  every morning of things that I think are important to talk about.  And I  made a list and it was earnings and it was the Federal Reserve chief.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump is looking to choose a new Fed chair potentially  when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.  Fox Business' Lou Dobbs sat  down with the President to discuss the candidates.  Watch this and I want  your reaction.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do you have a preference,  out of curiosity.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST:  I do and -- </p><p>TRUMP:  Tell me who your preference is.  I only want that from people I  respect.</p><p>DOBBS:  I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I'll tell you what.  She was in my office three days ago.  She's  very impressive.  I like her a lot.</p><p>In one way I have to say you like to make your own mark.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>TRUMP:  You understand that.</p><p>DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  You like to make your own mark which is maybe one of the things  she's got a little bit against her.  But I think she's terrific.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon -- you've covered the Federal Reserve for years.  You were  the man on the fed that everybody had to listen to.  What do you think?  Do  you have any sense of who the new Fed chief will be?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we spend so much time in the office right now  trying to figure out what's going on inside of Donald Trump's head.</p><p>You know, when you look at clips like when I hear it, I wasn't looking at  it, but when I hear it he sounds like he is very impressed with Janet  Yellen.  And you've got to ask yourself, why would he change horses in the  middle of the race that he's winning right now when growth is picking up,  unemployment is down, stock prices are at record highs.</p><p>But at the same time is he said in that clip with Lou, you know, there  seems to be some desire in the President's head and also inside the White  House to put his own mark on the place, to find his own person.</p><p>So I think -- I think he is really struggling -- not struggling but I think  he is really thinking carefully through this choice and through the pros  and cons of whether to keep her or whether to let her go.  He certainly -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Jon -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- is giving her a close look.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The conventional wisdom is if John Taylor is the next of Fed  chief that he's going to be more aggressive at raising interest rates. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump is a real estate guy.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody in real estate doesn't really like higher interest  rates.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's very fixated on the performance of the stock market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is one reason why I think we've been hammering possible  changes to 401(k) plans.  That's why it resonated with him. He's like why  are you going to mess with something that could cause the market to tank?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>And that brings you back to Janet Yellen.  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The compromise candidate for him is Jay Powell, a governor at  the Fed right now who's basically been right at Janet Yellen's side with  every decision that she's made, you know.</p><p>So you've got to -- you've got to believe that if he picks Jay Powell, he's  getting a Republican.  He's also getting someone who is going to keep  interest rates relatively low.  But then that bring you back to the  question of well, if he's going to bring someone's who's going to look like  Janet Yellen in the policies that he pursues why not just bring back Janet  Yellen?</p><p>You know, we're going to know within the next week.  They say he's going to  make a decision before he leaves for Asia next week.  So we can stop having  this conversation and start talking about whether he made a good decision  or a bad decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon -- good to see you as always.  Jon Hilsenrath -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Sure thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- I love how you said that like you're sitting in the \"Wall  Street Journal\" Washington bureau talking about what's in President Trump's  head.  Don't we all?</p><p>Actually, you know what -- usually -- thank you Jon.  Thinking of that we  don't really need to guess because he will tell -- President Trump will  tell you what's in his head.</p><p>And he just tweeted.  \"Wacky and totally unhinged Tom Steyer who has been  fighting me and my make America great again agenda from the beginning never  wins elections.\"</p><p>For background Steyer is a billionaire who is spending $10 million on a  national ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.  There you  have it.</p><p>More from the President I'm sure on Twitter and we'll bring you that as  soon as it happens.</p><p>Still ahead shedding new light on the shot heard around the world.   Declassified after decades -- we'll delve deeper into the newly released  files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p><p>Plus rolling back prices and rolling out robots -- how Wal-Mart is using  futuristic new technology to keep shelves stocked at dozens of stores  across the country.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news President Trump just tweeting, \"Congratulations to  Speaker Ryan, GOP leader, Steve Scalise and to the Republican Party on  budget passage yesterday.  Now the biggest tax cuts.\"</p><p>I love how he refers to it as tax cuts now.</p><p>The truth coming out -- numerous JFK assassination files have been  released.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest details -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there -- Dagen.  Good morning to  you.  A Red Bull morning here in the nation's capital when you think about  it the 2,800 documents released last night.  These are previously redacted  and classified documents.  And I apologize for all the noise as the leaf  blower goes by here a few times every morning right around the time I talk  to you.</p><p>But let me tell you what happened last night and this is actually a pretty  important story.  It's about the documents related to the assassination of  President Kennedy.</p><p>I think the real headline though would be the fact that many of the records  were withheld due to national security concerns, according to a memo from  the President.</p><p>Now, do keep this in mind.  Those documents contain raw intelligence.   That's uncorroborated and that's likely going to speculate -- or rather  fuel more speculation about the plot to kill the President.  We do learn a  lot about the frustration of FBI chief Herbert Hoover at Cuba's possible  role as well.</p><p>Let me share just a bit of a White House statement.  They talk about those  records that were not released overnight -- 2,800 documents.  Some people  would say it's just a drop in the bucket.  The remaining records will be  released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming  weeks.</p><p>The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from agencies,  directed them to minimize redactions without delay.  And this is an  important one from the CIA -- every single one of the approximately 18,000  remaining CIA records in the collection will ultimately be released with no  document withheld in full.  That is great.  That's a boon if you're a  researcher in particular. </p><p>Now that promise could shed more light about Lee Harvey Oswald, his trips  to Mexico before the assassination and, of course, the Castro regime  including U.S. efforts, by the way, to topple the communist dictator.</p><p>There are a number of days that we are keeping an eye on, Dagen, as we look  forward to the rolling release of these documents.  I want to point your  attention to April 26, 2018.  That's when we expect another big batch.  In  the meantime -- researchers rock on and see what you can find out.</p><p>Back to you with my friend in that bloody leaf blower -- got to love this  guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Leaf blowers are as frightening as chainsaws and louder.  Kevin  -- you did a great job.  It's great to see you.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House.</p><p>Still ahead -- courting Aramco -- the president of the New York Stock  Exchange sitting down with Maria at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia to talk about what they're doing to land potentially the  biggest initial public offering of all-time.</p><p>Then Instagram getting up close and personal -- the dramatic new feature  coming to the social media app.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia our own Maria  Bartiromo was able to sit down with New York Stock Exchange president Tom  Farley and get his take on everything from the Trump effect on the market  to the magnitude of the expected Saudi Aramco IPO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  And joining me right now is the president of  the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE president Tom Farley.  Tom -- it's good  to see you.</p><p>TOM FARLEY, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's great to be back with  you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARLEY:  -- in this beautiful hall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The hall in Saudi Arabia.  It's really incredible to me how  many people in investment management, business people are here in Saudi  this week.</p><p>FARLEY:  Yes.  I mean I was just waiting to sit down with you and impromptu  was able to have a conversation with Secretary Mnuchin, Steve Schwarzman,  Howard Marks.  And it is the great and the good of financing and finance  all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, one of the big reasons obviously is this Saudi  Aramco deal.  They are going to take their state oil company public --  could be the biggest IPO ever.  It could be up to $75 billion.</p><p>You have Alibaba which is what -- a $24 billion deal.  This would be a huge  piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>FARLEY:  So, you know, people see me in the halls here as the head of the  New York Stock Exchange.  Everyone assumes that my relationship is totally  about the Aramco IPO.  I've actually known the -- from the minister level  to the company Saudi Aramco -- I've known the company for many years long  before the IPO was even a notion because as you know the New York Stock  Exchange is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the largest energy exchange  in the world.  I'm one of the managers of that business and Saudi Aramco is  a partner and a customer in that respect.</p><p>Regarding the IPO, we will compete for any IPO of a great global business.   I can't say too much about Saudi Aramco in particular other than anyone you  meet from the company or the ministry -- and I know you've met several of  them just this week.  They are professional.  They are sophisticated.  And  no surprise, they are carrying out a very disciplined, due diligence  process to make the right decision for Saudi Arabia as a whole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think you're going to get the deal.</p><p>FARLEY:  I'm not going to comment in particular because I don't want to  prejudice any decision that they make.  But for any great global IPO, look,  first of all we want them to make the right decision for them.  We won't  try to corner them in to make something we think is a wrong decision.</p><p>Clearly the New York Stock Exchange is the leading exchange in the world  for listings.  We have something like $34 trillion of market caps.  The  next closest exchange is a tiny, tiny fraction of that.</p><p>And so in terms of the deepest liquidity in the world that's in the United  States.  Brand name -- you get that from the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  also a rigorous governance test to be listed in the New York Stock  Exchange.  So if you list there, you're holding yourself out to be a very  well-run, well-governed company.</p><p>That is kind of the decision criteria that benefits what the New York Stock  Exchange brings.  But I have no doubt other exchanges around the world have  their own unique benefits as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the implications of such a huge deal?  I mean if  you're looking at Alibaba being the biggest deal at $24 billion and this  deal is as high as $75 billion, give us a sense.  Give our viewers a sense  of why this is so important and what the global implications are for a  company this size to go public or to sell 5 percent of it to the public?</p><p>FARLEY:  So large IPOs are nerve-racking.  We do them a lot.  Of the top 20  IPOs of all time, I think the number is 13 have been on the New York Stock  Exchange.  And even those companies that fall on the other seven many of  them have ultimately listed in the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>We know a lot about big deals and the New York Stock Exchange is purpose- built for those big deals.  We combine humans and technology but we still  spend a lot of time getting ready for those IPOs because there is a lot of  bids and offers that come in that.  There's a lot of complexity on that  moment the stock opens.  And you need to make sure that stock opens  smoothly so that the management team of the IPO doesn't spend the next six  months or two years explaining what went wrong on IPO day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you what you're seeing right now at the New York  Stock Exchange in terms of listings.  Obviously there has always been a  massive competition between NYSE and Nasdaq.  What can you tell us in terms  of business year-to-date?</p><p>FARLEY:  Well, apropos of our interview location halfway around the world  from our normal home base, our shared home base it's a very global story.   The IPO market is booming in the U.S. and at the New York Stock Exchange.   We've had twice as many roundabouts, twice as many IPOs as all of last  year.  We've had this year twice as much in terms of dollar value and from  all around the world.</p><p>Last week alone we had a great company from Southeast Asia and we had  another company from China.  This week we have an Argentinian company, next  week a Brazilian company.  And so we are seeing great global companies  choosing the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing more global companies relative to the U.S.?   Because the truth is there are a lot of start-ups who are saying, you know  what, I don't want to go public.  The regulatory environment is too tight.   And I'm not going to.</p><p>So that's why there was a problem.  People were wondering why the IPO  market was not so busy earlier this year.  The start-ups were not going  public.  </p><p>FARLEY:  I'm glad you asked that.  You know, the American audience likes to  make a big deal out of a story.  There are not as many American tech  companies going public.  And that's true.  Some of the great American tech  companies have chosen to stay private.</p><p>The last week alone, we had a young man who started a company three years  ago to provide a technology that allows for consumer lending in China --  that company is now worth over $10 billion.  It's an amazing tech story.   And the Friday company, too was a technology company that offers gaming, e- commerce and payments from Singapore.  We just don't talk about it as much  frankly because it's not American.</p><p>But these are great tech companies choosing to go public, choosing the New  York Stock Exchange fortunately.  I'm appreciative that they did choose the  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here is a stat for you -- listed public companies in the  U.S. down 50 percent over 20 years because of the regulatory environment.   I mean the President has said he is calling for IPOs, the bar for IPOs to  be lowered.  </p><p>The Treasury came out with a report. They're basically saying the  regulatory environment is way too hard for companies to go public.</p><p>What are you doing in terms of lowering the bar, in terms of lowering the  standards, making it easier for companies to go public?</p><p>FARLEY:  You know, I think you are referring to our press report that came  out.  And if you work your way down that press report the next paragraph  starts with some of the efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and I  personally have engaged in, to push the administration to make it easier to  engage in IPOs.</p><p>You mentioned the number of public companies.  It is down by about half.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  But the average market cap is up by over three times -- The  aggregate market cap.  So the average company is five or six times bigger.   The public market works great for big companies.  It's not working as well  for small companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p>FARLEY:  And we need to acknowledge that because small companies are the  life blood of free enterprise.  They give the inspiration to even smaller  companies.  They create jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what can you do?  What can you do to get more small  companies to go public then?</p><p>FARLEY:  Simple things.  The pendulum has swung too far on regulation with  Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Big companies can handle it.  Small  companies can't.  So if you can allow the small companies during the IPO  process to meet more with investors and analysts, you can reduce the  Sarbanes-Oxley requirements on small companies.</p><p>Like for example, not require an external audit for the first few years  that a company is public.  And you could extend that to all new companies  not just the tiniest ones but expand the envelope a little bit and have it  be for all new companies that are new to public market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean one thing is create a longer window of time in  which companies can be in the emerging growth category.</p><p>FARLEY:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  Exactly.  And what that emerging market growth category does is it  just requires less regulation for small companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FARLEY:  You know, regulation is like taxes.  No regulation isn't the  answer and complete government control isn't the answer -- somewhere in  between is the right answer, and the pendulum is going to swing.  We have  swung too far towards heavily regulating small companies and we need to  swing it back aggressively to make sure that that IPO engine is there for  those young entrepreneurs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the sentiment feel like to you when you go down on  the floor, when you speak to big investors?  Because how do you like the  way the President is constantly tweeting that market has gained $5.3  trillion in market value since Election Day?  We are at record highs --  23000 and counting.</p><p>Do you feel like things are getting overheated?  Do you feel the same  sentiment when you talk to investors that you did a year ago?</p><p>FARLEY:  I walk in on the floor and I look up at the indices every morning  and it's amazing what has happened since November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't you think?</p><p>FARLEY:  We're 17400 that night, if you remember because the indices really  cratered and now they had zipped back up.  However I will note, it's also a  global story.  This isn't just America.  In the last two weeks alone the  DAX, the CAC, the (INAUDIBLE) -- they have all hit all-time highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>FARLEY:  So there is a really -- this is a really good moment globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you feel like sentiment is still there?  The bullishness  or are people getting worried that things are getting over priced?</p><p>FARLEY:  People are bullish.  That doesn't mean there won't be a pullback  but people are bullish without question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Tom -- it's great to see  you.</p><p>FARLEY:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FARLEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Farley is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up rebuilding Puerto Rico -- 80 percent of the island is  still without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

The futuristic new  tech coming to Walmart to ensure that shelves are always stocked.</p><p>To our stop story this half hour.  The crisis in Puerto Rico.  Two house  committees and a federal watchdog are now investigating the $300 million  no-bid contract that was awarded to Whitefish Energy holdings to repair  Puerto Rico's flattened electrical grid.</p><p>Critics say Whitefish has little experience repairing electricity  infrastructure.  And alleged the company has ties to interior secretary,  Ryan Zinke.</p><p>Joining us now is the spokesman of Whitefish Energy Holdings, Ken Luce.   Ken, what do you say to these investigations?  Are they warranted?</p><p>KEN LUCE, SPOKESMAN, WHITEFISH ENERGY HOLDINGS:  No.  The investigations  are not warranted.  First off, PREPA hired a firm Whitefish Energy who has  extensive experience fixing transmission lines, especially in the  mountains, which is our assignment.  Our assignment is 100 miles of  transmission lines mostly in the mountains of Puerto Rico, which are  necessary to restore the power ultimately overtime.</p><p>The real issue congress should be asking is where are the other firms that  the core and CORE and FEMA are hiring to come to the island to help repair  the grid?  Those contracts were just let last week.  Meaning, it's another  two or three weeks before more help us to the island.  That's the  frustration in Puerto Rico is the resources are not there yet.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And part of the controversy is that  Whitefish only had two full-time employees as reported when Maria hit  Puerto Rico on September 20th and then since hired all these employees.</p><p>You have a pretty robust experience in PR.  When did the company hire you?</p><p>LUCE:  The company hired us two ago.  But again, the point here is the  entire industry ramps up when you get contracts.  Whitefish has experience  in the mountains which is why we were hired.</p><p>If you have a question about that, and the business practice of ramping up  much like homebuilders, consulting firms and others do, look at the results  to date.  320 people are already on the island, lineman and engineers,  repairing the grid.  So if there's a question, then look at the facts.</p><p>My real issue is no one has asked the questions and then reported the  facts.  There's just this jump to say nothing's being done which is  inaccurate.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  What are the facts that you think aren't being reported?</p><p>LUCE:  Well, I mean, the fact you have two employees and you have a  business model that ramps up just like hundreds of firms in the United  States and all over the world.  And you now have 320 employees.</p><p>So if you question a two-person firm with the ability, look at their  experience which is working in mountainous regions and the CEO is leading  that effort in Puerto Rico today and we have 320 people on the ground in  less than three weeks.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Ken.  Erin Elmore here.   There were also allegations -- </p><p>LUCE:  Hi.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi.  How are you?  There were also allegations that interior  secretary, Ryan Zinke's son had an internship at Whitefish.  What do you  say about that?  And is there any correlations there that are troubling?</p><p>LUCE:  No.  He did.  He was a flagger.  So he directed traffic on a summer  job through a friend.  But to say the interior secretary had anything to do  with the contract, number one, it's not true.  Everyone has said so.  He  found out about the contract after it was let.  And he also has no  authority over FEMA, the CORE, PREPA, so again there's a jump today to  guilt versus facts.</p><p>And then the other part of that is, if you really look at the political  landscape in Puerto Rico, an interior secretary and the current  administration would not necessarily be popular in Puerto Rico where the  majority of the population supported the other party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Jen, these investigations aren't going away or at least  inquiries, two health committees, a federal watchdog investigating the  contract, the $300 million, no bid contract.  The governor of Puerto Rico  Rossello, says his administration will soon audit the contract awarded to  Whitefish.  And there's a retired air force colonel appointed to oversee  the reconstruction of the electoral grid following concerns over this very  contract.</p><p>So a lot of eyes on Whitefish now.</p><p>LUCE:  And again, we, welcome them.  Every member of congress should have  the information that they're asking for.  And we will certainly give that  out, but the first thing is, there were no questions asked.  Everybody  jumped to a conclusion based on the \"Washington Post\" article and no one  called.  We reached out to offices before this happened and said, if you  want information, we're more than happy to give it to you.</p><p>The contract with PREPA was done correctly.  PREPA has a company working on  the island and the current administration does not had those resources  there yet.  We welcome it and at the end, I'm just hoping people report  that there was nothing there.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, the director of Puerto Rico's power company has been  quoted saying that part of the reason that Whitefish was selected as the  only company that didn't require a down payment.</p><p>So I wanted to ask.  This does require a lot of money.  So, how well and  how was -- hos is Whitefish finance for this?</p><p>LUCE:  Well, Whitefish is very well capitalized.  They had financing from  several private equity firms.  They have met all their obligations to date.</p><p>But let me go back.  There was a very small deposit.  It was $2 million, I  believe.  There were another firm that also wanted to work, but required 10  to 15 times that amount to begin to work.</p><p>So capitalization isn't an issue.  We have 300 people working on the  island.  We have barges coming over every day.

The new feature bringing drama to  your storyline.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More Trump tweets, breaking news right now.  Here is from the  president.  \"JFK files are being carefully released and there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to public.\"</p><p>It's not going to stop the conspiracy theory.  It was only -- all these  documents are only going to make people lose their minds.</p><p>Meantime, the FBI is set to give congress documents related to the  controversial Russian dossier that we now know the democrats and the in the  Hillary Clinton were behind.  Cheryl Casone has that story.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  About that right, Dagen?  House Speaker, Paul Ryan says the  FBI has agreed to provide documents long stopped by congress in a variety  of investigations including information about a 35-page research document  containing unverified allegations about President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, U.S. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The FBI got in  touch with us yesterday afternoon and they has -- they have informed us  that they will comply with our document requests and that they will provide  the documents congress has been asking for by next week and we expect the  FBI to honor that commitment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that both Clinton campaign chairman  John Podesta and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denied to  congressional investigators that they had any knowledge about who paid for  the dossier.  That testimony could put them in hot water, as it came a week  before it was revealed that in fact democrats had paid for part of it.</p><p>Podesta and Schultz could face perjury charges if it turns out they gave  false statements to congress.</p><p>OK.  Switching gears.  A 10-year-old, 10-year-old.  Leading police on a  dangerous high-speed chase that hit 100 miles an hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Leaving off-road, driving down the (inaudible) get back  on the highway.

Break the window.</p><p>CASONE (voice-over):  Yes, all this went down yesterday morning in Ohio.   Cleveland Police say they saw the boy's car speed by, chased by another car  possibly driven his mother.</p><p>The 15-mile chase lasted less than an hour.  It finally ended after a  trooper was able to nudge the car into that sign, as you can see here with  his cruiser.  The kid was boxed in.  The kid was taken into custody.   Police say this same little boy stole his mother's Dodge Charger for a spin  and went down Interstate 90 earlier this month.  Yes, all right.</p><p>Instagram, introducing a new feature called Super Zoom.  Users can create  dramatic zoom and shots and you can set it to music.  This is the second  big update from Instagram this week.</p><p>Just days ago, they launched a live together feature.  Users can stream  live with friends.

And those are your speedy headlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's insane.  And I think we should point out it's just  a miracle that nobody was hurt whether, it's the kid or a passenger in  another car, a driver in another car.  I want to point that out.</p><p>But in terms of this Instagram feature, Erin just changed my life when she  told me about this.  An app.  It's called YouCam Perfect.  It basically  edits your face.  And it's literally if you take a selfie, it takes about  20 years off my age.</p><p>Elmore:  I told you were never going to be the same again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I need to buy you -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Because now people can be using it when they're on their dating  websites.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You couldn't tell like way better than they actually do.</p><p>ELMORE:  It's just you only refreshed with a good night sleep.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Exactly.  I'm sure the person who meets up with you feel that  way too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the cancer center with my mother where I never wear any  makeup.

I'm like, OK,  thanks.</p><p>If only there's a filter we could walk around with an everyday life.  You  hand it to people.</p><p>Still ahead, let there be light.  Actor and director, Kevin Sorbo joining  us with his wife Sam Sorbo, to talk about their new movie shining a light  on the crisis of faith.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hollywood sexual harassment secrets revealed.  Our next guests,  \"Hercules\" actor, Kevin Sorbo, says he too was a victim.  Joining us now is  Kevin and his actress wife, Sam.  They're here to talk about their new  movie.</p><p>But, first, I wanted to talk about -- because you have come out and said  that you -- that Gianni Versace hit on him.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO, AMERICAN ACTOR:  In my book and it happened years ago.  It's  already in my book.  It's not like a secret.  I didn't suffer any trauma  from it but I'm not taking with the people who have, because it's out  there.  Look at them.  I'm a big dude.  Most people in Hollywood aren't  going to -- they're not going to kid on me.  They're afraid of me.</p><p>The most male actors are five-eight.  I'm a big guy.</p><p>SAM SORBO, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  What's amazing is to see now this sorted --  the sorted underbelly of Hollywood coming out.  And we have a film that's  coming out tonight and it's almost the antisepsis of that, right?  Produced  outside of Hollywood with Sean Hannity, as you know.  Not funded by  Hollywood at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fox News Channel, so he -- we have to disclose that.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  He's on the Fox News Channel.  No, it's true and so we're kind  of excited that -- because this film takes a different one.  This is the --  this is the film that Hollywood used to produce.  The uplifting film.  The  film with Godly character.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Prior to the '60s, Hollywood produced, character-driven  movies.  And now, it's changed.  They celebrate antihero.  They celebrate  sort of the negativity in life.  It's just weird to me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think it's a stretch to say this that with Hollywood and  people in that industry broadly speaking that there's a disconnect between  individual and family and faith.</p><p>And that that -- it is largely an industry that is if they don't -- faith  is not front and center if people go to church regularly.  And so, do you  think that that opened the door for greater sexual harassment over decades?   And I'm not naming any individual.  But it's a lack connection to God and  higher power.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  It's actually -- it's a different face.  OK.  If you think of  it as a non-faith -- </p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Every movie is faith-based movie.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  Their face is different.  They put faith in Darwinism and  evolution and survival of the fittest, which is what Harvey Weinstein did.   Survival of the fittest.  He took what he wanted and he got it.  And  sometimes they made him pay for it and he was cool with that.  And it was  business as usual and everybody who knew about it was perfectly fine with  it.  It's a completely different face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You worship at the altar of filth.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Yes.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  And so in our movie, we juxtapose the two, right?  We have two  people who are grieving and one of them worships at the altar of self.   He's basically an egomaniac.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  That's my character.  Yes, he's not a very good guy.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  And his ex-wife.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  But he's a lost man.  He's lost.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  He's lost.  And an ex-wife who is faithful and goes to church  and is raising their two boys in the Christian faith.  And so we juxtapose  the two.  And you can walk it alone or you can walk it with higher power  and you see the difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to watch this clip:  \"Let There Be Light.\"  Opens  nationwide today.  Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM SORBO:  What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of  their brother and using his part of your carnival act?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  It pays the bills.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Daddy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clinically dead in entrance for four minutes.  It's a  miracle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's incredible.  And you wrote it, Sam.  You co-wrote the  script.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  I co-wrote it with Dan Gordon who's a very well-known Hollywood  screenwriter and I was -- I was lucky that he jumped right on board when he  heard the idea.  And then two weeks later, out of the blue Sean calls Kevin  and says.</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Sean gave me a call and says, hey, I want to do movie with  you.  I love your got -- what soul-searching movie.  And I said, we got  one.  And we included in the arc and boom.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to put you on the spot.  Is this your favorite project  you've ever worked on?  Especially you work with your wife and she co-wrote  it?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Well, there's questions, one of my favorite ones.  It's in  the top five.  I've done between Hercules and a drama and then -- and then  54 movies.  I've done a lot of work.</p><p>I mean, but I'm very fortunate that I'm still working, because certainly  coming out of the conservative Christian closet in Hollywood for an  industry this of tolerance and freedom of speech, it's pretty much a one- way street with them.  So I've been very lucky to keep working.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  People can go to lettherebelightmovie.com.  They can find out  what theaters it's playing.  And if it's not playing in the theater near  you, I urge people to go, call the theaters or go to the website and  organize group tickets.</p><p>We found that there's a little bit of a threshold, higher thresholds for  faith-based films being booked into theaters.  If they're looking for some  sort of proof, some sort of presales and stuff, that they don't typically  look for in non-faith movies -- </p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Well, that's kind of typical for small independent movies.   It really is that way, if you don't have a big budget to promote.</p><p>SAM SORBO:  The idea with movies is, movies are storytelling.  They shape  the culture.  Hollywood shapes our culture.  Do we want the culture of  Hollywood to trickle down into this culture?  Do we want the culture of  Harvey Weinstein to be pervasive in the U.S. culture?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Kevin.  Are you finding though that people are more  receptive to conservative, more receptive to people who are kind of wear  their faith on the outside as a lot of people and other parts of the  Hollywood?</p><p>KEVIN SORBO:  Let me tell you something.  I travel a lot.  One to airports.   Wherever I'm on streets, cities, no matter where I am, people walk up to me  now, not because of \"Hercules\" and drama, they walk to me because of  (INAUDIBLE) please make more movies like this.</p><p>So if they want to see more movies like this, they have to support them,  because like I said, we don't have the big budget to bring these out there.   And movies like this become successful because of word-of-mouth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam and Kevin Sorbo and you can see -- I'm on \"Outnumbered\"  today.  I'm lucky, guys.  So I'll be very nice.  I promise.  Thank you both  so much.</p><p>Still ahead, exed out.  Apple's iPhone 10 selling out already.  Presales  started earlier today.  When can you get it and how much will you pay?   More head.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  And  it's Friday, October 27th.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Earnings extravaganza, big names including Merck, ExxonMobil,  Chevron, all reporting this morning.  This comes after stellar, earnings  yesterday afternoon from tech giants, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent  Alphabet all delivering better-than-expected results.  Amazon shares  jumping on the news, CEO Jeff Bezos made about $6 billion extra on that  move.  Not the only good news for that retailer, the company gaining  wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states.  The part of driving force  behind CVS making a deal to buy health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66  billion.</p><p>The futures are showing begins across the board this morning.  We have a  32-point gain on the Dow futures, held higher by Microsoft stock again on  those positive earnings and also Intel, two Dow components.  We have gains  across the board.  Later this hour we get the first reading on fast U.S.  economy was growing in the third quarter.  The first reading on third- quarter GDP.  Investors also eyeing key developments out of Washington  including the House passing a budget and we have Exxon earnings coming in  right now.  Looking double beat, 66.17 billion on the revenue line and then  also earnings per share coming in higher as well.  93 cents a share on  Exxon versus an estimate of 86 cents a share.  So, a double beat on Exxon  and, again, those earnings growth in the energy sector from a year ago  gangbusters, so up triple-digit gains on earnings there.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump tweeting on the matter this morning saying, I'll  be talking about the House budget.  Congratulations to Speaker Ryan, GOP  Leader Steve Scalise and Republican Party on budget passage yesterday, now  the biggest tax cuts.  Moving on to new details behind the JFK  assassination, the White House allowing the release of thousands of  previously blocked records, the staggering revelation including a possible  warning nearly 30 minutes ahead of the tragedy.  And iPhone lovers braving  their early morning hours to order the iPhone 10.  The latest as preorders  for the highly-anticipated device go up online.  And Apple needs a winner  because those iPhone 8 sales, the slowest for a new device in years.  </p><p>The greatest of all time taking the wheel, the staggering amount it will  cost you to drive a special edition Aston-Martin designed by really?   Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.  That's right.  What can the man not do?   I'm joking.  And here with me to break it all down, Fox News Correspondent  Lea Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate, Erin Elmore.  Lovely to  be with you.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  I just want to say the Aston-Martin  comes with fully inflated tires.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh, hey yow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get down.</p><p>KELLY:  That's right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the wife in the -- in the passenger seat nagging.  His wife  rather.</p><p>KELLY:  Does she nag?  I haven't heard her say a word ever.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Nag.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  The one thing we didn't say is that Stephanie Pomboy is going to be  here and she is one of our favorite economists especially when it comes to  GDP and she will give coverage and read-throughs that no one else has on  the streets.  She's my favorite person when she comes in.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, you see, here is how it goes every morning since she do  the short show almost like two times a week.  We introduce the panel, and  then we promo the guests.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you just stepped on my promo.</p><p>KELLY:  I know, I know.  But I'm just so excited. </p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I thought I was just sober for coming  on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So he just -- so Kevin just stepped on this promo but we do have  SoftBank investment, Rajeev Misra coming up, SoftBank adviser/CEO, Maria  talked to him yesterday.  Sam Paschel, Zero Motorcycle CEO and \"VARNEY AND  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Don't miss -- and Stephanie Pomboy at the  bottom of the hour.  But busy earning season continues with two big oil  companies reporting.  We just had Exxon earnings hitting the tape, earnings  per share of 93 cents topping expectations.  Revenue also a beat.  Kevin  Kelly, your thoughts on the energy sector because again, this is huge surge  in earnings off the bottom a year -- near the bottom a year ago.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And that highlights the effect of what's really driving the  earning season this year because the energy sector was so depressed when  you think about where oil was even a year ago.  You had 25, 30, $35.00,  $45.00 a barrel of oil.  Now we stayed now consistently above 50 but that  hasn't played through yet.  So one of the interesting aspects is we're  going to want to see what guidance is going forward.  Investors are solely  focused on the effects of the hurricanes that are going to be in Chevron as  well as the Exxon.  What they see going forward where they are in terms of  cost cuts, that's been a very, very big focus for them because a lot of  times, the cost of oil a barrel is higher for a lot of these integrated  when you're thinking Exxon, Chevron, right?  So they're in -- they're all  over the globe, and so because there has been a depression of prices  globally that's affecting them, the last thing is also what they're going  to do M&amp;A wise.  People are worried that they need to start buying  companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory backdrop because we always focus on  Washington and what the Congress hasn't done on health care and taxes but  in terms of the regulation rollback that is something the Trump  administration has been on top of and that does particularly help energy  companies.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  That really helps energy companies and they've even spoken  about that on their investor and conference call all year long.  They're  waiting for actually even more deregulation to happen in the space  especially for them to deploy more of their capital because we've seen coal  as actually done really well this year and the supplies are up and people  are using it more especially with renewable energies and a lot of tax  credits that are flowing through on there.  So a lot -- a lot of policy  coming out of Washington is going to dictate what happens to these  companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google on track  for record highs today.  Amazon stock also getting a boost; Microsoft and  Intel really pushing up the Dow futures this morning.  You look at these  stocks go and Amazon on the news that not just earnings but Amazon is  getting into the pharmacy business or it's gotten approval for wholesale  pharmacy licenses and at least dozens stays.  This comes as the Wall Street  Journal, Kevin, is reporting that giant drugstore chain CVS is in talks to  buy the third largest insurer in the country.  Aetna for $66 billion.  This  CVS deal is in direct response to Amazon, is that right?  What other kinds  of deals could we be looking at in response to Amazon's move into more and  more businesses?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And this really is a shot across the bow because if you think  about what did Amazon do that was of the most significant recently, they  bought Whole Foods, right?  So with getting the state licenses, with  pharmacies can they start distributing -- basically prescription drugs  through their whole partnership and logistics with Whole Foods.  So you see  CVS actually now striking out and looking to do a deal with Aetna and  insurer which they have no experience in.  So this is actually pretty  telling.  We're going to see this story play out over the next couple  quarters, not years.  There is going to be a lot of activity and we're  going to get a lot of activity and we're going to get a lot of direction  that's coming through on that.  And you can see, Amazon is fighting, Wal- Mart toe-to-toe and especially when in the next leg of fight with them is  in the -- is in the prescription drug business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is a huge business.</p><p>ELMORE:  Prices can come way down.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are some drug packages like with Medicare prescription  drug packages packages, the part D that you can only buy prescriptions at  like major pharmacy like you aren't able and allowed to go and buy -- get  prescriptions at smaller like local pharmacy.  You literally have to.   Where I'm from you have to go to Wal-Mart.  It's the only place you can go.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  And the Whole -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again trying to break up that juggernaut.</p><p>KELLY:  And Amazon's idea behind this is the description model.  So people  don't need to continuously go to the pharmacy if they have a physical  presence and then they can get that subscription.  They'll figure out the  delivery and like I said, with their logistic systems that they do have  with Whole Foods.</p><p>ELMORE:  And the delivery is a great idea for people that are homebound or  wheelchair bound, things like that, it's also helping that market, they  really can't help themselves, so I think that's really nice for us people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with this CVS acquisition of Aetna in terms of what it could  potentially do expanding, basically giving a huge number of new customers  through Aetna for its pharmacy benefit management business bolstering its  leverage in negotiation for drug with drug makers in terms of pricing power  and then also you strike deals with -- to tie drug prices to patient  outcomes which is also incredible.  I want to move on to Washington, this  time, it's about truth coming out of D.C.  Numerous JFL assassination filed  released.  Blake Burman is at the White House with the very latest.  Blake,  good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  And this was nearly 2900 additional documents relating to  President Kennedy and his assassination that were produce last night by the  National Archives, not all the documents though within this last batch  though were put forward as the president said in a memo that \"Certain  information should continue to be redacted because of national security,  law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.\"  These newest documents  though do shed more details about the events surrounding the assassination  of JFK.  For example, one shows that a British reporter received a phone  call about 25 minutes before President Kennedy was shot and was told that  there would be impending \"Big news.\"  </p><p>Another detail show an FBI source then claimed days later that the Soviet  Union was fearful that a missile could head their way because of the  actions of an irresponsible U.S. general.  This final batch of the last set  of documents has to be released now by the end of April.  And President  Trump tweeted out moments ago the following, he said and I quote, \"JFK  files are being carefully released.  In the end, there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to the public.\"   For now, Dagen if you need good some good reading, you're just curious or  whatever it might be, all you have to do is head on over to National  Archives Web site, the documents are listed right there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm tempted, I am really tempted when I came out I was  (INAUDIBLE)I got other stuff I need to read.  So yes, weekend reading.   Thank you so much --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURMAN:  It will be there for a while.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  Great to see you as always.   Preorders for the iPhone selling out in just minutes, overnight.  What it  means for anyone trying to get their hands on this hot device.  The release  date is technically November the 3rd but what if you need it before  Christmas or the holidays?  And nobody can drive down the field like Tom  Brady but at least you can drive down the road like the Patriots superstar.   The hot new ride from Aston-martin inspired by the greatest of all time.</p><p>KELLY:  Not.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Preorders for the Apple 10 iPhone starting today but you might  have trouble getting yours in.  Cheryl Casone has more details on this.   Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Hey, Dagen.  Sources saying supplies of the hot  new phone are sold out, shipping estimates slipping well beyond the  November 3rd launch date here in the U.S. on Apple's Web site five to six  weeks right now.  According to one report by the way out in Hong Kong,  they're sold out online with both models of the iPhone 10 currently  unavailable.  That's in that country.  The phone apparently also sold out  on Apple's Web site over in the U.K.  Now this news coming on weak sales of  the iPhone 8 by the way, two research firms saying the 8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  Shares of Apple trading  higher in the premarket higher by more than one percent.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco, Kiko  Alonso nails it, knocks off Flacco's helmet.  And then huge fight ensues  after the hit.  Alonso was given the unnecessary roughest penalty, Alonso  crushing Flacco as he goes for the (INAUDIBLE) Flacco would go straight  into the locker room with a concussion and he would not return to the game.</p><p>Well, let's stay with some football here.  Tom Brady has got a pretty cool  new ride, Aston-Martin selling a special Tom Brady signature edition car.   The luxury convertible for $360,000.  The British sports car usually  associated with 007, it's now going T.V. 12.  Brady's signature is on the  door, on the plates, on the doors, on the T.V. 12 logo.  It's all over the  vehicle basically.  It's on the fender, it's on the headrest.  But if you  want one, keep in mind there's only 12 of these being made.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has launched the zombie  Frappuccino, the drink apparently inspired by an apple dips and caramel,  taste like a tart green apple we are told.  We're going to find out just a  second in our taste tester on set.  Starbucks hoping the drink is going to  -- well, catch on like the uniform Frappuccino which was a huge hit back in  April for the company.  Starbucks, the stock anyway is down about one  percent in the premarket right now.  Stock to watch.  So let's go with  these. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's the verdict?  OK.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I do think it taste like a tart green apple with caramel.  It  really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes.  It's a lot of ones.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ELMORE:  -- together and put in a blender and eat it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheryl, technically if it's a zombie Frappuccino, wouldn't it  taste like rotting flesh?</p><p>CASONE:  No.  Well, you know, you would think so, Dagen, but I don't think  that's what they're going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>KELLY:  You also like to know what rotting flesh tastes like, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p>CASONE:  The pink whipped cream is supposed to be the brains, OK?  The red  mocha drizzle is blood obviously.  It might gross you out. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  No, but, you know, by the way, you have to like kind of drink them  quick, because once they kind of -- the mixed up basically they're saying  like you -- once you order these, like don't like hold on to it because it  -- and then it gets kind of funky color.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Slurpy same thing happens. </p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.  Slurpy, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, paving the way for a public debut.  Maria, sitting  down with a top name from SoftBank to top about the timeline for a possible  Uber IPO. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you, ESPN reporting that Alibaba co- founder Joseph Tsai has reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49  percent minority stake The Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets worth $1.8 billion by  the latest valuation according to Forbes Magazine.  So, the Nets --</p><p>KELLY:  That's the Chinese and the Russians together now owning the Nets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I still not go to games.  Where can you find value in this  market?  Maria Bartiromo sat down with SoftBank investment adviser Rajeev  Misra in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where she asked him just that.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  You are $100-billion vision fund is dominating  conversations across the world, congratulations -- </p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISE, SOFTBANK:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the performance as well.  Tell us how you're allocating  capital.  Where are the growth opportunities in the world today? </p><p>MISRA:  Group opportunities are everywhere but it's concentrated with  entrepreneurial equal system exist and that's primarily in two locations,  China and U.S. If you look at our fund and we have two pools of capital in  SoftBank.  The vision fund which a hundred billion, plus SoftBank group  itself which makes a lot of technology and investment off this balance  sheet.  We own -- we bought the ARM last year, we have Sprint, and SoftBank  Mobile, we have 28 percent stake in Alibaba that also has grown in value  and so there are two pools of capital.  But almost half our investments are  going into U.S. 50 odd billion, a lot chunk will be in China where there's  a large population-based and there they are leapfrogging technology to  include a large part of the population hence from ride-sharing companies  like Didi to bicycle-sharing that go for food delivery, et cetera, et  cetera is very exciting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you.</p><p>MISRA:  No, Uber is not looking to take 10 billion from us, they will get a  billion -- a billion and one half as primary investment.  There is  potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity to shareholders and  employees who are early investors to sell secondary shares to SoftBank and  we are late-stage discussions to potentially buy some secondary shares from  early investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the valuations, is it harder today to find  value which is also a growth story?  I mean, obviously, Alibaba has been an  incredible performer for you, but when you look elsewhere, is there another  Alibaba out there?  </p><p>MISRA:  There may not be Alibaba but we make a thousand times in return but  we vested Nvidia nine months ago, we bought five percent of Nvidia for --  close to $3 billion, it's worth six billion in nine months.  So you don't  have to find just Alibaba to make good investments.  We are going through a  technology revolution as we speak in every aspect of human life, from food  delivery to life sciences to as I said insurance, to selling used cars, to  selling homes, to buy -- getting a mortgage, to so far getting us to loan,  every aspect of life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everything is the sharing economy.  </p><p>MISRA:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right? </p><p>MISRA:  So there is plenty of opportunities.  Valuation is not an issue if  you find the right companies that are market leaders, that have the right  entrepreneur and management, to scale, to go global, this is what SoftBank  helps with and we are a consumer company too.  We have 35 million  subscribers with Sprint, with 35 million subscribers in SoftBank Mobile in  Japan, et cetera.  And getting these companies to work with each other,  learning from each other, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  A ride- sharing companies in India Ola learns a lot from Didi in China from their  experiences and vice versa.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Telecom has been really critical for you.  Why is Telecom sort  of the underlying important, you know, backdrop of some of your  investments? </p><p>MISRA:  There are four factors that are shaping the technology revolution.   First, processing power, the ability to process and the cost of processing  has gone through phenomenal scale where your iPhone today can process  cheaper and faster than mainframe 15 years ago or a laptop computer 10  years ago, data, second.  Ability to collect data and able to process the  data which is driving (INAUDIBLE) in media which is called the graphic  processing unit and ability to structure large and analyze large  unstructured data pools and make sense out of it and predict outcomes and  predict consumer behavior, managing inventory and be able to analyze that  kind of data.  So data -- ability of collecting data and having access to  data is a second factor.  Processing data software to analyze it and  lastly, Telecom speed and cost of Telecom.  Look at 10 years ago, there  were no smartphones.  Smartphones came in 2007.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now can't live without them.  </p><p>MISRA:  And we can't live without them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>MISRA:  And the ability to have that kind of processing power in your car,  in your smartphone, in your house, so on.  Telecom speed is important for  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) Let me ask you about A.I. and the worry there.   People are wondering what skill set do I need to drive in this new world.   A.I. means robotics machine learning.  Are we going to have more robots  than humans?  Are they going to take human's jobs?.  </p><p>MISRA:  We already have a lot of robots, car is a robot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  True.</p><p>MISRA:  You know, a robot doesn't have to walk and speak, I mean, they're  kind of bots and robots.  A phone --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, should we be afraid of it?  </p><p>MISRA:  Not at all.  You have more -- you have robots today versus 10 years  ago.  You have all these cars that robots, your iPhone is a robot, et  cetera, et cetera.  They only would make -- enable your life a lot better.   They will provide healthcare services better, they will make your  entertainment better, you can listen to music, your wristwatch, your  tracker, but what skills the young needs to know and learn is there's so  much learn by -- you don't have to be a computer programmer to be -- to be  successful in this -- in the next generation.  You need to learn -- you  need to go to China, you need to go to India, see what -- all you need to  do is take what's successful in one part of the world and take it to  another.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Rajeev, it's great to have you on the program today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>MISRA:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The first reading on third-quarter GDP on the other  side of this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  3.0 percent, that's how fast the U.S. economy was growing, this  is the first reading on the third quarter gross domestic product, it's our  biggest measure, most important measure of how the overall U.S. economy is  doing.  The expectation was for 2-1/2 percent, they're about to get three  percent and see that nice three number in the front of GDP growth.  It is  kind of exciting if you want the U.S. to do well.  Joining us now is one of  our favorites guest of all time, MacroMavens president, Stephanie Pomboy.   Stephanie, just your initial take on this three percent reading, how is it  that we're growing at a three percent growth? </p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Wow.  Well, you know, I'm  surprised, I want to see the details in terms of the inventory contribution  versus the consumer spending because obviously what we care about is seeing  strong spending rather than just some inventory bill.  And I know that at  least the Atlanta fed and they're, therefore, had built in almost a full  percentage point contribution from inventories largely due from hurricanes  that we saw.  So that will be interesting to look at but as you know, you  know, my concern has been that there's been a broad deceleration in growth,  not that the wheels are off but that in a way it been general turning  downward this highways a little bit.  Since 2015, I've seen slowing tax  receipts, actually, treasury tax receipts are now down year and year which  is a recession reading.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>POMBOY:  So there's some things that just don't square with the strength of  the headlined numbers and I'm very interested to find out, you know, what  the details here are.  The other thing we're seeing that's a little is  disturbing kind of conflicts with the strong headline spending in GDP  numbers are the rise and the delinquencies.  So, there are couple things  out there that have me concerned and this is why I'm so anxious to see the  tax cuts come through because we need to pass this baton from monetary to  fiscal policy and get some more (INAUDIBLE) into the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think this three percent though gives Congress more --  that they think, the economy is doing OK, there is no urgency? That's my  worry.  </p><p>POMBOY:  That's the danger, exactly.  I mean, I'm -- since I'm looking at  thing like tax receipts and delinquencies and, you know, the slowing  consumer discretionary spending, I'm worried, you know, I'm sitting here  biting nails like they've got to get this done fast.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I'm glad you brought up tax receipts because I'm extremely  worried because the Fed keeps saying we haven't had inflation but they're  looking at the wrong indicators.  Look at asset inflation, it's been  unbelievable, look at health care, the price of health care has gone up  exponentially.  The price of getting a college education has gone up  significantly.  So when they're talking about the PCE and they're talking  about CPI, those are all just like, you know, areas for them to deflect.   Asset inflation they've even been worried about.  Now, do you see headwinds  coming about because now we're at -- I'm looking where recession highs for  the dollar, 10-year yields are going up.  I mean, do you see that this  could be the only two-quarter GDP for that we get that's good given the  headwinds?  </p><p>POMBOY:  Well, this is what I worry about, you know, I'm glad you talked  about the rising cost of health care intuition, housing expenses have gone  up a lot in the couple of years.  So if you strip out housing in health  care, you know, that's 40 percent of the increasing in consumer spending.   So discretionary spending as I said, you know, has been slowing and  actually, people are now relying more on credit cards and transfer payments  to, you know, cover their everyday necessities.  So I think it's a major  issue and then you've got the Fed doing Q.T. which isn't going to help in  terms of, you know, tightening credit conditions, et cetera.  So this is  why again, I come back to the urgency of really getting these tax cuts  through and getting some relief because right now, clearly the trend toward  decelerating growth notwithstanding this current GDP, the third quarter is,  you know, going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is the best six-month stretch since mid-2014 for the  economy in terms of GDP, and the commerce department said that this was  particularly interesting or strong, because of the hurricane.  We were  still able to grow at three percent for the quarter.  And this is the first  reading, it could be revised downward or upward, but, again, it was  particularly spectacular for that reason because of the weather.  </p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I think the things to watch going forward is what's  happening obviously on the consumer spending front, like you said, you  know, I think some of the data actually, the monthly data had been  surprisingly strong over that hurricane period.  We did see yesterday,  retail inventories were much weaker though when you saw auto inventories  thankfully, you know, post their largest decline since the recession and  that's sort of a silver lining of this hurricane, and you might have  provided all these producers some relief on the inventory front because  they've been dealing with very high -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, here we go.  Consumer spending gain was driven by motor  vehicles as Americans replaced cars damaged by the storms and then services  spending by contrast flow to its weakest since 2013, so that goes into your  kind of discretionary spending outside of housing and health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about inventories and --  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I'm pulling that out.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Can I ask you real quick about the  Fed and the plan to unwind balance sheets the Fed, what risk do you see in  terms of future GDP from that?  </p><p>POMBOY:  Well, I think we are credit dependent economy, you know, I always  talk about how it's the car basically, and credit is the fuel that gets it  going, and we've actually reached the point where we rely -- we're getting  worse mileage basically, we need gas in the tank go each additional GDP  mile.  So if you're to start to reduce the supply of fuel in the economy,  the credit fuel which is what the Fed is basically going to do but natural  tendency of the economy is going to be to grow with a slower rate.  And  we're already, you know, in the deceleration phase and the interesting  thing on that too is bank credits, total bank lending has already rolled  over sharply ahead of Q.T.  So, we haven't gone to see the real Fed  tightening and yet credit conditions are already starting to slow down.  So  this again, you know, just underscore why I'm really focused on the tax  cuts because, you know, we got to pass the baton from monetary to fiscal  policy, and right now, you know, it's a nail-biter.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And trading inventories added a combined 1.14 to the growth.  </p><p>POMBOY:  OK.  Yes.  It was supposed to add about .8, so that's a  substantially larger ad.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So real final sales been were one-six.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So that's not, you know, that's not from 2.9 last quarter.  That's  a pretty big slowdown.  So -- anyway, totally we'll get this tax cut.</p><p>POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) in the --</p><p>KELLY:  Real economy.</p><p>POMBOY:  In the real economy.  That would be nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stephanie, it's so good to see you always.  Because you all --  every time we talk to you, you always tell us something that we don't know  and it's just a different --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, that's my job.  I think, you know, let's focus on the stuff  these people are focused on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some people kind of tell you what you've already heard 800  times.  Not you, Stephanie Pomboy.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>POMBOY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have a great weekend.  Big oil in focus this morning as well,  Exxon and Chevron reporting earnings, both companies topping expectations.   Joining us now is price futures group senior market analyst, fox business  contributor, Mr. Phil Flynn.  Mr. Flynn, what do you see in these earnings?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  We're  putting the big back in big oil.  How about that?  I mean, these are  companies that a couple years ago were given up for dead, ExxonMobil used  to be the biggest energy company in the world, moved down to number four,  Chevron, of course, had some major problems with earnings, but what a  comeback right now, especially if you look at ExxonMobil, what an amazing  earnings quarter when you consider the fact that their entire refining  operation on Gulf Coast was under water last quarter.  </p><p>They're saying that their earnings would have been even better, you know,  four cents better if it weren't for that situation.  So we're seeing  something going on that's reflected not only in oil prices but in the GDP.   You know, sometimes this comeback in oils really reflective of what we've  been seeing in the economy and the economy that's recovering not only here  but around the globe, and that's why I'm really excited about big oil and  big earnings because that means the economy is feeling, demand for oil and  natural gas is going up, that means people are working so this is great  news for the economy today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil, great to see you as always.  Phil Flynn.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Coming up.  An electrifying performance from tech.   Stuart Varney weighing in on the huge gains from industry giants like  Amazon, Microsoft, Google.  And is the key to getting back on track going  off the rails?  Why General Electric is said to be considering an exit from  its railroad business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Titans of tech, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are they more  powerful than we thought?  Joining me now with his thoughts, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Even more powerful than we thought.  Well, yes, I  guess they are. I mean, turning in a performance like that yesterday  afternoon, those profit gains and now the stock price gains, I mean, for  those of you who are listening too what's on the radio, let me read this  out.  Amazon is $81.00 a share, Microsoft is up $5.00 a share, that's about  seven percent by the way, and Alphabet up is $43.00 per share.  Did anybody  see this coming?  I didn't.  I don't know about these analysts but I  certainly didn't, that was an absolutely blowout performance.  And it  extends the power of the American technology into whole new industries.   Why CVS is looking at Aetna, a corner drugstore with a health insurer, why?   Because Amazon is just around the corner coming on strong when may be the  delivery prescription drugs.  They are everywhere, these five technology  companies, they're just astonishing and quite frankly, Dagen, I am blown  away by it, period.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, because the decision if you're an investor, it literally  -- and we have talked about this for years.  It literally comes down to do  I want to own a piece of a great American business that's getting even big  -- bigger that is dominating a variety of fields or do I want to lend Uncle  Sam the Federal government, money for 10 years, and only get paid less than  2-1/2 percent in yield because that's really the decision if you're buying  a treasury versus a stock.  </p><p>VARNEY:  That's right.  Let's weigh this up, shall we? Do I join the  marking global economy and buy into technology stock and then my money goes  through the roof or do I lend -- as you say, lend to Uncle Sam and get me  two percent?  Which do I do?  OK.  I'm dead safe with Uncle Sam, I got it  but I'm going nowhere.  I'm taking a risk with technology, but I'm going  somewhere.  As for putting new money in now, that I'm not so sure of.  I'm  going to hold off on that, but as everybody knows, I do I own some  Microsoft and my point today is I'm not selling at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think Satya Nadella of Microsoft makes better decisions  with your money or Congress?  We already pay taxes, that's -- I know that's  a little simplistic but I always think -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VARNEY:  No, it's a loaded question.  That's what it is.  You know where  I'm coming from too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're fantastic each and every day.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart is coming up in almost exactly 15 minutes.  A reminder,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Three whole hours of  Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p>The first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter coming  in much better than expected.  Nicole Petallides on floor at the New York  Stock Exchange.  Hey, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good Friday morning, Dagen.  Yes, that's  right.  We're seeing the economy here in the U.S. in the latest quarter  grow faster than expected, at three percent rate faster than the 2.5  percent rate that was expected.  Why did that happen?  That was consumer  and also business spending that helped it along and that's why you did see  that growth there despite Harvey and Irma.  </p><p>Taking a look at Futures right now, up 17 points for the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  We'll see if we can make some records today.  Taking a  look at Merck, though, Dow component, Merck, that is to the downside this  morning, sales dropped three percent overall.  It did very well with  KEYTRUDA.  That is their U.S. long -- that's a cancer patient -- U.S.  cancer -- lung cancer and that really helped them along but not enough to  break through.  Stock down 2-1/2 percent, profit beat, they raised the  outlook but a sales miss overall.  </p><p>Then there's Colgate-Palmolive, so that was relatively flat.  Let's take a  look at that.  It did ramp up ad spending, about 20 percent ramped that up,  and that cut into the numbers.  That is down one-third of one percent.  And  good old G.E., well, G.E., of course, you know, we reported recently how  it's dropped out of the dividend portfolio for Morgan Stanley.  Well, now,  they're exiting and saying that they want to exit out of the railroad  business.  Just not seeing the demand, it is a seasonal business, it is --  is it inconsistent, and they have so many others from aviation to power,  health care, just to name some.</p><p>So, this morning, we're seeing it up one-quarter of one percent, but we did  see those new lows as to -- on 10.26 of 21.20.  We're not too far off of  that, so people are holding to this one for the long term, they've been  ultimately very disappointed, and there is talk (INAUDIBLE) outlook they  might be cutting the dividend, too.  And that's why Morgan Stanley,  ultimately, tried to pull them out of that portfolio for wealth management  because it's not really what they're looking for big picture.  </p><p>We have much more, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, coming up right after this, happy  Friday to you.  Keep it here on Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If Tesla wants to revolutionize how we drive, Zero Motorcycles  who wants to take your love of the road to the next level.  No noise, no  vibrations, but all the power and torque of the best bikes out there.  It's  electric and it's the next great American brand, completely made in the  United States.  Joining me now, is Zero Motorcycles' CEO, Sam Paschel.   Tell me about the bike, Sam, because I'm a Harley fan, that's a regular  old-fashioned and internal combustion engine.</p><p>SAM PASCHEL, ZERO MOTORCYCLES CEO:  It is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is not anything like that.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It is.  This is -- it's the most innovative motorcycle in the  world.  If you're familiar with a Harley, something like a Harley Sportster  1200.  Will have about 73 foot-pounds of torque.  That's basically how much  force is being applied to that back tire to really give you the  acceleration.  Zero Motorcycles -- the bike right in front of us has about  116 foot-pounds of torques.  So, you're getting the acceleration and  performance out of a, like a modern day superbike out of one of these  electric motorcycles.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you going after the audience that Harley Davidson goes  after?  What's your key demographic?  </p><p>PASCHEL:  The key demographics, we have three basic types of riders that  make up the majority of who we reach out to.  First, we have riders that  tend to have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  You know, the  electric motorcycle phenomenon, electric vehicles overall are still pretty  new.  In 2011, there were about 2,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States overall, four wheels, two wheels, everything else.  Flash forward it  last year, and there were about 160,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States and about 780,000 globally.  So, this phenomenon is catching on.   But within the motorcycle community, it's still relatively new.  So, the  three types of riders we generally get are riders who have a quiver of  bikes that have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  We get new riders,  people, that don't have that established connection with any one brand.   And throw a leg over a Zero and just fall in love with it.  </p><p>And three, and actually, probably the most common, we have riders who love  motorcycle riding at one point in their life, and then for one reason or  another, had a family, had kids, moved away from it, and now it's the lure  of electric and the differentiated ride that's really drawing them back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been on a Harley or eight in my days, and these bikes, they  don't have the roar and the rumble of a Harley that Harley riders and  devotees really crave.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It's true.  It's true.  If you think about riding a motorcycle,  and you've been on one, it's a -- it's an experience that uses all five  senses.  Three of those senses on an electric motorcycle are going to be  completely different than they are on a gas bike.  First, as you mentioned,  is the -- is the audio, the sound.  You're not going to have that same  rumble.  You're not going to have that same sense of sound.  You're going  to hear your surroundings a lot better.  You can hear what's going on  around you but you're not going to have that roar.</p><p>Number two, the smell and the fumes of a gas bike aren't really going to be  there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is my cologne.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Which is your cologne.  It's not mine today.  It's not mine  today.  It's the reason -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  -- I'm stepping on further way.  But third, and I think most  important is all the -- all the vibration that you tend to feel with the  gas bike, you don't feel with an electric motorcycle.  So the only thing  you're really feeling is your connection to the road and the ride.  For me  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  These are made in the United States, made in America just like  the Harley, so is that a selling point, too.</p><p>PASCHEL:  It's a huge point for our consumers.  The bikes have been  engineered from the ground up, designed and are all built in the bay area,  in Northern California.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How -- what are your sales like year-over-year, how much are  they growing?</p><p>PASCHEL:  They were growing in about a 35 percent compound annual growth  rate.  It's similar to what's happening in the E.V. space.  And two  dynamics at play, one, is a motorcycle market that tends to be a bit flat.   The second is an E.V. market that's growing rapidly.  Luckily for us, we're  tending to follow a curved of the E.V. market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about other products that you might be looking at outside  of motorcycles?</p><p>PASCHEL:  So, we have -- we have three basic business segments.  The first  is the commercial motorcycles which are for sale to consumers and  motorcycles for us --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I interviewed the founder of the company years ago when the  first bikes were rolling out.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Yes.  Neal was fantastic; he was a NASA-funded engineer at one  point, and a mountain bike and a motorcycle enthusiast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  The second segment for us is fleets and military.  It's a great  application for local police forces.  And third is this powertrain  business, where their companies that realize they're a little bit behind  the curve on electrification, we've got millions of miles underneath the  bikes, we've got 11 years of experience and they're coming to us to help  them electrify the products that they have already created. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam, good to see you.  Please come back.  </p><p>PASCHEL:  Thanks so much for having us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wish I would get on one but -- I'm not wearing my motorcycle  pants today.  Sam Paschel, thank you so much.</p><p>PASCHEL:  Thank you so much.  (INAUDIBLE) come out to California and we'll  get your leg throw over a bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, on a day like today, it's a little chilly, I'll take even  Northern California, the coldest place on the planet in the middle of July.   Thank you so much, Sam. </p><p>PASCHEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really good to see you.  Coming up, final thoughts from our  all-stars. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know why that song reminds me of Kevin Kelly but it  does.  Final thoughts right now.  Erin, to you first.</p><p>ELMORE:  I drank a whole Starbucks, it's obvious, Frappuccino, so I'm all  juiced up today.  My vote is for Trump to keep yelling as a (INAUDIBLE).   Have a happy weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin?</p><p>KELLY:  I'm going to bring -- wear my piano key necktie next time I'm out  here, and also it's important to note that CVS, only 14.5 percent of their  customers use mail order subscription through their pharmacy, Amazon is  coming for you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lea, final thoughts</p><p>GABRIELLE:  So the Congress, the budget resolution, well, that was due back  in April.  It's almost Halloween, if they get started on next year's now,  then they might get it done by Independence Day.  So I'd say, get it  moving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And here's my final thought to the people in Congress, the GOP  who are writing that house -- that tax reform bill, if you touch 401(k)  plans and make this market tank, you're going to own that, and you will  feel the wrath of President Trump for your remaining days in Congress.  A  big thanks to Erin Elmore, Kevin Kelly, and Lea Gabrielle.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  Mr. Varney starts right now with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p>Stuart, I don't know it if I'm early or late, but it's all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll take it.  I'll take it, Dagen, gratefully.  Thank you very  much indeed, Dagen.  All right.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p> The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p> Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p> Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p> That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p> In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p> And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p> Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p> And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p> All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p> KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p> By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p> But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p> The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p> That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p> This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p> The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p> So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p> What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p> Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p> So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p> Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p> But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p> I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p> And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p> So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p> Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p> As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p> So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p> Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p> So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p> So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p> I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p> They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p> We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p> And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p> A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p> But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p> So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p> Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p> In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p> Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p> Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p> Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p> But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p> KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p> I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p> ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p> ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p> ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p> ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p> And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p> And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p> KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p> They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p> Joining us now is --</p><p> SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p> What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p> This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p> So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p> Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p> 401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p> And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p> And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p> So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p> And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p> MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p> Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p> ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p> If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p> XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p> Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p> The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p> GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p> THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p> The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p> A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p> PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p> Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p> The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p> If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p> THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p> And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p> But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p> THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p> There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p> We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p> Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p> And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p> Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p> CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p> MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p> TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p> JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p> TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p> Earnings blitz -- big names including Merck, ExxonMobil, Chevron all  reporting this morning.  Merck just hitting the tape, earnings of $1.11 a  share topping estimates while revenue missing expectations.  We see a  little move up to the stocks at least right here right now.</p><p> Budget passed -- the House making the move which is the key to any hope of  tax reform -- that hoping to get done this year.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross praising the passage.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think the vote today told  you that they didn't put any amendments at all.  They took it exactly as it  came from the Senate even though they had been talking about quite a few  amendments.</p><p> The only reason they would have had to doing that is to grease the skids  for the tax cuts.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting a deal done ahead.</p><p> Futures are showing gains across the board, certainly lifted by some  terrific numbers out of Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet and Amazon  yesterday evening.  Those three stocks in one hour late yesterday adding  about $80 billion in market value.  So we have gains across the board.</p><p> Later this morning, we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing last quarter.  The first reading -- could we get close to 3  percent?  Maybe.</p><p> In Europe, we have gains as well -- buying in England, France and Germany  to wrap up this week.  And it was the same story overnight.</p><p> Stocks ending the week higher in Asia -- Shanghai, Japan, Hong Kong and  South Korea.  </p><p> New details behind the JFK assassination -- the White House allowing the  release of thousands of previously blocked records.

Good to see you.  Good to see you, my man.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Loving it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're trying to rock out -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Rocking out on this Friday morning.  I mean especially with  technology killing it.  I mean think about this.  As your sales up 90  percent for Microsoft, Microsoft Office 365 -- revenues up 42 percent.   Technology is 23 percent of the overall markets so it's going to lead --  it's led it higher during the year.  It's going to lead it higher going  into the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amen, Mr. Kelly.  Amen.  Coming up this morning New York Stock  Exchange President Tom Farley talks to Maria; Softbank investment adviser  CEO Rajeev Misra; and Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel; actor and director  Kevin Sorbo along with his wife Sam Sorbo.  You don't want to miss any of  those guests.</p><p> To our top story this hour however -- investors looking to earnings this  morning.  Colgate reporting just moments ago.  Earnings per share in line  with estimates at 73 cents; revenue beating expectations at $3.94 billion.   Investors also waiting on the first reading on how fast the economy was  growing last quarter.</p><p> This following the passage of the House budget vote yesterday, a key step  in paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> Joining us now, global economics editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Jon  Hilsenrath.  Jon -- what do you want to start with because earnings are -- </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How about  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- coming in better than expected but again -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- do, does Wall Street -- do investors need that tax reform to  really keep pushing stocks higher here?  Well, I mean I think they're going  to get some kind of tax reform.  We had -- the House passed the budget  yesterday.  That's another step towards completion.</p><p> They have a very aggressive timetable they are setting out in the House to  have a bill done by Thanksgiving.  I mean it's very ambitious but it looks  like they're moving in that direction.</p><p> I think really that's just whipped cream on top of the sundae at this point  because the earnings numbers are so good.  And as you said in your lead up,  you know, we're going to be getting economic growth numbers out tomorrow  and I think they're going to come in pretty strong as well.  We're looking  for something a little bit south of 3 percent; that's after 3.1 percent in  the second quarter.</p><p> The economy is doing pretty well right now.  It isn't gangbusters but it  sure is enough to keep the stock market going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What's keeping it going?  Despite -- other than regulatory  reform out of the Trump administration, despite not move by Congress to  really tackle some major issues for the economy namely Obamacare and tax  cuts, tax reform.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, sometimes I think we put too much emphasis on  what's going on in Washington when things are going poorly and when things  are going well.</p><p> Right now, it's the whole world.  What we have is a very unusual  synchronized global upturn.  The European economy has just -- has started  turning up again after spending most of the last decade in a funk.</p><p> The Japanese economy is turning up too -- up again.  You know, we talk to  people there who say their equipment sales are rising because they're  selling more into the United States.</p><p> Emerging markets are picking up.  We have really a sweet spot in the global  economy and big multinational American companies like the tech guys who  reported yesterday are benefiting from it.</p><p> KELLY:  Jon -- are you concerned about the dollar though and the strength  of it?  And should we get higher interest rates going forward?  I mean  you've seen the 10-year tick up.  It's Kevin, by the way.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Are you worried about this global story that you are talking about.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think in a moment like this when the dollar  is strong you have to say -- you have to ask why is it strong?  You know,  why is it picking up?</p><p> We have the dollar picking up because the U.S. economy is in good shape and  because earnings for American companies are there.  So that's good news.   You know, does that, you know, maybe tone down the benefits to the export  sector, yes a little bit.</p><p> But when the global economy is doing well our exporters are going to do  well, too.  So I don't think a strong dollar is a sign of weakness in a  moment like this.  I think it's a sign of strength.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, I want to move on to the Federal Reserve.  I make a list  every morning of things that I think are important to talk about.  And I  made a list and it was earnings and it was the Federal Reserve chief.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump is looking to choose a new Fed chair potentially  when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.  Fox Business' Lou Dobbs sat  down with the President to discuss the candidates.  Watch this and I want  your reaction.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do you have a preference,  out of curiosity.</p><p> LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST:  I do and -- </p><p> TRUMP:  Tell me who your preference is.  I only want that from people I  respect.</p><p> DOBBS:  I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I'll tell you what.  She was in my office three days ago.  She's  very impressive.  I like her a lot.</p><p> In one way I have to say you like to make your own mark.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> TRUMP:  You understand that.</p><p> DOBBS:  Absolutely.</p><p> TRUMP:  You like to make your own mark which is maybe one of the things  she's got a little bit against her.  But I think she's terrific.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon -- you've covered the Federal Reserve for years.  You were  the man on the fed that everybody had to listen to.  What do you think?  Do  you have any sense of who the new Fed chief will be?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we spend so much time in the office right now  trying to figure out what's going on inside of Donald Trump's head.</p><p> You know, when you look at clips like when I hear it, I wasn't looking at  it, but when I hear it he sounds like he is very impressed with Janet  Yellen.  And you've got to ask yourself, why would he change horses in the  middle of the race that he's winning right now when growth is picking up,  unemployment is down, stock prices are at record highs.</p><p> But at the same time is he said in that clip with Lou, you know, there  seems to be some desire in the President's head and also inside the White  House to put his own mark on the place, to find his own person.</p><p> So I think -- I think he is really struggling -- not struggling but I think  he is really thinking carefully through this choice and through the pros  and cons of whether to keep her or whether to let her go.  He certainly -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Jon -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- is giving her a close look.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The conventional wisdom is if John Taylor is the next of Fed  chief that he's going to be more aggressive at raising interest rates. </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump is a real estate guy.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anybody in real estate doesn't really like higher interest  rates.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  No.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's very fixated on the performance of the stock market.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is one reason why I think we've been hammering possible  changes to 401(k) plans.  That's why it resonated with him. He's like why  are you going to mess with something that could cause the market to tank?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> And that brings you back to Janet Yellen.  So -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  The compromise candidate for him is Jay Powell, a governor at  the Fed right now who's basically been right at Janet Yellen's side with  every decision that she's made, you know.</p><p> So you've got to -- you've got to believe that if he picks Jay Powell, he's  getting a Republican.  He's also getting someone who is going to keep  interest rates relatively low.  But then that bring you back to the  question of well, if he's going to bring someone's who's going to look like  Janet Yellen in the policies that he pursues why not just bring back Janet  Yellen?</p><p> You know, we're going to know within the next week.  They say he's going to  make a decision before he leaves for Asia next week.  So we can stop having  this conversation and start talking about whether he made a good decision  or a bad decision.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon -- good to see you as always.  Jon Hilsenrath -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Sure thing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- I love how you said that like you're sitting in the \"Wall  Street Journal\" Washington bureau talking about what's in President Trump's  head.  Don't we all?</p><p> Actually, you know what -- usually -- thank you Jon.  Thinking of that we  don't really need to guess because he will tell -- President Trump will  tell you what's in his head.</p><p> And he just tweeted.  \"Wacky and totally unhinged Tom Steyer who has been  fighting me and my make America great again agenda from the beginning never  wins elections.\"</p><p> For background Steyer is a billionaire who is spending $10 million on a  national ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.  There you  have it.</p><p> More from the President I'm sure on Twitter and we'll bring you that as  soon as it happens.</p><p> Still ahead shedding new light on the shot heard around the world.   Declassified after decades -- we'll delve deeper into the newly released  files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p><p> Plus rolling back prices and rolling out robots -- how Wal-Mart is using  futuristic new technology to keep shelves stocked at dozens of stores  across the country.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news President Trump just tweeting, \"Congratulations to  Speaker Ryan, GOP leader, Steve Scalise and to the Republican Party on  budget passage yesterday.  Now the biggest tax cuts.\"</p><p> I love how he refers to it as tax cuts now.</p><p> The truth coming out -- numerous JFK assassination files have been  released.</p><p> Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest details -- Kevin.</p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there -- Dagen.  Good morning to  you.  A Red Bull morning here in the nation's capital when you think about  it the 2,800 documents released last night.  These are previously redacted  and classified documents.  And I apologize for all the noise as the leaf  blower goes by here a few times every morning right around the time I talk  to you.</p><p> But let me tell you what happened last night and this is actually a pretty  important story.  It's about the documents related to the assassination of  President Kennedy.</p><p> I think the real headline though would be the fact that many of the records  were withheld due to national security concerns, according to a memo from  the President.</p><p> Now, do keep this in mind.  Those documents contain raw intelligence.   That's uncorroborated and that's likely going to speculate -- or rather  fuel more speculation about the plot to kill the President.  We do learn a  lot about the frustration of FBI chief Herbert Hoover at Cuba's possible  role as well.</p><p> Let me share just a bit of a White House statement.  They talk about those  records that were not released overnight -- 2,800 documents.  Some people  would say it's just a drop in the bucket.  The remaining records will be  released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming  weeks.</p><p> The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from agencies,  directed them to minimize redactions without delay.  And this is an  important one from the CIA -- every single one of the approximately 18,000  remaining CIA records in the collection will ultimately be released with no  document withheld in full.  That is great.  That's a boon if you're a  researcher in particular. </p><p> Now that promise could shed more light about Lee Harvey Oswald, his trips  to Mexico before the assassination and, of course, the Castro regime  including U.S. efforts, by the way, to topple the communist dictator.</p><p> There are a number of days that we are keeping an eye on, Dagen, as we look  forward to the rolling release of these documents.  I want to point your  attention to April 26, 2018.  That's when we expect another big batch.  In  the meantime -- researchers rock on and see what you can find out.</p><p> Back to you with my friend in that bloody leaf blower -- got to love this  guy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Leaf blowers are as frightening as chainsaws and louder.  Kevin  -- you did a great job.  It's great to see you.</p><p> Kevin Corke at the White House.</p><p> Still ahead -- courting Aramco -- the president of the New York Stock  Exchange sitting down with Maria at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia to talk about what they're doing to land potentially the  biggest initial public offering of all-time.</p><p> Then Instagram getting up close and personal -- the dramatic new feature  coming to the social media app.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia our own Maria  Bartiromo was able to sit down with New York Stock Exchange president Tom  Farley and get his take on everything from the Trump effect on the market  to the magnitude of the expected Saudi Aramco IPO.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  And joining me right now is the president of  the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE president Tom Farley.  Tom -- it's good  to see you.</p><p> TOM FARLEY, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's great to be back with  you -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> FARLEY:  -- in this beautiful hall.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The hall in Saudi Arabia.  It's really incredible to me how  many people in investment management, business people are here in Saudi  this week.</p><p> FARLEY:  Yes.  I mean I was just waiting to sit down with you and impromptu  was able to have a conversation with Secretary Mnuchin, Steve Schwarzman,  Howard Marks.  And it is the great and the good of financing and finance  all around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, one of the big reasons obviously is this Saudi  Aramco deal.  They are going to take their state oil company public --  could be the biggest IPO ever.  It could be up to $75 billion.</p><p> You have Alibaba which is what -- a $24 billion deal.  This would be a huge  piece of business for the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> FARLEY:  So, you know, people see me in the halls here as the head of the  New York Stock Exchange.  Everyone assumes that my relationship is totally  about the Aramco IPO.  I've actually known the -- from the minister level  to the company Saudi Aramco -- I've known the company for many years long  before the IPO was even a notion because as you know the New York Stock  Exchange is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the largest energy exchange  in the world.  I'm one of the managers of that business and Saudi Aramco is  a partner and a customer in that respect.</p><p> Regarding the IPO, we will compete for any IPO of a great global business.   I can't say too much about Saudi Aramco in particular other than anyone you  meet from the company or the ministry -- and I know you've met several of  them just this week.  They are professional.  They are sophisticated.  And  no surprise, they are carrying out a very disciplined, due diligence  process to make the right decision for Saudi Arabia as a whole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think you're going to get the deal.</p><p> FARLEY:  I'm not going to comment in particular because I don't want to  prejudice any decision that they make.  But for any great global IPO, look,  first of all we want them to make the right decision for them.  We won't  try to corner them in to make something we think is a wrong decision.</p><p> Clearly the New York Stock Exchange is the leading exchange in the world  for listings.  We have something like $34 trillion of market caps.  The  next closest exchange is a tiny, tiny fraction of that.</p><p> And so in terms of the deepest liquidity in the world that's in the United  States.  Brand name -- you get that from the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  also a rigorous governance test to be listed in the New York Stock  Exchange.  So if you list there, you're holding yourself out to be a very  well-run, well-governed company.</p><p> That is kind of the decision criteria that benefits what the New York Stock  Exchange brings.  But I have no doubt other exchanges around the world have  their own unique benefits as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are the implications of such a huge deal?  I mean if  you're looking at Alibaba being the biggest deal at $24 billion and this  deal is as high as $75 billion, give us a sense.  Give our viewers a sense  of why this is so important and what the global implications are for a  company this size to go public or to sell 5 percent of it to the public?</p><p> FARLEY:  So large IPOs are nerve-racking.  We do them a lot.  Of the top 20  IPOs of all time, I think the number is 13 have been on the New York Stock  Exchange.  And even those companies that fall on the other seven many of  them have ultimately listed in the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> We know a lot about big deals and the New York Stock Exchange is purpose- built for those big deals.  We combine humans and technology but we still  spend a lot of time getting ready for those IPOs because there is a lot of  bids and offers that come in that.  There's a lot of complexity on that  moment the stock opens.  And you need to make sure that stock opens  smoothly so that the management team of the IPO doesn't spend the next six  months or two years explaining what went wrong on IPO day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you what you're seeing right now at the New York  Stock Exchange in terms of listings.  Obviously there has always been a  massive competition between NYSE and Nasdaq.  What can you tell us in terms  of business year-to-date?</p><p> FARLEY:  Well, apropos of our interview location halfway around the world  from our normal home base, our shared home base it's a very global story.   The IPO market is booming in the U.S. and at the New York Stock Exchange.   We've had twice as many roundabouts, twice as many IPOs as all of last  year.  We've had this year twice as much in terms of dollar value and from  all around the world.</p><p> Last week alone we had a great company from Southeast Asia and we had  another company from China.  This week we have an Argentinian company, next  week a Brazilian company.  And so we are seeing great global companies  choosing the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you seeing more global companies relative to the U.S.?   Because the truth is there are a lot of start-ups who are saying, you know  what, I don't want to go public.  The regulatory environment is too tight.   And I'm not going to.</p><p> So that's why there was a problem.  People were wondering why the IPO  market was not so busy earlier this year.  The start-ups were not going  public.  </p><p> FARLEY:  I'm glad you asked that.  You know, the American audience likes to  make a big deal out of a story.  There are not as many American tech  companies going public.  And that's true.  Some of the great American tech  companies have chosen to stay private.</p><p> The last week alone, we had a young man who started a company three years  ago to provide a technology that allows for consumer lending in China --  that company is now worth over $10 billion.  It's an amazing tech story.   And the Friday company, too was a technology company that offers gaming, e- commerce and payments from Singapore.  We just don't talk about it as much  frankly because it's not American.</p><p> But these are great tech companies choosing to go public, choosing the New  York Stock Exchange fortunately.  I'm appreciative that they did choose the  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, here is a stat for you -- listed public companies in the  U.S. down 50 percent over 20 years because of the regulatory environment.   I mean the President has said he is calling for IPOs, the bar for IPOs to  be lowered.  </p><p> The Treasury came out with a report. They're basically saying the  regulatory environment is way too hard for companies to go public.</p><p> What are you doing in terms of lowering the bar, in terms of lowering the  standards, making it easier for companies to go public?</p><p> FARLEY:  You know, I think you are referring to our press report that came  out.  And if you work your way down that press report the next paragraph  starts with some of the efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and I  personally have engaged in, to push the administration to make it easier to  engage in IPOs.</p><p> You mentioned the number of public companies.  It is down by about half.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  But the average market cap is up by over three times -- The  aggregate market cap.  So the average company is five or six times bigger.   The public market works great for big companies.  It's not working as well  for small companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p> FARLEY:  And we need to acknowledge that because small companies are the  life blood of free enterprise.  They give the inspiration to even smaller  companies.  They create jobs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what can you do?  What can you do to get more small  companies to go public then?</p><p> FARLEY:  Simple things.  The pendulum has swung too far on regulation with  Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Big companies can handle it.  Small  companies can't.  So if you can allow the small companies during the IPO  process to meet more with investors and analysts, you can reduce the  Sarbanes-Oxley requirements on small companies.</p><p> Like for example, not require an external audit for the first few years  that a company is public.  And you could extend that to all new companies  not just the tiniest ones but expand the envelope a little bit and have it  be for all new companies that are new to public market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean one thing is create a longer window of time in  which companies can be in the emerging growth category.</p><p> FARLEY:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  Exactly.  And what that emerging market growth category does is it  just requires less regulation for small companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FARLEY:  You know, regulation is like taxes.  No regulation isn't the  answer and complete government control isn't the answer -- somewhere in  between is the right answer, and the pendulum is going to swing.  We have  swung too far towards heavily regulating small companies and we need to  swing it back aggressively to make sure that that IPO engine is there for  those young entrepreneurs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What does the sentiment feel like to you when you go down on  the floor, when you speak to big investors?  Because how do you like the  way the President is constantly tweeting that market has gained $5.3  trillion in market value since Election Day?  We are at record highs --  23000 and counting.</p><p> Do you feel like things are getting overheated?  Do you feel the same  sentiment when you talk to investors that you did a year ago?</p><p> FARLEY:  I walk in on the floor and I look up at the indices every morning  and it's amazing what has happened since November.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Don't you think?</p><p> FARLEY:  We're 17400 that night, if you remember because the indices really  cratered and now they had zipped back up.  However I will note, it's also a  global story.  This isn't just America.  In the last two weeks alone the  DAX, the CAC, the (INAUDIBLE) -- they have all hit all-time highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> FARLEY:  So there is a really -- this is a really good moment globally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So do you feel like sentiment is still there?  The bullishness  or are people getting worried that things are getting over priced?</p><p> FARLEY:  People are bullish.  That doesn't mean there won't be a pullback  but people are bullish without question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Tom -- it's great to see  you.</p><p> FARLEY:  Great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> FARLEY:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tom Farley is the president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up rebuilding Puerto Rico -- 80 percent of the island is  still without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

It involves  zooming and getting in really close.</p><p> And rolling back prices and rolling out some robots.  The futuristic new  tech coming to Walmart to ensure that shelves are always stocked.</p><p> To our stop story this half hour.  The crisis in Puerto Rico.  Two house  committees and a federal watchdog are now investigating the $300 million  no-bid contract that was awarded to Whitefish Energy holdings to repair  Puerto Rico's flattened electrical grid.</p><p> Critics say Whitefish has little experience repairing electricity  infrastructure.  And alleged the company has ties to interior secretary,  Ryan Zinke.</p><p> Joining us now is the spokesman of Whitefish Energy Holdings, Ken Luce.   Ken, what do you say to these investigations?  Are they warranted?</p><p> KEN LUCE, SPOKESMAN, WHITEFISH ENERGY HOLDINGS:  No.  The investigations  are not warranted.  First off, PREPA hired a firm Whitefish Energy who has  extensive experience fixing transmission lines, especially in the  mountains, which is our assignment.  Our assignment is 100 miles of  transmission lines mostly in the mountains of Puerto Rico, which are  necessary to restore the power ultimately overtime.</p><p> The real issue congress should be asking is where are the other firms that  the core and CORE and FEMA are hiring to come to the island to help repair  the grid?  Those contracts were just let last week.  Meaning, it's another  two or three weeks before more help us to the island.  That's the  frustration in Puerto Rico is the resources are not there yet.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And part of the controversy is that  Whitefish only had two full-time employees as reported when Maria hit  Puerto Rico on September 20th and then since hired all these employees.</p><p> You have a pretty robust experience in PR.  When did the company hire you?</p><p> LUCE:  The company hired us two ago.  But again, the point here is the  entire industry ramps up when you get contracts.  Whitefish has experience  in the mountains which is why we were hired.</p><p> If you have a question about that, and the business practice of ramping up  much like homebuilders, consulting firms and others do, look at the results  to date.  320 people are already on the island, lineman and engineers,  repairing the grid.  So if there's a question, then look at the facts.</p><p> My real issue is no one has asked the questions and then reported the  facts.  There's just this jump to say nothing's being done which is  inaccurate.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  What are the facts that you think aren't being reported?</p><p> LUCE:  Well, I mean, the fact you have two employees and you have a  business model that ramps up just like hundreds of firms in the United  States and all over the world.  And you now have 320 employees.</p><p> So if you question a two-person firm with the ability, look at their  experience which is working in mountainous regions and the CEO is leading  that effort in Puerto Rico today and we have 320 people on the ground in  less than three weeks.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Ken.  Erin Elmore here.   There were also allegations -- </p><p> LUCE:  Hi.</p><p> ELMORE:  Hi.  How are you?  There were also allegations that interior  secretary, Ryan Zinke's son had an internship at Whitefish.  What do you  say about that?  And is there any correlations there that are troubling?</p><p> LUCE:  No.  He did.  He was a flagger.  So he directed traffic on a summer  job through a friend.  But to say the interior secretary had anything to do  with the contract, number one, it's not true.  Everyone has said so.  He  found out about the contract after it was let.  And he also has no  authority over FEMA, the CORE, PREPA, so again there's a jump today to  guilt versus facts.</p><p> And then the other part of that is, if you really look at the political  landscape in Puerto Rico, an interior secretary and the current  administration would not necessarily be popular in Puerto Rico where the  majority of the population supported the other party.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Jen, these investigations aren't going away or at least  inquiries, two health committees, a federal watchdog investigating the  contract, the $300 million, no bid contract.  The governor of Puerto Rico  Rossello, says his administration will soon audit the contract awarded to  Whitefish.  And there's a retired air force colonel appointed to oversee  the reconstruction of the electoral grid following concerns over this very  contract.</p><p> So a lot of eyes on Whitefish now.</p><p> LUCE:  And again, we, welcome them.  Every member of congress should have  the information that they're asking for.  And we will certainly give that  out, but the first thing is, there were no questions asked.  Everybody  jumped to a conclusion based on the \"Washington Post\" article and no one  called.  We reached out to offices before this happened and said, if you  want information, we're more than happy to give it to you.</p><p> The contract with PREPA was done correctly.  PREPA has a company working on  the island and the current administration does not had those resources  there yet.  We welcome it and at the end, I'm just hoping people report  that there was nothing there.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, the director of Puerto Rico's power company has been  quoted saying that part of the reason that Whitefish was selected as the  only company that didn't require a down payment.</p><p> So I wanted to ask.  This does require a lot of money.  So, how well and  how was -- hos is Whitefish finance for this?</p><p> LUCE:  Well, Whitefish is very well capitalized.  They had financing from  several private equity firms.  They have met all their obligations to date.</p><p> But let me go back.  There was a very small deposit.  It was $2 million, I  believe.  There were another firm that also wanted to work, but required 10  to 15 times that amount to begin to work.</p><p> So capitalization isn't an issue.  We have 300 people working on the  island.  We have barges coming over every day.  We're trying to get our  equipment through the ports so that more men and women can come to work and  help Puerto Rico.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ken, thank you so much for being here.  Ken Luce, representing  Whitefish.</p><p> LUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  We'll see you soon.</p><p>Walmart bots roll out.

It was only -- all these  documents are only going to make people lose their minds.</p><p> Meantime, the FBI is set to give congress documents related to the  controversial Russian dossier that we now know the democrats and the in the  Hillary Clinton were behind.  Cheryl Casone has that story.  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  About that right, Dagen?  House Speaker, Paul Ryan says the  FBI has agreed to provide documents long stopped by congress in a variety  of investigations including information about a 35-page research document  containing unverified allegations about President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAUL RYAN, U.S. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The FBI got in  touch with us yesterday afternoon and they has -- they have informed us  that they will comply with our document requests and that they will provide  the documents congress has been asking for by next week and we expect the  FBI to honor that commitment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that both Clinton campaign chairman  John Podesta and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denied to  congressional investigators that they had any knowledge about who paid for  the dossier.  That testimony could put them in hot water, as it came a week  before it was revealed that in fact democrats had paid for part of it.</p><p> Podesta and Schultz could face perjury charges if it turns out they gave  false statements to congress.</p><p> OK.

Cleveland Police say they saw the boy's car speed by, chased by another car  possibly driven his mother.</p><p> The 15-mile chase lasted less than an hour.  It finally ended after a  trooper was able to nudge the car into that sign, as you can see here with  his cruiser.  The kid was boxed in.  The kid was taken into custody.   Police say this same little boy stole his mother's Dodge Charger for a spin  and went down Interstate 90 earlier this month.  Yes, all right.</p><p>Instagram, introducing a new feature called Super Zoom.  Users can create  dramatic zoom and shots and you can set it to music.

And those are your speedy headlines.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's insane.  And I think we should point out it's just  a miracle that nobody was hurt whether, it's the kid or a passenger in  another car, a driver in another car.  I want to point that out.</p><p> But in terms of this Instagram feature, Erin just changed my life when she  told me about this.  An app.  It's called YouCam Perfect.  It basically  edits your face.

I'm sure the person who meets up with you feel that  way too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  At the cancer center with my mother where I never wear any  makeup.  People see me now they're going to go, you look familiar but you  look like the older sister of somebody on television.  I'm like, OK,  thanks.</p><p> If only there's a filter we could walk around with an everyday life.  You  hand it to people.</p><p> Still ahead, let there be light.  Actor and director, Kevin Sorbo joining  us with his wife Sam Sorbo, to talk about their new movie shining a light  on the crisis of faith.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hollywood sexual harassment secrets revealed.  Our next guests,  \"Hercules\" actor, Kevin Sorbo, says he too was a victim.  Joining us now is  Kevin and his actress wife, Sam.  They're here to talk about their new  movie.</p><p> But, first, I wanted to talk about -- because you have come out and said  that you -- that Gianni Versace hit on him.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO, AMERICAN ACTOR:  In my book and it happened years ago.  It's  already in my book.  It's not like a secret.  I didn't suffer any trauma  from it but I'm not taking with the people who have, because it's out  there.  Look at them.  I'm a big dude.  Most people in Hollywood aren't  going to -- they're not going to kid on me.  They're afraid of me.</p><p> The most male actors are five-eight.  I'm a big guy.</p><p> SAM SORBO, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  What's amazing is to see now this sorted --  the sorted underbelly of Hollywood coming out.  And we have a film that's  coming out tonight and it's almost the antisepsis of that, right?  Produced  outside of Hollywood with Sean Hannity, as you know.  Not funded by  Hollywood at all.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fox News Channel, so he -- we have to disclose that.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  He's on the Fox News Channel.  No, it's true and so we're kind  of excited that -- because this film takes a different one.  This is the --  this is the film that Hollywood used to produce.  The uplifting film.  The  film with Godly character.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Prior to the '60s, Hollywood produced, character-driven  movies.  And now, it's changed.  They celebrate antihero.  They celebrate  sort of the negativity in life.  It's just weird to me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't think it's a stretch to say this that with Hollywood and  people in that industry broadly speaking that there's a disconnect between  individual and family and faith.</p><p> And that that -- it is largely an industry that is if they don't -- faith  is not front and center if people go to church regularly.  And so, do you  think that that opened the door for greater sexual harassment over decades?   And I'm not naming any individual.  But it's a lack connection to God and  higher power.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  It's actually -- it's a different face.  OK.  If you think of  it as a non-faith -- </p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Every movie is faith-based movie.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  Their face is different.  They put faith in Darwinism and  evolution and survival of the fittest, which is what Harvey Weinstein did.   Survival of the fittest.  He took what he wanted and he got it.  And  sometimes they made him pay for it and he was cool with that.  And it was  business as usual and everybody who knew about it was perfectly fine with  it.  It's a completely different face.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You worship at the altar of filth.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Yes.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  And so in our movie, we juxtapose the two, right?  We have two  people who are grieving and one of them worships at the altar of self.   He's basically an egomaniac.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  That's my character.  Yes, he's not a very good guy.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  And his ex-wife.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  But he's a lost man.  He's lost.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  He's lost.  And an ex-wife who is faithful and goes to church  and is raising their two boys in the Christian faith.  And so we juxtapose  the two.  And you can walk it alone or you can walk it with higher power  and you see the difference.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to watch this clip:  \"Let There Be Light.\"  Opens  nationwide today.  Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAM SORBO:  What do you think it does to the boys to take the death of  their brother and using his part of your carnival act?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  It pays the bills.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Daddy.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clinically dead in entrance for four minutes.  It's a  miracle.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's incredible.  And you wrote it, Sam.  You co-wrote the  script.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  I co-wrote it with Dan Gordon who's a very well-known Hollywood  screenwriter and I was -- I was lucky that he jumped right on board when he  heard the idea.  And then two weeks later, out of the blue Sean calls Kevin  and says.</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Sean gave me a call and says, hey, I want to do movie with  you.  I love your got -- what soul-searching movie.  And I said, we got  one.  And we included in the arc and boom.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm going to put you on the spot.  Is this your favorite project  you've ever worked on?  Especially you work with your wife and she co-wrote  it?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Well, there's questions, one of my favorite ones.  It's in  the top five.  I've done between Hercules and a drama and then -- and then  54 movies.  I've done a lot of work.</p><p> I mean, but I'm very fortunate that I'm still working, because certainly  coming out of the conservative Christian closet in Hollywood for an  industry this of tolerance and freedom of speech, it's pretty much a one- way street with them.  So I've been very lucky to keep working.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  People can go to lettherebelightmovie.com.  They can find out  what theaters it's playing.  And if it's not playing in the theater near  you, I urge people to go, call the theaters or go to the website and  organize group tickets.</p><p> We found that there's a little bit of a threshold, higher thresholds for  faith-based films being booked into theaters.  If they're looking for some  sort of proof, some sort of presales and stuff, that they don't typically  look for in non-faith movies -- </p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Well, that's kind of typical for small independent movies.   It really is that way, if you don't have a big budget to promote.</p><p> SAM SORBO:  The idea with movies is, movies are storytelling.  They shape  the culture.  Hollywood shapes our culture.  Do we want the culture of  Hollywood to trickle down into this culture?  Do we want the culture of  Harvey Weinstein to be pervasive in the U.S. culture?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Kevin.  Are you finding though that people are more  receptive to conservative, more receptive to people who are kind of wear  their faith on the outside as a lot of people and other parts of the  Hollywood?</p><p> KEVIN SORBO:  Let me tell you something.  I travel a lot.  One to airports.   Wherever I'm on streets, cities, no matter where I am, people walk up to me  now, not because of \"Hercules\" and drama, they walk to me because of  (INAUDIBLE) please make more movies like this.</p><p> So if they want to see more movies like this, they have to support them,  because like I said, we don't have the big budget to bring these out there.   And movies like this become successful because of word-of-mouth.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sam and Kevin Sorbo and you can see -- I'm on \"Outnumbered\"  today.  I'm lucky, guys.  So I'll be very nice.  I promise.  Thank you both  so much.</p><p> Still ahead, exed out.  Apple's iPhone 10 selling out already.  Presales  started earlier today.  When can you get it and how much will you pay?   More head.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  And  it's Friday, October 27th.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Earnings extravaganza, big names including Merck, ExxonMobil,  Chevron, all reporting this morning.  This comes after stellar, earnings  yesterday afternoon from tech giants, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent  Alphabet all delivering better-than-expected results.  Amazon shares  jumping on the news, CEO Jeff Bezos made about $6 billion extra on that  move.  Not the only good news for that retailer, the company gaining  wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states.  The part of driving force  behind CVS making a deal to buy health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66  billion.</p><p> The futures are showing begins across the board this morning.  We have a  32-point gain on the Dow futures, held higher by Microsoft stock again on  those positive earnings and also Intel, two Dow components.  We have gains  across the board.  Later this hour we get the first reading on fast U.S.  economy was growing in the third quarter.  The first reading on third- quarter GDP.  Investors also eyeing key developments out of Washington  including the House passing a budget and we have Exxon earnings coming in  right now.  Looking double beat, 66.17 billion on the revenue line and then  also earnings per share coming in higher as well.  93 cents a share on  Exxon versus an estimate of 86 cents a share.  So, a double beat on Exxon  and, again, those earnings growth in the energy sector from a year ago  gangbusters, so up triple-digit gains on earnings there.</p><p> Meantime, President Trump tweeting on the matter this morning saying, I'll  be talking about the House budget.  Congratulations to Speaker Ryan, GOP  Leader Steve Scalise and Republican Party on budget passage yesterday, now  the biggest tax cuts.  Moving on to new details behind the JFK  assassination, the White House allowing the release of thousands of  previously blocked records, the staggering revelation including a possible  warning nearly 30 minutes ahead of the tragedy.  And iPhone lovers braving  their early morning hours to order the iPhone 10.  The latest as preorders  for the highly-anticipated device go up online.  And Apple needs a winner  because those iPhone 8 sales, the slowest for a new device in years.  </p><p> The greatest of all time taking the wheel, the staggering amount it will  cost you to drive a special edition Aston-Martin designed by really?   Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.  That's right.  What can the man not do?   I'm joking.  And here with me to break it all down, Fox News Correspondent  Lea Gabrielle, Kelly and Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and  Republican strategist and former Trump surrogate, Erin Elmore.  Lovely to  be with you.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  I just want to say the Aston-Martin  comes with fully inflated tires.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh, hey yow.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Get down.</p><p> KELLY:  That's right. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the wife in the -- in the passenger seat nagging.  His wife  rather.</p><p> KELLY:  Does she nag?  I haven't heard her say a word ever.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Nag.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  The one thing we didn't say is that Stephanie Pomboy is going to be  here and she is one of our favorite economists especially when it comes to  GDP and she will give coverage and read-throughs that no one else has on  the streets.  She's my favorite person when she comes in.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kevin, you see, here is how it goes every morning since she do  the short show almost like two times a week.  We introduce the panel, and  then we promo the guests.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you just stepped on my promo.</p><p> KELLY:  I know, I know.  But I'm just so excited. </p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I thought I was just sober for coming  on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So he just -- so Kevin just stepped on this promo but we do have  SoftBank investment, Rajeev Misra coming up, SoftBank adviser/CEO, Maria  talked to him yesterday.  Sam Paschel, Zero Motorcycle CEO and \"VARNEY AND  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Don't miss -- and Stephanie Pomboy at the  bottom of the hour.  But busy earning season continues with two big oil  companies reporting.  We just had Exxon earnings hitting the tape, earnings  per share of 93 cents topping expectations.  Revenue also a beat.  Kevin  Kelly, your thoughts on the energy sector because again, this is huge surge  in earnings off the bottom a year -- near the bottom a year ago.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And that highlights the effect of what's really driving the  earning season this year because the energy sector was so depressed when  you think about where oil was even a year ago.  You had 25, 30, $35.00,  $45.00 a barrel of oil.  Now we stayed now consistently above 50 but that  hasn't played through yet.  So one of the interesting aspects is we're  going to want to see what guidance is going forward.  Investors are solely  focused on the effects of the hurricanes that are going to be in Chevron as  well as the Exxon.  What they see going forward where they are in terms of  cost cuts, that's been a very, very big focus for them because a lot of  times, the cost of oil a barrel is higher for a lot of these integrated  when you're thinking Exxon, Chevron, right?  So they're in -- they're all  over the globe, and so because there has been a depression of prices  globally that's affecting them, the last thing is also what they're going  to do M&amp;A wise.  People are worried that they need to start buying  companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory backdrop because we always focus on  Washington and what the Congress hasn't done on health care and taxes but  in terms of the regulation rollback that is something the Trump  administration has been on top of and that does particularly help energy  companies.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  That really helps energy companies and they've even spoken  about that on their investor and conference call all year long.  They're  waiting for actually even more deregulation to happen in the space  especially for them to deploy more of their capital because we've seen coal  as actually done really well this year and the supplies are up and people  are using it more especially with renewable energies and a lot of tax  credits that are flowing through on there.  So a lot -- a lot of policy  coming out of Washington is going to dictate what happens to these  companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google on track  for record highs today.  Amazon stock also getting a boost; Microsoft and  Intel really pushing up the Dow futures this morning.  You look at these  stocks go and Amazon on the news that not just earnings but Amazon is  getting into the pharmacy business or it's gotten approval for wholesale  pharmacy licenses and at least dozens stays.  This comes as the Wall Street  Journal, Kevin, is reporting that giant drugstore chain CVS is in talks to  buy the third largest insurer in the country.  Aetna for $66 billion.  This  CVS deal is in direct response to Amazon, is that right?  What other kinds  of deals could we be looking at in response to Amazon's move into more and  more businesses?  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And this really is a shot across the bow because if you think  about what did Amazon do that was of the most significant recently, they  bought Whole Foods, right?  So with getting the state licenses, with  pharmacies can they start distributing -- basically prescription drugs  through their whole partnership and logistics with Whole Foods.  So you see  CVS actually now striking out and looking to do a deal with Aetna and  insurer which they have no experience in.  So this is actually pretty  telling.  We're going to see this story play out over the next couple  quarters, not years.  There is going to be a lot of activity and we're  going to get a lot of activity and we're going to get a lot of direction  that's coming through on that.  And you can see, Amazon is fighting, Wal- Mart toe-to-toe and especially when in the next leg of fight with them is  in the -- is in the prescription drug business.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is a huge business.</p><p> ELMORE:  Prices can come way down.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are some drug packages like with Medicare prescription  drug packages packages, the part D that you can only buy prescriptions at  like major pharmacy like you aren't able and allowed to go and buy -- get  prescriptions at smaller like local pharmacy.  You literally have to.   Where I'm from you have to go to Wal-Mart.  It's the only place you can go.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  And the Whole -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, again trying to break up that juggernaut.</p><p> KELLY:  And Amazon's idea behind this is the description model.  So people  don't need to continuously go to the pharmacy if they have a physical  presence and then they can get that subscription.  They'll figure out the  delivery and like I said, with their logistic systems that they do have  with Whole Foods.</p><p> ELMORE:  And the delivery is a great idea for people that are homebound or  wheelchair bound, things like that, it's also helping that market, they  really can't help themselves, so I think that's really nice for us people.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But with this CVS acquisition of Aetna in terms of what it could  potentially do expanding, basically giving a huge number of new customers  through Aetna for its pharmacy benefit management business bolstering its  leverage in negotiation for drug with drug makers in terms of pricing power  and then also you strike deals with -- to tie drug prices to patient  outcomes which is also incredible.  I want to move on to Washington, this  time, it's about truth coming out of D.C.  Numerous JFL assassination filed  released.  Blake Burman is at the White House with the very latest.  Blake,  good morning.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  And this was nearly 2900 additional documents relating to  President Kennedy and his assassination that were produce last night by the  National Archives, not all the documents though within this last batch  though were put forward as the president said in a memo that \"Certain  information should continue to be redacted because of national security,  law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.\"  These newest documents  though do shed more details about the events surrounding the assassination  of JFK.  For example, one shows that a British reporter received a phone  call about 25 minutes before President Kennedy was shot and was told that  there would be impending \"Big news.\"  </p><p> Another detail show an FBI source then claimed days later that the Soviet  Union was fearful that a missile could head their way because of the  actions of an irresponsible U.S. general.  This final batch of the last set  of documents has to be released now by the end of April.  And President  Trump tweeted out moments ago the following, he said and I quote, \"JFK  files are being carefully released.  In the end, there will be great  transparency.  It is my hope to get just about everything to the public.\"   For now, Dagen if you need good some good reading, you're just curious or  whatever it might be, all you have to do is head on over to National  Archives Web site, the documents are listed right there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm tempted, I am really tempted when I came out I was  (INAUDIBLE)I got other stuff I need to read.  So yes, weekend reading.   Thank you so much --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BURMAN:  It will be there for a while.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  Great to see you as always.   Preorders for the iPhone selling out in just minutes, overnight.  What it  means for anyone trying to get their hands on this hot device.  The release  date is technically November the 3rd but what if you need it before  Christmas or the holidays?  And nobody can drive down the field like Tom  Brady but at least you can drive down the road like the Patriots superstar.   The hot new ride from Aston-martin inspired by the greatest of all time.</p><p> KELLY:  Not.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Preorders for the Apple 10 iPhone starting today but you might  have trouble getting yours in.  Cheryl Casone has more details on this.   Hey, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Hey, Dagen.  Sources saying supplies of the hot  new phone are sold out, shipping estimates slipping well beyond the  November 3rd launch date here in the U.S. on Apple's Web site five to six  weeks right now.  According to one report by the way out in Hong Kong,  they're sold out online with both models of the iPhone 10 currently  unavailable.  That's in that country.  The phone apparently also sold out  on Apple's Web site over in the U.K.  Now this news coming on weak sales of  the iPhone 8 by the way, two research firms saying the 8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  Shares of Apple trading  higher in the premarket higher by more than one percent.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco, Kiko  Alonso nails it, knocks off Flacco's helmet.  And then huge fight ensues  after the hit.  Alonso was given the unnecessary roughest penalty, Alonso  crushing Flacco as he goes for the (INAUDIBLE) Flacco would go straight  into the locker room with a concussion and he would not return to the game.</p><p> Well, let's stay with some football here.  Tom Brady has got a pretty cool  new ride, Aston-Martin selling a special Tom Brady signature edition car.   The luxury convertible for $360,000.  The British sports car usually  associated with 007, it's now going T.V. 12.  Brady's signature is on the  door, on the plates, on the doors, on the T.V. 12 logo.  It's all over the  vehicle basically.  It's on the fender, it's on the headrest.  But if you  want one, keep in mind there's only 12 of these being made.</p><p> And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has launched the zombie  Frappuccino, the drink apparently inspired by an apple dips and caramel,  taste like a tart green apple we are told.  We're going to find out just a  second in our taste tester on set.  Starbucks hoping the drink is going to  -- well, catch on like the uniform Frappuccino which was a huge hit back in  April for the company.  Starbucks, the stock anyway is down about one  percent in the premarket right now.  Stock to watch.  So let's go with  these. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What's the verdict?  OK.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I do think it taste like a tart green apple with caramel.  It  really --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, yes.  It's a lot of ones.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ELMORE:  -- together and put in a blender and eat it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cheryl, technically if it's a zombie Frappuccino, wouldn't it  taste like rotting flesh?</p><p> CASONE:  No.  Well, you know, you would think so, Dagen, but I don't think  that's what they're going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p> KELLY:  You also like to know what rotting flesh tastes like, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p> CASONE:  The pink whipped cream is supposed to be the brains, OK?  The red  mocha drizzle is blood obviously.  It might gross you out. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CASONE:  No, but, you know, by the way, you have to like kind of drink them  quick, because once they kind of -- the mixed up basically they're saying  like you -- once you order these, like don't like hold on to it because it  -- and then it gets kind of funky color.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Slurpy same thing happens. </p><p> ELMORE:  Yes.  Slurpy, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, paving the way for a public debut.  Maria, sitting  down with a top name from SoftBank to top about the timeline for a possible  Uber IPO. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you, ESPN reporting that Alibaba co- founder Joseph Tsai has reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49  percent minority stake The Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets worth $1.8 billion by  the latest valuation according to Forbes Magazine.  So, the Nets --</p><p> KELLY:  That's the Chinese and the Russians together now owning the Nets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I still not go to games.  Where can you find value in this  market?  Maria Bartiromo sat down with SoftBank investment adviser Rajeev  Misra in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where she asked him just that.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  You are $100-billion vision fund is dominating  conversations across the world, congratulations -- </p><p> RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISE, SOFTBANK:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- on the performance as well.  Tell us how you're allocating  capital.  Where are the growth opportunities in the world today? </p><p> MISRA:  Group opportunities are everywhere but it's concentrated with  entrepreneurial equal system exist and that's primarily in two locations,  China and U.S. If you look at our fund and we have two pools of capital in  SoftBank.  The vision fund which a hundred billion, plus SoftBank group  itself which makes a lot of technology and investment off this balance  sheet.  We own -- we bought the ARM last year, we have Sprint, and SoftBank  Mobile, we have 28 percent stake in Alibaba that also has grown in value  and so there are two pools of capital.  But almost half our investments are  going into U.S. 50 odd billion, a lot chunk will be in China where there's  a large population-based and there they are leapfrogging technology to  include a large part of the population hence from ride-sharing companies  like Didi to bicycle-sharing that go for food delivery, et cetera, et  cetera is very exciting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you.</p><p> MISRA:  No, Uber is not looking to take 10 billion from us, they will get a  billion -- a billion and one half as primary investment.  There is  potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity to shareholders and  employees who are early investors to sell secondary shares to SoftBank and  we are late-stage discussions to potentially buy some secondary shares from  early investors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the valuations, is it harder today to find  value which is also a growth story?  I mean, obviously, Alibaba has been an  incredible performer for you, but when you look elsewhere, is there another  Alibaba out there?  </p><p> MISRA:  There may not be Alibaba but we make a thousand times in return but  we vested Nvidia nine months ago, we bought five percent of Nvidia for --  close to $3 billion, it's worth six billion in nine months.  So you don't  have to find just Alibaba to make good investments.  We are going through a  technology revolution as we speak in every aspect of human life, from food  delivery to life sciences to as I said insurance, to selling used cars, to  selling homes, to buy -- getting a mortgage, to so far getting us to loan,  every aspect of life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everything is the sharing economy.  </p><p> MISRA:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right? </p><p> MISRA:  So there is plenty of opportunities.  Valuation is not an issue if  you find the right companies that are market leaders, that have the right  entrepreneur and management, to scale, to go global, this is what SoftBank  helps with and we are a consumer company too.  We have 35 million  subscribers with Sprint, with 35 million subscribers in SoftBank Mobile in  Japan, et cetera.  And getting these companies to work with each other,  learning from each other, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  A ride- sharing companies in India Ola learns a lot from Didi in China from their  experiences and vice versa.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Telecom has been really critical for you.  Why is Telecom sort  of the underlying important, you know, backdrop of some of your  investments? </p><p> MISRA:  There are four factors that are shaping the technology revolution.   First, processing power, the ability to process and the cost of processing  has gone through phenomenal scale where your iPhone today can process  cheaper and faster than mainframe 15 years ago or a laptop computer 10  years ago, data, second.  Ability to collect data and able to process the  data which is driving (INAUDIBLE) in media which is called the graphic  processing unit and ability to structure large and analyze large  unstructured data pools and make sense out of it and predict outcomes and  predict consumer behavior, managing inventory and be able to analyze that  kind of data.  So data -- ability of collecting data and having access to  data is a second factor.  Processing data software to analyze it and  lastly, Telecom speed and cost of Telecom.  Look at 10 years ago, there  were no smartphones.  Smartphones came in 2007.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now can't live without them.  </p><p> MISRA:  And we can't live without them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> MISRA:  And the ability to have that kind of processing power in your car,  in your smartphone, in your house, so on.  Telecom speed is important for  that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) Let me ask you about A.I. and the worry there.   People are wondering what skill set do I need to drive in this new world.   A.I. means robotics machine learning.  Are we going to have more robots  than humans?  Are they going to take human's jobs?.  </p><p> MISRA:  We already have a lot of robots, car is a robot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  True.</p><p> MISRA:  You know, a robot doesn't have to walk and speak, I mean, they're  kind of bots and robots.  A phone --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, should we be afraid of it?  </p><p> MISRA:  Not at all.  You have more -- you have robots today versus 10 years  ago.  You have all these cars that robots, your iPhone is a robot, et  cetera, et cetera.  They only would make -- enable your life a lot better.   They will provide healthcare services better, they will make your  entertainment better, you can listen to music, your wristwatch, your  tracker, but what skills the young needs to know and learn is there's so  much learn by -- you don't have to be a computer programmer to be -- to be  successful in this -- in the next generation.  You need to learn -- you  need to go to China, you need to go to India, see what -- all you need to  do is take what's successful in one part of the world and take it to  another.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Rajeev, it's great to have you on the program today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> MISRA:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The first reading on third-quarter GDP on the other  side of this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  3.0 percent, that's how fast the U.S. economy was growing, this  is the first reading on the third quarter gross domestic product, it's our  biggest measure, most important measure of how the overall U.S. economy is  doing.  The expectation was for 2-1/2 percent, they're about to get three  percent and see that nice three number in the front of GDP growth.  It is  kind of exciting if you want the U.S. to do well.  Joining us now is one of  our favorites guest of all time, MacroMavens president, Stephanie Pomboy.   Stephanie, just your initial take on this three percent reading, how is it  that we're growing at a three percent growth? </p><p> STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Wow.  Well, you know, I'm  surprised, I want to see the details in terms of the inventory contribution  versus the consumer spending because obviously what we care about is seeing  strong spending rather than just some inventory bill.  And I know that at  least the Atlanta fed and they're, therefore, had built in almost a full  percentage point contribution from inventories largely due from hurricanes  that we saw.  So that will be interesting to look at but as you know, you  know, my concern has been that there's been a broad deceleration in growth,  not that the wheels are off but that in a way it been general turning  downward this highways a little bit.  Since 2015, I've seen slowing tax  receipts, actually, treasury tax receipts are now down year and year which  is a recession reading.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> POMBOY:  So there's some things that just don't square with the strength of  the headlined numbers and I'm very interested to find out, you know, what  the details here are.  The other thing we're seeing that's a little is  disturbing kind of conflicts with the strong headline spending in GDP  numbers are the rise and the delinquencies.  So, there are couple things  out there that have me concerned and this is why I'm so anxious to see the  tax cuts come through because we need to pass this baton from monetary to  fiscal policy and get some more (INAUDIBLE) into the economy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think this three percent though gives Congress more --  that they think, the economy is doing OK, there is no urgency? That's my  worry.  </p><p> POMBOY:  That's the danger, exactly.  I mean, I'm -- since I'm looking at  thing like tax receipts and delinquencies and, you know, the slowing  consumer discretionary spending, I'm worried, you know, I'm sitting here  biting nails like they've got to get this done fast.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, I'm glad you brought up tax receipts because I'm extremely  worried because the Fed keeps saying we haven't had inflation but they're  looking at the wrong indicators.  Look at asset inflation, it's been  unbelievable, look at health care, the price of health care has gone up  exponentially.  The price of getting a college education has gone up  significantly.  So when they're talking about the PCE and they're talking  about CPI, those are all just like, you know, areas for them to deflect.   Asset inflation they've even been worried about.  Now, do you see headwinds  coming about because now we're at -- I'm looking where recession highs for  the dollar, 10-year yields are going up.  I mean, do you see that this  could be the only two-quarter GDP for that we get that's good given the  headwinds?  </p><p> POMBOY:  Well, this is what I worry about, you know, I'm glad you talked  about the rising cost of health care intuition, housing expenses have gone  up a lot in the couple of years.  So if you strip out housing in health  care, you know, that's 40 percent of the increasing in consumer spending.   So discretionary spending as I said, you know, has been slowing and  actually, people are now relying more on credit cards and transfer payments  to, you know, cover their everyday necessities.  So I think it's a major  issue and then you've got the Fed doing Q.T. which isn't going to help in  terms of, you know, tightening credit conditions, et cetera.  So this is  why again, I come back to the urgency of really getting these tax cuts  through and getting some relief because right now, clearly the trend toward  decelerating growth notwithstanding this current GDP, the third quarter is,  you know, going to continue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is the best six-month stretch since mid-2014 for the  economy in terms of GDP, and the commerce department said that this was  particularly interesting or strong, because of the hurricane.  We were  still able to grow at three percent for the quarter.  And this is the first  reading, it could be revised downward or upward, but, again, it was  particularly spectacular for that reason because of the weather.  </p><p> POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I think the things to watch going forward is what's  happening obviously on the consumer spending front, like you said, you  know, I think some of the data actually, the monthly data had been  surprisingly strong over that hurricane period.  We did see yesterday,  retail inventories were much weaker though when you saw auto inventories  thankfully, you know, post their largest decline since the recession and  that's sort of a silver lining of this hurricane, and you might have  provided all these producers some relief on the inventory front because  they've been dealing with very high -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, here we go.  Consumer spending gain was driven by motor  vehicles as Americans replaced cars damaged by the storms and then services  spending by contrast flow to its weakest since 2013, so that goes into your  kind of discretionary spending outside of housing and health care.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about inventories and --  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I'm pulling that out.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Can I ask you real quick about the  Fed and the plan to unwind balance sheets the Fed, what risk do you see in  terms of future GDP from that?  </p><p> POMBOY:  Well, I think we are credit dependent economy, you know, I always  talk about how it's the car basically, and credit is the fuel that gets it  going, and we've actually reached the point where we rely -- we're getting  worse mileage basically, we need gas in the tank go each additional GDP  mile.  So if you're to start to reduce the supply of fuel in the economy,  the credit fuel which is what the Fed is basically going to do but natural  tendency of the economy is going to be to grow with a slower rate.  And  we're already, you know, in the deceleration phase and the interesting  thing on that too is bank credits, total bank lending has already rolled  over sharply ahead of Q.T.  So, we haven't gone to see the real Fed  tightening and yet credit conditions are already starting to slow down.  So  this again, you know, just underscore why I'm really focused on the tax  cuts because, you know, we got to pass the baton from monetary to fiscal  policy, and right now, you know, it's a nail-biter.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And trading inventories added a combined 1.14 to the growth.  </p><p> POMBOY:  OK.  Yes.  It was supposed to add about .8, so that's a  substantially larger ad.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> POMBOY:  So real final sales been were one-six.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> POMBOY:  So that's not, you know, that's not from 2.9 last quarter.  That's  a pretty big slowdown.  So -- anyway, totally we'll get this tax cut.</p><p> POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) in the --</p><p> KELLY:  Real economy.</p><p> POMBOY:  In the real economy.  That would be nice.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stephanie, it's so good to see you always.  Because you all --  every time we talk to you, you always tell us something that we don't know  and it's just a different --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> POMBOY:  Well, that's my job.  I think, you know, let's focus on the stuff  these people are focused on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Some people kind of tell you what you've already heard 800  times.  Not you, Stephanie Pomboy.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> POMBOY:  Thank you so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Have a great weekend.  Big oil in focus this morning as well,  Exxon and Chevron reporting earnings, both companies topping expectations.   Joining us now is price futures group senior market analyst, fox business  contributor, Mr. Phil Flynn.  Mr. Flynn, what do you see in these earnings?</p><p> PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  We're  putting the big back in big oil.  How about that?  I mean, these are  companies that a couple years ago were given up for dead, ExxonMobil used  to be the biggest energy company in the world, moved down to number four,  Chevron, of course, had some major problems with earnings, but what a  comeback right now, especially if you look at ExxonMobil, what an amazing  earnings quarter when you consider the fact that their entire refining  operation on Gulf Coast was under water last quarter.  </p><p> They're saying that their earnings would have been even better, you know,  four cents better if it weren't for that situation.  So we're seeing  something going on that's reflected not only in oil prices but in the GDP.   You know, sometimes this comeback in oils really reflective of what we've  been seeing in the economy and the economy that's recovering not only here  but around the globe, and that's why I'm really excited about big oil and  big earnings because that means the economy is feeling, demand for oil and  natural gas is going up, that means people are working so this is great  news for the economy today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Phil, great to see you as always.  Phil Flynn.</p><p> FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Coming up.  An electrifying performance from tech.   Stuart Varney weighing in on the huge gains from industry giants like  Amazon, Microsoft, Google.  And is the key to getting back on track going  off the rails?  Why General Electric is said to be considering an exit from  its railroad business.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Titans of tech, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are they more  powerful than we thought?  Joining me now with his thoughts, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Even more powerful than we thought.  Well, yes, I  guess they are. I mean, turning in a performance like that yesterday  afternoon, those profit gains and now the stock price gains, I mean, for  those of you who are listening too what's on the radio, let me read this  out.  Amazon is $81.00 a share, Microsoft is up $5.00 a share, that's about  seven percent by the way, and Alphabet up is $43.00 per share.  Did anybody  see this coming?  I didn't.  I don't know about these analysts but I  certainly didn't, that was an absolutely blowout performance.  And it  extends the power of the American technology into whole new industries.   Why CVS is looking at Aetna, a corner drugstore with a health insurer, why?   Because Amazon is just around the corner coming on strong when may be the  delivery prescription drugs.  They are everywhere, these five technology  companies, they're just astonishing and quite frankly, Dagen, I am blown  away by it, period.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, because the decision if you're an investor, it literally  -- and we have talked about this for years.  It literally comes down to do  I want to own a piece of a great American business that's getting even big  -- bigger that is dominating a variety of fields or do I want to lend Uncle  Sam the Federal government, money for 10 years, and only get paid less than  2-1/2 percent in yield because that's really the decision if you're buying  a treasury versus a stock.  </p><p> VARNEY:  That's right.  Let's weigh this up, shall we? Do I join the  marking global economy and buy into technology stock and then my money goes  through the roof or do I lend -- as you say, lend to Uncle Sam and get me  two percent?  Which do I do?  OK.  I'm dead safe with Uncle Sam, I got it  but I'm going nowhere.  I'm taking a risk with technology, but I'm going  somewhere.  As for putting new money in now, that I'm not so sure of.  I'm  going to hold off on that, but as everybody knows, I do I own some  Microsoft and my point today is I'm not selling at this point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think Satya Nadella of Microsoft makes better decisions  with your money or Congress?  We already pay taxes, that's -- I know that's  a little simplistic but I always think -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> VARNEY:  No, it's a loaded question.  That's what it is.  You know where  I'm coming from too.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're fantastic each and every day.</p><p> VARNEY:  I do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart is coming up in almost exactly 15 minutes.  A reminder,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Three whole hours of  Mr. Stuart Varney.  </p><p> The first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter coming  in much better than expected.  Nicole Petallides on floor at the New York  Stock Exchange.  Hey, Nicole. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good Friday morning, Dagen.  Yes, that's  right.  We're seeing the economy here in the U.S. in the latest quarter  grow faster than expected, at three percent rate faster than the 2.5  percent rate that was expected.  Why did that happen?  That was consumer  and also business spending that helped it along and that's why you did see  that growth there despite Harvey and Irma.  </p><p> Taking a look at Futures right now, up 17 points for the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  We'll see if we can make some records today.  Taking a  look at Merck, though, Dow component, Merck, that is to the downside this  morning, sales dropped three percent overall.  It did very well with  KEYTRUDA.  That is their U.S. long -- that's a cancer patient -- U.S.  cancer -- lung cancer and that really helped them along but not enough to  break through.  Stock down 2-1/2 percent, profit beat, they raised the  outlook but a sales miss overall.  </p><p> Then there's Colgate-Palmolive, so that was relatively flat.  Let's take a  look at that.  It did ramp up ad spending, about 20 percent ramped that up,  and that cut into the numbers.  That is down one-third of one percent.  And  good old G.E., well, G.E., of course, you know, we reported recently how  it's dropped out of the dividend portfolio for Morgan Stanley.  Well, now,  they're exiting and saying that they want to exit out of the railroad  business.  Just not seeing the demand, it is a seasonal business, it is --  is it inconsistent, and they have so many others from aviation to power,  health care, just to name some.</p><p> So, this morning, we're seeing it up one-quarter of one percent, but we did  see those new lows as to -- on 10.26 of 21.20.  We're not too far off of  that, so people are holding to this one for the long term, they've been  ultimately very disappointed, and there is talk (INAUDIBLE) outlook they  might be cutting the dividend, too.  And that's why Morgan Stanley,  ultimately, tried to pull them out of that portfolio for wealth management  because it's not really what they're looking for big picture.  </p><p> We have much more, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, coming up right after this, happy  Friday to you.  Keep it here on Fox Business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If Tesla wants to revolutionize how we drive, Zero Motorcycles  who wants to take your love of the road to the next level.  No noise, no  vibrations, but all the power and torque of the best bikes out there.  It's  electric and it's the next great American brand, completely made in the  United States.  Joining me now, is Zero Motorcycles' CEO, Sam Paschel.   Tell me about the bike, Sam, because I'm a Harley fan, that's a regular  old-fashioned and internal combustion engine.</p><p> SAM PASCHEL, ZERO MOTORCYCLES CEO:  It is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And this is not anything like that.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It is.  This is -- it's the most innovative motorcycle in the  world.  If you're familiar with a Harley, something like a Harley Sportster  1200.  Will have about 73 foot-pounds of torque.  That's basically how much  force is being applied to that back tire to really give you the  acceleration.  Zero Motorcycles -- the bike right in front of us has about  116 foot-pounds of torques.  So, you're getting the acceleration and  performance out of a, like a modern day superbike out of one of these  electric motorcycles.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are you going after the audience that Harley Davidson goes  after?  What's your key demographic?  </p><p> PASCHEL:  The key demographics, we have three basic types of riders that  make up the majority of who we reach out to.  First, we have riders that  tend to have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  You know, the  electric motorcycle phenomenon, electric vehicles overall are still pretty  new.  In 2011, there were about 2,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States overall, four wheels, two wheels, everything else.  Flash forward it  last year, and there were about 160,000 plugin vehicles sold in the United  States and about 780,000 globally.  So, this phenomenon is catching on.   But within the motorcycle community, it's still relatively new.  So, the  three types of riders we generally get are riders who have a quiver of  bikes that have more than one motorcycle in the garage.  We get new riders,  people, that don't have that established connection with any one brand.   And throw a leg over a Zero and just fall in love with it.  </p><p> And three, and actually, probably the most common, we have riders who love  motorcycle riding at one point in their life, and then for one reason or  another, had a family, had kids, moved away from it, and now it's the lure  of electric and the differentiated ride that's really drawing them back.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've been on a Harley or eight in my days, and these bikes, they  don't have the roar and the rumble of a Harley that Harley riders and  devotees really crave.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It's true.  It's true.  If you think about riding a motorcycle,  and you've been on one, it's a -- it's an experience that uses all five  senses.  Three of those senses on an electric motorcycle are going to be  completely different than they are on a gas bike.  First, as you mentioned,  is the -- is the audio, the sound.  You're not going to have that same  rumble.  You're not going to have that same sense of sound.  You're going  to hear your surroundings a lot better.  You can hear what's going on  around you but you're not going to have that roar.</p><p> Number two, the smell and the fumes of a gas bike aren't really going to be  there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is my cologne.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Which is your cologne.  It's not mine today.  It's not mine  today.  It's the reason -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  -- I'm stepping on further way.  But third, and I think most  important is all the -- all the vibration that you tend to feel with the  gas bike, you don't feel with an electric motorcycle.  So the only thing  you're really feeling is your connection to the road and the ride.  For me  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  These are made in the United States, made in America just like  the Harley, so is that a selling point, too.</p><p> PASCHEL:  It's a huge point for our consumers.  The bikes have been  engineered from the ground up, designed and are all built in the bay area,  in Northern California.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How -- what are your sales like year-over-year, how much are  they growing?</p><p> PASCHEL:  They were growing in about a 35 percent compound annual growth  rate.  It's similar to what's happening in the E.V. space.  And two  dynamics at play, one, is a motorcycle market that tends to be a bit flat.   The second is an E.V. market that's growing rapidly.  Luckily for us, we're  tending to follow a curved of the E.V. market.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about other products that you might be looking at outside  of motorcycles?</p><p> PASCHEL:  So, we have -- we have three basic business segments.  The first  is the commercial motorcycles which are for sale to consumers and  motorcycles for us --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I interviewed the founder of the company years ago when the  first bikes were rolling out.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Yes.  Neal was fantastic; he was a NASA-funded engineer at one  point, and a mountain bike and a motorcycle enthusiast.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  The second segment for us is fleets and military.  It's a great  application for local police forces.  And third is this powertrain  business, where their companies that realize they're a little bit behind  the curve on electrification, we've got millions of miles underneath the  bikes, we've got 11 years of experience and they're coming to us to help  them electrify the products that they have already created. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sam, good to see you.  Please come back.  </p><p> PASCHEL:  Thanks so much for having us.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I wish I would get on one but -- I'm not wearing my motorcycle  pants today.  Sam Paschel, thank you so much.</p><p> PASCHEL:  Thank you so much.  (INAUDIBLE) come out to California and we'll  get your leg throw over a bike.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, on a day like today, it's a little chilly, I'll take even  Northern California, the coldest place on the planet in the middle of July.   Thank you so much, Sam. </p><p> PASCHEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's really good to see you.  Coming up, final thoughts from our  all-stars. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't know why that song reminds me of Kevin Kelly but it  does.  Final thoughts right now.  Erin, to you first.</p><p> ELMORE:  I drank a whole Starbucks, it's obvious, Frappuccino, so I'm all  juiced up today.  My vote is for Trump to keep yelling as a (INAUDIBLE).   Have a happy weekend.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kevin?</p><p> KELLY:  I'm going to bring -- wear my piano key necktie next time I'm out  here, and also it's important to note that CVS, only 14.5 percent of their  customers use mail order subscription through their pharmacy, Amazon is  coming for you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Lea, final thoughts</p><p> GABRIELLE:  So the Congress, the budget resolution, well, that was due back  in April.  It's almost Halloween, if they get started on next year's now,  then they might get it done by Independence Day.  So I'd say, get it  moving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And here's my final thought to the people in Congress, the GOP  who are writing that house -- that tax reform bill, if you touch 401(k)  plans and make this market tank, you're going to own that, and you will  feel the wrath of President Trump for your remaining days in Congress.  A  big thanks to Erin Elmore, Kevin Kelly, and Lea Gabrielle.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  Mr. Varney starts right now with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p> Stuart, I don't know it if I'm early or late, but it's all yours.</p><p> VARNEY:  I'll take it.  I'll take it, Dagen, gratefully.  Thank you very  much indeed, Dagen.  All right.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.
