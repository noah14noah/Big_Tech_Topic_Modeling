Illegal?\" Trump said in his tweet, adding that \"96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That 96 percent figure probably comes from an              article I wrote at PJ Media about what happened when I plugged \"Trump\" into the search engine's \"News\" tab. Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem. </p><p>In my article, I reported that 96 of 100 results returned were from left-leaning news outlets. In fact, nearly one-fourth of the results (21) were from CNN. (To determine which sites were right- or left-leaning              , I used              a               chart              from former CBS               News               correspondent Sharyl                            Attkisson              .) I stressed in my report that my research was not scientific and that it included only a small sample size (100               results). I did, however,              link to a report              from a reputable online-traffic software company that studied 2,000               search results and found that left-leaning sites received far more hits on hot-button political issues than right-leaning sites.          </p><p>The president, who likely saw a story on Lou Dobbs's Fox Business Network show about my piece, took that 96 percent figure and ran with it, calling for an investigation into the \"rigged\" search results and suggesting that the government might need to regulate big tech companies.</p><p>As a conservative who tends to be rather libertarian on tech issues, I beg to disagree. The government has no business regulating private companies for their political views, and it would set a dangerous precedent to do so in this case. Government regulation would only make things worse. The Internet would be less free, and fewer voices would be allowed to have a say.</p><p>That said, I'm sympathetic to fears that conservative voices will be silenced. Media reports, including one by Chris Cillizza at CNN, have been quick to lump Trump's tweets - and by association my article - into the category of an Alex Jones-style conspiracy theory, without putting it into context. Many of the media outlets chafed at being branded as a left-leaning site.</p><p>Here's a dirty little secret of the news business: No media outlet is unbiased. Even if a site isn't blatantly partisan, its biases come out in story choices and headlines that lead readers to certain positions, encouraging them to care about the things the media outlet thinks are important.</p><p>             There have been plenty of credible reports over the past two years claiming anti-conservative bias at the Big Three Internet platforms, including the 2016 revelation that Facebook had routinely suppressed conservative outlets in the network's \"trending\" news section. Further, when Alphabet-owned  YouTube pulls down and demonetizes mainstream conservative content from sites such as PragerU, it certainly gives the impression that the company has its thumb on the scale.</p><p>Many, including my PJ Media colleague Roger L. Simon, have suggested that there should be an investigation into whether these behemoth tech companies are violating antitrust laws. The president seems to share that sentiment, as does his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said Tuesday that the White House is \"taking a look\" at regulating Google.</p><p>There is no easy answer to this problem. But perhaps a better approach would be for consumers to refuse to let big tech companies dictate what news they see. These companies - cocooned in their Silicon Valley bubble where tech leaders are, by and large, liberal - don't understand the flyover states and the people who live there. I'm notoptimistic that these companies are motivated to fix this problem on their own or change their hiring practices to include a balance of liberal and conservative voices. And they shouldn't have to.</p><p>Rather, users should be proactive in seeking sites and sources they trust. When you find a site you like, visit it regularly and turn off your ad blocker or pay for a subscription. It costs money to pay writers and run a website, and if you're not willing to subsidize organizations you like, they might not exist in the very near future, leaving all of us at the mercies of Silicon Valley algorithms.</p><p>I wrote in my article at PJ Media that these big tech companies have the power to influence elections and even the state of democracy itself. I stand by that statement. And while the president might have gone too far in calling for government intervention, I agree that Americans need to pay attention to this issue.</p><p>Paula Bolyard is supervising editorat PJ Media.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-15bdaae2abaa11e88f4baee063e14538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T50-6X01-JCDY-T4B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><timeReceived>11:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGF</classCode><className>LIBERAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000369</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY</classCode><className>Conspiracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp;

Trump's fury was so great that he misspelled his own name in one of the tweets. But even more amazing, coming a day after his half-hearted attempt to deliver a call for unity in the face of two mass shootings, Trump cited the words of Kevin Cernekee, the Google engineer who was actively trying to rally internal support for white supremacist group[1]s before being fired. </p><p>The messaging between Fox and Trump continues to amplify the theme being pushed heavily by the right that says Big Tech is heavily biased against conservatives. In Congressional hearings and now potential anti-trust investigations, conservatives are trying to keep companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter from being too aggressive in their efforts to clamp down on fake news and propaganda that dominated the 2016 elections. Trump repeated his warnings that Google was out to get him this morning.@sundarpichai[2] of Google was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election, and that they \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2019[3] .in 2020.' Lou Dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the American public. @peterschweizer[4] stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Ttump. All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!; \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2019[5]This followed a segment by Fox News conspiracy theorist Lou Dobbs who had interviewed Cernekee, who has been making the media rounds to play up his claims of being fired because of his conservative views. Google had previously said Cernekee was fired for misuse of company property. Later, it was revealed that Cernekee was using internal messaging boards to encourage co-workers to contribute to fundraising effort on a right-wing crowdfunding platform to find the person who had punched white supremacist Richard Spencer on the day of Trump's inauguration. In another post, Cernekee offered on branding to improve the image of the Golden State Skinheads. Naturally, none of this is mentioned on the Dobbs segment.Check out what @Google[6] is up to for the 2020 election! #KAG2020[7] pic.twitter.com/roM2WNmUSP[8]; \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2019[12]Foolishness aside, the remarks seem to indicate that Trump has no intention of dialing back his rhetoric in the wake of a spree of mass shootings. And tech companies will likely only feel the pressure increase from the left and right, amid growing calls for greater regulation[13], and in some cases for some kind of move to break them up[14].

And he relied on information from the Media Research Center's TechWatch to do it.Before Trump signed the executive order[1] that interprets Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), he showcased a blog by NewsBusters MRC TechWatch staff writer Corinne Weaver[2] headlined 'Mueller Report Twitter Moments: 76 Anti-Trump Tweets, Just 1 Pro-Trump[3].'Trump said about Section 230: 'What we may do, Bill, is remove or totally change 230. What I think we can say is, we're going to regulate it. </p><p>It's a provision, and we're going to regulate it.'Grabbing a large printed copy of the MRC TechWatch piece, Trump slammed the site's bias: 'You take a look at this as an example: Twitter Moments on the Mueller witch hunt. So, we won. We were in the right. You see what's happened. It's a total fraud. It was a total fraud. 76 to one, OK? 76 to one. You look at it. You think that's fair?'Trump's decision to sign the anti-censorship executive order came after a fight with Twitter[4], in which two of the President's tweets have been censored[5] by the platform. Prior to Trump's comments, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also showcased the blog by Weaver.

And he relied on information from the Media Research Center's TechWatch to do it.Before Trump signed the executive order[1] that interprets Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), he showcased a blog by NewsBusters MRC TechWatch staff writer Corinne Weaver[2] headlined 'Mueller Report Twitter Moments: 76 Anti-Trump Tweets, Just 1 Pro-Trump[3].'Trump said about Section 230: 'What we may do, Bill, is remove or totally change 230. What I think we can say is, we're going to regulate it. </p><p>It's a provision, and we're going to regulate it.'Grabbing a large printed copy of the MRC TechWatch piece, Trump slammed the site's bias: 'You take a look at this as an example: Twitter Moments on the Mueller witch hunt. So, we won. We were in the right. You see what's happened. It's a total fraud. It was a total fraud. 76 to one, OK? 76 to one. You look at it. You think that's fair?'Trump's decision to sign the anti-censorship executive order came after a fight with Twitter[4], in which two of the President's tweets have been censored[5] by the platform. Prior to Trump's comments, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also showcased the blog by Weaver.

He is now at odds with a man who tapped him to be on the high court -- kind of. Why? Well, because behind closed doors with a Democratic senator, <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>said that he found the president's comments about the judiciary to be demoralizing and disheartening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's discuss with CNN host Michael Smerconish right now joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michael, what has made this now a point of intrigue is that the judge probably did himself a favor, may have even done the president a favor by saying what so many feel about his comments about the judiciary, but then the president tweets that <person><nameText>Senator Blumenthal </nameText></person>is misrepresenting the conversation but <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch's </nameText></person>own comms guy said he said it, so what's going on here?</p><p>MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN ANCHOR, \"SMERCONISH\": So <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>absolutely did the president a favor and the president has just refused that gift, and the favor was that he diffused this issue. Of course it's going to come up in the course of his confirmation process how he feels about the president's open comments about the federal judiciary, so he said what he said to <person><nameText>Senator Blumenthal, </nameText></person>which was heard by the Sherpa, the person who's guiding him through the Senate quarters, and he smoothed the path for his own confirmation. That's all good news for President <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>But, Chris, the president just can't help himself. He wakes up this morning, he fires off that tweet and what he has done by saying that the comments were mischaracterized by <person><nameText>Senator Blumenthal </nameText></person>is he's now set up a situation where <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>will be asked in public and he's going to come down on either one side or the other. He's going to repeat what he said behind closed doors or he's going to disavow it. If he repeats what he said behind closed doors then the president has just misstated the facts.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, but it's bigger than that, Michael. It's -- I mean, I think you're on to something and I think you're on the right path. But if <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>repeats what he said behind closed doors and what his communications director has confirmed what he said behind closed doors, then <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will feel that his Supreme Court nominee is at odds with him. And that can't stand. I mean, that's --</p><p>CUOMO: Well, what is he going to do? How can he -- what's he going to do?</p><p>CAMEROTA: I don't know.</p><p>CUOMO: Pull him? Pull the --</p><p>CAMEROTA: What is going to do? He doesn't like criticism in public from any of his people.</p><p>SMERCONISH: The pattern that we've seen here is one of just him the president not allowing any perceived slight to go unresponded to. Senator Coons a moment ago said that it reminds him of high school. Yes, there's a ranking. If you remember that whole process quality to this. Of name calling that is constant and never interrupted. But, you know, what's interesting is that many of the statements that the president has made that have been controversial go in the category of hyperbole and can't really be proven true or false.</p><p>This is not in that category. <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>is going to be asked whether he said that. Does he still continue to believe that? He's going to say either he does or he doesn't. And either the president will be telling the truth or he won't be.</p><p>CUOMO: Right. But he can't go back on the comments, especially after his comms guy said it. And I don't know that he should have. I'll take it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I don't either.</p><p>CUOMO: I'll take -- I'll take the other side. I don't think the president should be insulted by this because saying that the comments were demoralizing and that they were disheartening is different than saying the president should shut up or he is totally wrong or he's off.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Absolutely.</p><p>CUOMO: So, you know, maybe this is a win-win for everybody if the president can stop questioning the obvious veracity of the statements.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I think it would have been if he hasn't sent out that tweet this morning.</p><p>[07:35:02] If he could just remain silent on this issue to my original point and one that you made, Chris. He should have recognized that it was a good thing if the objective is for <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>to be confirmed by the United States Senate then it's a good thing that Gorsuch, politically savvy, has just diffused this issue but instead the president woke up this morning and he put it back in play. He should have said nothing.</p><p>CAMEROTA: But by the way, I mean, I think that <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>and any federal judge does need to, if asked, to say something about the comments because that reminds people that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>called the federal judge a so-called judge, thereby questioning his legitimacy. He also said blame him, that federal judge, if anything bad were to happen in this country and he also said about the Ninth Circuit Court, you know, that basically any high schooler could determine what --</p><p>CUOMO: They had surrogates out on the trail --</p><p>CAMEROTA: What they should have been able to determine it.</p><p>CUOMO: They -- and they did more than that. They had Blake out there on cable saying, you know, the Ninth Circuit really needs to be broken up. It's way too big. It operates, you know, 20 percent of the population of this country -- you know, which is odd timing for that kind of discussion. And then he said, I don't want to call the courts, the president of the United States, biased but he then said these courts are so politically which is exactly that. Calling them biased, Michael. Not good.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Well, and something else. You know, the conservative supporters of the president on this issue also are the first to thump their chests and regard themselves as strict constructionists or originalists is the verbiage of the day. Well, if you really are a strict constructionist or an originalist you need to respect the third branch of government and the independence of the judiciary and these sort of comments are at odds with a strict interpretation of the Constitution.</p><p>CAMEROTA: There you go. Michael Smerconish, thank you very much for the analysis.</p><p>CUOMO: All right. Quick programming note. The man you just saw, Michael Smerconish is going to host a live primetime special tomorrow night at 9:00 Eastern. \"Advice for <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person>\" I wonder where on the list just stick to what's true will be.</p><p>CAMEROTA: That looks great. All right. Meanwhile our other top stories. There's a massive winter storm. It is hammering the northeast as we speak. 40 million people in its path. We have live reports and the latest forecast for you, next.</p><p>[07:40:55] CAMEROTA: All right. The snow is coming down right now. As we speak. Chad Myers is live in New York Central Park. How is it going out there, Chad?</p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I'm noticing one thing, just weather geeking out there a little bit. The wind is shifting direction, Alisyn. That means that the low pressure that we expected to bomb off the coast is starting. The snow, the wraparound, the big low pressure that's going to get bigger because the ocean is warm that is beginning to happen as expected. 40 million people under some type of winter storm warning, all the schools, the public schools in Boston, New York, Philadelphia closed for today and many more other schools in other cities as well.</p><p>Other than that almost 3,000 cancelled and more cancelling as we speak. They're just kind of rolling cancelling now. I was just looking at the Delta Web site, United Web site, JetBlue Web site, it's just going one after another after another. So I don't expect too many flights to come out of here today, probably tomorrow because this is over. This is over by 2:00 p.m. so what we see on the ground right now, that's probably -- I would say this is five inches worth of snow.</p><p>Now there's not five inches of snow here because the first two inches melted when it hit the ground. The second two or three kind of -- kind of pat down or come -- just went down into that wet stuff and so we're not seeing these snow totals so you may never seen 12 inches of snow here but you certainly have seen the slowdowns and the roads. I haven't seen the plow yet except for these guys taking case of Central Park.</p><p>CUOMO: Strong point and a key distinction you draw there. The critical question for us, though, is, one, what is the packability of the snow right now for snowballs and one is the sled effect? Are we in the right place yet? How are you feeling about packing? Can you make a snowball?</p><p>MYERS: The snowpacking is -- sure. Absolutely. No problem at all.</p><p>CUOMO: Really?</p><p>MYERS: It's not even -- I can't even squeeze them anymore. There's so much water in that.</p><p>CUOMO: Good. Good to know.</p><p>MYERS: It doesn't fly at all. So we know that when the wind picks up, this isn't going to blow around much but this will be a snowball fight. In fact we did see two of New York's finest have a small snowball fight off their car this morning just in case they get in trouble from their boss, they are just having a little bit of fun.</p><p>CUOMO: They better not bring Chad Everett's way because he's got an arm like a cannon and a steel jaw.</p><p>Let's go to CNN's Jessica Schneider live on I-95 in New Jersey. That's where this can get really dangerous and is anything but fun. How is it right now, Jess?</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. We're getting inundated with snow out there on the New Jersey turnpike, Chris, and while Chad did not see a plow, we are right behind one. We're seeing a few of these out here on the New Jersey turnpike really this wet, dense snow that has really coated all the roadways out here. In fact one of the lanes out there on the New Jersey turnpike completely snow covered so we're headed northbound, people may be still heading into the city for a work day.</p><p>And you know, really what a difference a day makes. It was yesterday that we were in 60s. I was actually out walking on the streets of Manhattan in flip-flops and just a shirt, no jacket. Well, I have strapped down the snow boots now for this storm. And we're really getting pounded out here. When I got into work around 5:00 in the morning the snow was coming down steadily. Still now 7:45. The snow really starting to whip up. A lot of people of course staying off the roads, though. Not going into work, schools have been cancelled throughout New York City and Boston and Philadelphia.</p><p>We went by Newark airport must a little while ago, things are very quiet over there because about 1500 flights cancelled in the northeast around New York and Newark and Philadelphia as well. And really slow going out here on the turnpike. Right now we're going to about 25 miles an hour. There is still traffic out here but really the roads are really rough. We passed by a few accidents already so of course as everyone is saying, if you can stay off the roads, please do but definitely a lot different than we saw yesterday. The snow pounding out here on the New Jersey turnpike and going strong throughout the day -- Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Jessica, that is really helpful. It is really for people this morning to see what the roads are like and to see how slowly you need to be going so they can decide whether or not they want to take mass transit or drive into work right now. So thank you for doing that. We will check back with you throughout the program.</p><p>[07:45:01] All right. One of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>tweets taking aim at the retail giant Nordstrom for pulling <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump's </nameText></person>clothing line. Is the president defending his daughter or creating a new business conflict? We discuss.</p><p>CUOMO: Time for CNN Money Now. A big tech company unveiling a huge investment in one of its U.S. factories while meeting with the president. But is it all due to Trump's policies or something else? The answer from chief business correspondent Christine Romans in the money center. It's like the bat cave.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You know, an interesting past few days for tech giant Intel, Chris. On Sunday Intel told the court it believed <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>immigration order was unconstitutional. That was Sunday. Then on Wednesday Intel CEO stood next to the president in the White House announcing a $7 billion investment in a U.S. factory. He said that investment was due in part to Trump's policies.</p><p>The real story more complicated as it always it. Intel originally announced plans to build a factory with this guy, the former President Obama in 2011, saying it would put $5 billion into the Arizona plant. Obama even gave a big speech there at the construction site.</p><p>Now a spokesman tells us that was just to build the shell of the factory, it was never completed, there wasn't enough demand for the product.</p><p>[07:50:04] Now there is demand so the company says it's building up the rest of the plant. The president, by the way, today hosting another round of CEO meetings. This time the airline industry. Chief executives from Delta, Southwest, FedEx among others will be at the White House later this morning. We expect them to discuss tax regulatory reform, infrastructure, airport improvements and modernizing the nation's air traffic control systems, Chris.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, Christine. Thank you very much for all of that.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>conflicts of interest are in the spotlight again after the president fired off tweets attacking about Nordstrom Department Store for no longer carrying his daughter's fashion line. Mr. Trump tweeting, \"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by Nordstrom. She is a great person, always pushing me to do the right thing. Terrible.\"</p><p>We're joined by Norm Eisen, he's a fellow at Brookings Institution and was President Obama's White House ethics czar from 2009 to 2011 and Brian Stelter, he is a CNN senior media correspondent and the host of \"RELIABLE SOURCES.\"</p><p>Gentlemen, great to have you. We have a lot to talk about with you both this morning.</p><p>Norm, let me start with you. Is there something wrong with <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>who he says is defending his daughter and calling out Nordstrom by name?</p><p>NORMAN EISEN, FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Good morning, Alisyn. good morning, Chris, Brian. Yes, there is something terribly wrong with what's been going on. It's not just this bullying where Trump is attacking an American business because they have the temerity, they say, her -- Ivanka's line wasn't selling and they made a market decision. Then his press spokesman Mr. Spicer is pouring it on, claiming apparently falsely, that it was a political decision.</p><p>That is not what American presidents are supposed to do. He's blurring the lines between the government business and his personal and family business. His daughter has apparently maintained ownership of these lines. She stepped away from management. He may be invested in these businesses, and it's part of a long pattern of doing this. It's wrong. I believe it's against the Constitution and American law.</p><p>CUOMO: But just one more beat on this. How is it against the law? You mentioned the California Unfair Comp Law, the completion law. I looked it up. And it does talk about unfair business practices that used to fall into the categories of, per se, defamatory actions. But how is he doing that? How is this construed as a business act?</p><p>EISEN: Chris, when you put together the tweet, it started in Mr. Trump's personal Twitter feed. It was re-tweeted by the White House, in his spokesman's statements. They're making claims which Nordstrom says are false. It's not a political thing, it's not a question of fairness. It's a business decision they say. Ivanka's line wasn't selling. He's essentially libeling that company, he is injuring them. And that is exactly what the California Unfair Competition Law captures.</p><p>It has the broadest in the nation -- and Nordstrom has a lot of stores there. The broadest in the nation definition of an unfair business practice. And if making up these allegedly false statements about a business and broadcasting them from the White House isn't unfair, I don't know what is.</p><p>CAMEROTA: There was also this grassroots effort, Brian, started by a woman, it's called #grabyourwallet, it's a reference to the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Right. Right.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Sexual assault. And basically she put up a list online of every retailer and brand that does business with the Trump brand and suggested that people boycott them. Do we have any sense of whether or not that is what was behind this?</p><p>STELTER: Yes, L. L. Bean and other companies have been named in this effort. They've said they've had some success, not a huge amount of success we can point. There's also now of course anti-Nordstrom boycott efforts. Breitbart promoting the idea that people are cutting up their Nordstrom cards and refusing to shop there.</p><p>I just wish I could go to a store and not think about the politics behind what every store in the country is having to deal with. I mean, we see these companies at the Super Bowl maybe making choices. We see restaurants and grocers and retailers making these choices. It's complicated out there and it's a shame is everything --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Diffuse everything.</p><p>STELTER: Be about politics.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Everything now.</p><p>CUOMO: But either sales are down or they're not. I mean, that's going to be dispositive for Nordstrom's decision. Not that they have to justify it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: They say that they were.</p><p>CUOMO: But it's interesting. Obviously the president feels differently. He went out of his way in that tweet to say Ivanka tries to get me to do the right thing, almost defending, don't blame her for what I do.</p><p>STELTER: And as a dad, we understand that.</p><p>CUOMO: Right.</p><p>STELTER: But <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said he would be more restrained with Twitter once he was in the Oval Office.</p><p>CUOMO: Right.</p><p>STELTER: And we've actually seen the opposite, less restraint.</p><p>CUOMO: Right. And again there are different opinions on this.</p><p>Norm Eisen, I like the president being on Twitter. I like getting the first-sense impression of the workings of the president's mind, good, bad and ugly on occasion. But you get down to the same fundamental proposition.</p><p>[07:55:01] There is no law, with all due respect to your California, the extract of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that argument aside, this is about what is right to do and not right to do. And people will say this is who the president is. This is who we expect him to be and people voted for him, end of discussion.</p><p>EISEN: But, Chris, 75 percent of Americans including most of his voters want to have his tax returns. Why? Because they're worried about these business conflicts. Every president, both parties, 40 years, has made a clean break with their businesses.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>EISEN: And Trump's failure to do that is creating an overhang. It's very good for us. I like reading his Twitter feed as well. It creates a lot of media attention. I'm sorry Brian can't escape politics in the dressing room at Nordstrom's, but it's not good for the country, it's not good for the presidency.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>EISEN: Everything he does has a conflict issue. Even the Muslim ban.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK.</p><p>EISEN: Turns out he wasn't banning countries where he's done business which have more terror threats. So we're seeing a big scandal hangover.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK. Brian, we need to talk about this other mini-scandal. And that is, we've talked a lot about Kellyanne Conway's claim of a massacre, a terrorist attack in Bowling Green.</p><p>STELTER: Bowling Green. Poor Bowling Green.</p><p>CAMEROTA: She got a lot of heat for that.</p><p>CUOMO: She apologized.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: She apologized. There is another -- a similar claim from Sean Spicer that somehow we have not covered as much. He talked about another non-existent terror attack in trying to make his claim for the travel ban -- make his case, I should say, for the travel ban. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What do we say to the family that loses somebody of terroristic, to whether it's Atlanta, or San Bernardino, or the Boston bomber? Too many of these cases that have happened, whether you talk about San Bernardino, Atlanta. But I don't think you have to look any farther than the families that were -- of the Boston marathon, in Atlanta, in San Bernardino, to ask if we can go further.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Over the course of 48 hours.</p><p>CUOMO: Right.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What's the Atlanta terror attack?</p><p>STELTER: Still unclear what he's talking about. You know, that was something \"The Daily Beast\" first noticed this time yesterday. These three different mentions of Atlanta over the course of 48 hours. Maybe he was referencing Orlando?</p><p>I want you to know this time yesterday I asked Spicer what did you mean, did you mean Orlando? Did not hear back from him. However, ABC News reported overnight, he says he did mean Orlando, referring to Omar Mateen and that attack last year.</p><p>It's an example of sloppiness from the White House. And if Spicer is going to correctly hold the press accountable for mistakes, certainly we need to correct the record when we make mistakes, he also needs to be very careful in his words coming from the White House podium or in interviews. I think sloppiness is not a good look for any administration.</p><p>CUOMO: Or if we did that, we'd be hearing about it, you know, from the president for days.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: And you know what? Rightly so.</p><p>STELTER: That's right.</p><p>CUOMO: Because it raises a point. You know why he doesn't want to say Atlanta, something else has been a consistent theme. They don't want to talk about white extremism. They want to talk about all extremism being Muslim extremism. Even though, you know, you've got Camerota on the case now crunching the numbers on it, there's a much bigger threat from white extremism than Islamic extremism.</p><p>CAMEROTA: That is what happened in Atlanta, the Olympic Park.</p><p>CUOMO: Here?</p><p>STELTER: Yes, he could have been talking about Olympic Park bombing. CAMEROTA: Bombing 21 years ago. But that was white extremism.</p><p>CUOMO: That was Rudolph.</p><p>STELTER: I thought you're bringing up earlier this week with Duffy, what about Quebec? Why hasn't the president addressed it. Jake Tapper asked Kellyanne Conway, still no great answer to that question about the silence about that particular killing Muslims while they were praying at a mosque.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Brian, Norm, thank you very much.</p><p>CUOMO: All right. There is a lot of news. We have an interview with a man at the moment, the Senator <person><nameText>Richard Blumenthal. </nameText></person>What did <person><nameText>Judge Gorsuch </nameText></person>say to him and why is the president basically saying he's lying.

Among them are five former administration officials whose lobbying work potentially violates an ethics order Trump issued after taking office. </p><p>(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Forty lobbyists with ties to President Donald Trump helped clients secure more than $10 billion in federal coronavirus aid, among them five former administration officials whose work potentially violates Trump's own ethics policy, according to a report. The lobbyists identified Monday by the watchdog group Public Citizen either worked in the Trump executive branch, served on his campaign, were part of the committee that raised money for inaugural festivities or were part of his presidential transition. Many are donors to Trump's campaigns, and some are prolific fundraisers for his reelection.  They include Brian Ballard, who served on the transition, is the finance chair for the Republican National Committee and has bundled more than $1 million for Trump's fundraising committees. He was hired in March by Laundrylux, a supplier of commercial laundry machines, after the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance that didn't include laundromats as essential businesses that could stay open during the lockdown. A week later, the administration issued new guidance adding laundromats to the list. Dave Urban, a Trump adviser and confidant, has collected more than $2.3 million in lobbying fees this year. The firm he leads, American Continental Group, represents 15 companies, including Walgreens and the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, on coronavirus issues.  Trump pledged to clamp down on Washington's influence peddling with a 'drain the swamp' campaign mantra. But during his administration, the lobbying industry has flourished, a trend that intensified once Congress passed more than $3.6 trillion in coronavirus stimulus. While the money is intended as a lifeline to a nation whose economy has been upended by the pandemic, it also jump-started a familiar lobbying bonanza.  'The swamp is alive and well in Washington, D.C.,' said Mike Tanglis, one of the report's authors. 'These (lobbying) booms that these people are having, you can really attribute them to their connection to Trump.' (Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Shortly after Trump took office, he issued an executive order prohibiting former administration officials from lobbying the agency or office where they were formerly employed, for a period of five years. Another section of the order forbids lobbying the administration by former political appointees for the remainder of Trump's time in office.  Yet five lobbyists who are former administration officials have potentially done just that during the coronavirus lobbying boom:  \u2014 Courtney Lawrence was a former deputy assistant secretary for legislation in the Department of Health and Human Services in 2017 and 2018. She became a lobbyist for Cigna in 2018 and is listed as part of a team that has lobbied HHS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and at least two other agencies. Cigna did not respond to a request for comment.  \u2014 Shannon McGahn, the wife of former White House counsel Don McGahn, worked in 2017 and 2018 as a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. She then joined the National Association of Realtors as its top lobbyist and is listed on disclosures as part of a team that has lobbied both houses of Congress, plus six agencies, including the Treasury Department. The Realtors association did not respond to a request for comment.  \u2014 Jordan Stoick is the vice president of government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. Stoick's biography on NAM's website indicates that he is 'NAM's lead lobbyist in Washington,\" where he started working after serving as a senior adviser in the Treasury Department. Disclosures indicate that Stoick and his colleagues lobbied both houses of Congress plus at least five executive branch agencies, including Treasury.  'NAM carefully adheres to the legal and ethical rules regulating lobbying activity, including ensuring that its employees comply with all applicable prohibitions on contacting their former employers,\" Linda Kelly, the organization's general counsel, said in a statement. \u2014 Geoffrey Burr joined the firm Brownstein Hyatt after serving as chief of staff to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. The firm's lobbying disclosure for the first quarter of 2020 includes Burr on a list of lobbyists who contacted the White House and Congress on coronavirus-related matters on behalf of McDonald's. \u2014 Emily Felder joined Brownstein Hyatt after leaving the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, where she worked in the legislative office. Felder is listed on a disclosure from the first quarter of 2020 that shows she was part of a team that lobbied Congress and the White House. A spokeswoman for the firm said both Felder and Burr abide by the Trump administration's ethics rules, which limit their lobbying to the House and the Senate.  'We are confident that our lobbyists are in compliance with all lobbying rules and applicable prohibitions and did not violate their Trump Administration pledge,\" spokeswoman Lara Day said in a statement.  Public Citizen's Craig Holman, who himself is a registered lobbyist, said the group intends to file ethics complaints with the White House. But he's not optimistic that they will lead to anything. Last year, he filed more than 30 complaints, all of which were either ignored or rejected. \"There does not appear to be anyone who is enforcing the executive order,' Holman said. Companies Mentioned in This Article Top Ten Brokerages You Can Trust[1]There are more than 500 brokerages and research houses that hire analysts to issue ratings and recommendations. Collectively, these brokerages and their analysts publish approximately 175,000 ratings each year. Every trading day, there are nearly 700 reports and recommendations that are released to the public. To say that it's difficult to separate the signal from the noise when interpreting this data would be an understatement.MarketBeat has developed a system to track each brokerage and research house's stock recommendations and score them based on their past performance. If Goldman Sachs predicted that Apple's stock price was going to hit $150.00 on a specific date, how accurate were they? If Bank of America issued a \"strong buy\" rating on a stock, how did that stock perform compared to the broader market over the following twelve months. This tracking system has been applied to the 650,000+ ratings that MarketBeat has tracked during the last five years to identify which brokerages you can really trust (and which you can safely ignore). This slide show lists the 10 brokerages who have issued the most accurate analyst recommendations over the past several years, as measured by the performance of their \"buy\" ratings and the accuracy of their price targets.View the \"Top Ten Brokerages You Can Trust\"[2].

US President Donald Trump said he will introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook, in an extraordinary attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized.</p><p><br/> The proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.<br/> Trump wants to \"remove or change\" a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.<br/> Trump said US Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation \"immediately\" to regulate social media companies.<br/> On Wednesday, Reuters reported the White House's plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation. <br/> \"What I think we can say is we're going to regulate it,\" Trump said before the signing of the order. \"I've been called by Democrats that want to do this, so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation,\" said Republican Trump, who is running for re-election in November.<br/> A reactionary and politicised approach, says TwitterTwitter called the order \"a reactionary and politicised approach to a landmark law\" and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would \"threaten the future of online speech.\"<br/> A Google spokeswoman said the order would harm \"America's economy,\" while a Facebook spokesman said it would \"encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.\"<br/> The order, as written, attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230. It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favourable to him.<br/> \"In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,\" said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.<br/> Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, said \"the president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him.\"<br/>Twitter's shares ended over 4 per cent down on Thursday. Facebook ended down 1.6 per cent and Google parent Alphabet Inc finished slightly up.<br/> Trump's tweets Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favour of Democrats. He and his supporters have levelled the same unsubstantiated charges against Facebook, which Trump's presidential campaign uses heavily as an advertising vehicle.<br/> On Thursday, Trump said there is nothing he would rather do than get rid of his Twitter account but he had to keep it in order to circumvent the press and get his version of events to millions of followers.<br/> He took to Twitter again Thursday night to cast doubt around voting by mail, tweeting the practice would lead to \"MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE\" and \"THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY.\"<br/> Controling fake news, hate speech The protections of Section 230 have been under fire for different reasons from lawmakers including Big Tech critic Senator Josh Hawley. Critics argue that they give internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organisations.<br/> Social media companies have been under pressure from many quarters, both in the United States and other countries, to better control misinformation and harmful content on their services.<br/>Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company's website late Wednesday that the president's tweets \"may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot. Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\"<br/> After labelling Trump's tweets, Twitter continued to add fact-checking and 'manipulated media' labels on hundreds of other tweets.<br/> US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's planned order \"outrageous\" and a \"distraction\" from the coronavirus crisis.<br/> Under the order, the Commerce Department has 60 days to petition the FCC to adopt new rules and then the agency will review the petition. It could take anywhere from 12 to 24 months for the FCC to propose and adopt final rules.<br/> Federal spending on online advertising will also be reviewed by US government agencies to ensure there are no speech restrictions by a company.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A-372005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-2341-JBYT-H061-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Companies have much greater power and more reach than any phone company in the United States,\" he added.<br/>The decree is a new step in the president's war against social media, but mostly against Twitter. Trump had given a clue Wednesday night that he was going to take some action with a tweet: \"Big tech companies are doing everything in their power to pre-CENSURE the 2020 election,\" he wrote. \"If this happens, we will no longer have our freedom. I'll never let this happen! They tried in 2016 and didn't lose. Now they're getting absolutely LOCOS. Stay tuned!\"<br/>The Bloomberg agency issued a draft executive order that Trump would announce. According to the document, the initiative could bring a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">barrage of lawsuits</emphasis> about social media companies because it lifts certain government protections that these companies have with respect to user posts.<br/>This kind of legal shield is applied based on the alleged \"good faith\" that companies have to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> remove or limit</emphasis> the visibility of certain tweets, videos or posts on social networks.

View original post here[2]. Once shielded by the logic of Silicon Valley's relentless churn of innovation - which dictated that no reigning tech empire could rule for long before going the way of Yahoo and AOL - tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google have been subjected to intensifying anti-trust pressure - Elizabeth Warren's \"Break up Big Tech\"s billboard is only the latest example. Indeed, big tech trust-busting has become one of the few issues in contemporary Washington that garners genuine bipartisan support.  Since the Trump administration swept into power two years ago in spite of thinly veiled opposition from Silicon Valley - as it was later revealed, big tech effectively conspired with the Clinton campaign to hurt Trump's chances - the drumbeat of unprecedented anti-trust scrutiny has grown steadily louder, facilitated by the president's own publicly-voiced suspicions. And on Friday, the levee finally broke. </p><p> Just before midnight on Friday, at the close of what was a hectic month for markets,WSJ[3] dropped a bombshell of a story: The paper reported that the DoJ has opened an anti-trust investigation of Alphabet Inc., which could \"present a major new layer of regulatory scrutiny for the search giant, according to people familiar with the matter.\" The report was sourced to \"people familiar with the matter,\" but was swiftly corroborated by the New York Times, Bloomberg and others. For months now, the FTC has appeared to be gearing up for a showdown with big tech. The agency - which shares anti-trust authority with the DoJ - has created a new commission[4] that could help undo big-tech tie-ups like Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, and hired lawyers who have advanced new anti-monopoly theories[5] that would help justify the breakup of companies like Amazon. But as it turns out, the Trump administration's first salvo against big tech didn't come from the FTC; instead, this responsibility has been delegated to the DoJ, which has reportedly been tasked with supervising the investigation into Google. That's not super surprising, since the FTC already had its chance to nail Google with an anti-monopoly probe back in 2013. But the agency came up short. From what we can tell, it appears the administration will divvy up responsibility for any future anti-trust investigations between the two agencies, which means the FTC - which is already reportedly preparing to levy a massive fine against Facebook - could end up taking the lead in those cases.  Though WSJ didn't specify which aspects of Google's business might come under the microscope, a string of multi-billion-euro fines recently levied by the EU might offer some guidance. The bloc's anti-trust authority, which has been far more eager to take on American tech giants than its American counterpart (for reasons that should be obvious to all), has fined Google over its practice of bundling software with its standard Android license, the way its search engine rankings favor its own product listings, and ways it has harmed competition in the digital advertising market. During the height of the controversy over big tech's abuses of sensitive user data last year, the Verge published a story speculating about how the monopolistic tendencies of each of the dominant Silicon Valley tech giants could be remedied. For Google, the Verge[6] argued, the best remedy would be a ban on acquisitions - a strategy that has been bandied about in Congress. Our best model for tech antitrust is the Department of Justice's anti-bundling case against Microsoft in the '90s, which argued that Microsoft was using its control over the PC market to force out competing operating systems and browsers. If you're looking for a contemporary equivalent, Google is probably the closest fit. On a good day, Google (or Alphabet, if you prefer) is the most valuable company in the world by market cap, with dozens of different products supported by an all-encompassing ad network. Google also has clear and committed enemies, with Microsoft, Oracle, Yelp, and even the Motion Picture Association of America calling for restrictions on the company's power.  But according to Open Markets' Matthew Stoller, the best long-term remedy for Google's dominance has more to do with Google's acquisitions. \"If you're looking for a silver bullet, probably the best thing to do would be to block Google from being able to buy any companies,\" says Stoller. 'Suddenly, you have to compete with Google, you can't just be bought out by Google.'  That might sound tame compared to Europe's billion-dollar fines, but it cuts to the core of how Google is organized. The company has acquired more than 200 startups since it was founded, including central products like YouTube, Android, and DoubleClick. The company's modular structure is arguably a direct result of that buying spree, and it's hard to imagine what Google would look like without it. More recent buys like Nest have fallen under the broader Alphabet umbrella, but the core strategy hasn't changed. Would Google still be an AI giant if it hadn't bought DeepMind? Probably, but everyone involved would have had to work a lot harder.  Even better, anti-monopoly activists would have a bunch of different ways to block those acquisitions. The Department of Justice's antitrust division hasn't contested Google's acquisitions so far, but it could always change its approach. The strongest fix would come from Congress, where Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has introduced a bill that would place an outright ban on acquisitions by any company with a market cap higher than $100 billion. (As of press time, Google is worth roughly $840 billion.)  We feel it's no exaggeration to say that this is only the beginning of what could become an epoch-defining story arch. And like every good story, this one will have main characters and bit players. As far as we can tell, one of the leading roles will likely be played by Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, a previously obscure Trump Administration official who is now in charge of one of the most consequential investigations in recent memory. Setting aside what it might mean for Silicon Valley, the investigation will also have major ramifications for markets, since shares of the big tech companies have been at the vanguard of the torrid post-crisis bull market. Though the influence of FANG stocks on overall market performance has waned this year, they remain hugely influential. Tech giants are far and away the biggest contributors to SPX sales growth  and they have generated nearly all SPX after-tax adjusted profit margin since the crisis.  Given that big tech valuations are often based, at least partly, on the notion that these companies will achieve an unassailable market position, an anti-trust campaign could be extremely harmful not just for publicly traded tech giants, but for the entire Silicon Valley pipeline, as @SuperMugatu explains. If the DOJ going after $GOOG[7] is (1) real and (2) indicative of anti trust being back and DC going after SF, SAAS is fucked. These names are all trading on bets that they get to some scale where they're intrenched and then get bought out.  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[8] Everyone in the business, myself included, will spend the weekend trying to figure out (1) and (2), but it's curious that $GOOG[9] is the name and not $FB[10] or others. An argument could be made that it's more ominous, as any progress against $GOOG[11] would likely be easy to carry over.  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[12] Regarding SAAS, the ownership concentration in high sales multiple names across sectors is fairly extreme. Damage to IPO pipeline, bullshit like $BYND[13] or $TLRY[14] (Basically, Cowen's 2019 banking business) could be severe.  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[15] So many portfolios in hedge funds and retail are so insanely overweight 1-3 factors here, this could cause some very serious cascading unwinds. Not saying it will, but the market structure set up is *nasty*, and could become self fulfilling. pic.twitter.com/Zeg41lQ0BN[16] ; \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[17] Serious thought needs to be given to: 1) what if big tech is out? 2) what's priced in? 3) who owns what? Correlation? 4) loss tolerance of those pools? 5) if that stuff unwinds, what becomes unfundable? What does it do to demand for IPOs, etc of the large Private VC/growth books?  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[18] A lesson I've learned the hard way before: when the growth guys are forced out, it's a long way down until the value guys step in. But this is across not just A sector, but 'the sector of the future.' A senior guy at Blackrock told me there was no reason to look anything but SAAS  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[19] Also, IMHO Trumo's DOJ doing this (if true) the day after engaging in a second trade war sort of takes the probability of him being a complete fucking idiot to 90+% and completely eliminated any 'he's actually got a plan' permutations. Or he's legit a world champ Jenga player.  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[20] Also would note active managers vol tolerance is at all time lows and many / most face existential firm risk after the last few years. They're not going to gut our major uncertainty here. Especially with a decent start to 2019 and macro + cycle ?????  \u2014 MUGATU (@SuperMugatu) June 1, 2019[21] As a counterpoint, it's worth remembering that the presence of two new business-friendly conservative judges on the Supreme Court will make the DoJ's job that much harder, and could ultimately tip the scales in favor of Big Tech winning this battle. News of the investigation could adversely impact shares of the big tech companies, which will in turn create a serious drag for the major indexes. For investors, it will be one more threat to a bull market which is already teetering thanks to President Trump's trade war with China (and now Mexico). We imagine we'll be hearing more about the probe through both official and unofficial channels in the coming weeks.

This followed the deadly Christchurch terror attack that killed 51 Muslims. </p><p>President Trump not only refused to sign on, but established a censorship reporting hotline.That didn't sit well with major liberal news outlets. Both The Washington Post[1] and The New York Times have written scathing pieces blasting the Trump administration. The Post condemned Trump for waging an 'evidence-free assault on social media sites for supposedly censoring conservative voices.'Opinion writer at large Charlie Warzel wrote in The Times that while he understands that online content regulation can be a 'minefield of unintended consequences' he asserted that for Trump, 'to turn one's back on that commitment isn't just lazy, its shameful.'Much like Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, the Liberal rhetoric on this has been schizophrenic. At the same time that they have stressed that this is a mere 'ceremonial' or 'informal international pact,' the media have expressed panic that Trump has refused to join.The Post editorial board said that Trump's pursuit of an 'antitech crusade' while rejecting calls for speech regulation is 'a bitter reminder of how the Trump administration has abdicated leadership on the crucial questions of the digital age.'Both pieces have tried to gaslight the Trump administration's concerns about censorship of conservatives, pretending they are irrational.The Post accused the administration of an 'evidence-free assault' on Big Tech, and claimed they 'sacrificed credibility entirely by continuing to try to bully platforms into privileging the president's personal politics.'Warzel's article 'Why Can't We Fight Online Hate?' claimed the same Big Tech corporations who 'banned a number of pro-Trump figures for 'extremism'' have 'done everything in their power to avoid making overly censorious decisions.'Among the figures purged for 'extremism' were controversial but ultimately non-violent YouTubers like Jewish American activist Laura Loomer and Infowars contributor Paul Joseph Watson.Warzel then lamented the 'trauma' of 'of being subject to racist memes, slurs and violent imagery' further adding that the rise of 'online extremism and live-streamed violence is undoubtedly a mental health issue.' He warned that 'maximalist free speech for some may mean long-term psychological turmoil for others.'

This followed the deadly Christchurch terror attack that killed 51 Muslims. </p><p>President Trump not only refused to sign on, but established a censorship reporting hotline.That didn't sit well with major liberal news outlets. Both The Washington Post[1] and The New York Times have written scathing pieces blasting the Trump administration. The Post condemned Trump for waging an 'evidence-free assault on social media sites for supposedly censoring conservative voices.'Opinion writer at large Charlie Warzel wrote in The Times that while he understands that online content regulation can be a 'minefield of unintended consequences' he asserted that for Trump, 'to turn one's back on that commitment isn't just lazy, its shameful.'Much like Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, the Liberal rhetoric on this has been schizophrenic. At the same time that they have stressed that this is a mere 'ceremonial' or 'informal international pact,' the media have expressed panic that Trump has refused to join.The Post editorial board said that Trump's pursuit of an 'antitech crusade' while rejecting calls for speech regulation is 'a bitter reminder of how the Trump administration has abdicated leadership on the crucial questions of the digital age.'Both pieces have tried to gaslight the Trump administration's concerns about censorship of conservatives, pretending they are irrational.The Post accused the administration of an 'evidence-free assault' on Big Tech, and claimed they 'sacrificed credibility entirely by continuing to try to bully platforms into privileging the president's personal politics.'Warzel's article 'Why Can't We Fight Online Hate?' claimed the same Big Tech corporations who 'banned a number of pro-Trump figures for 'extremism'' have 'done everything in their power to avoid making overly censorious decisions.'Among the figures purged for 'extremism' were controversial but ultimately non-violent YouTubers like Jewish American activist Laura Loomer and Infowars contributor Paul Joseph Watson.Warzel then lamented the 'trauma' of 'of being subject to racist memes, slurs and violent imagery' further adding that the rise of 'online extremism and live-streamed violence is undoubtedly a mental health issue.' He warned that 'maximalist free speech for some may mean long-term psychological turmoil for others.'

All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!\" he added.The US President appeared to be referring to stories in the right wing media, promoted assiduously by some Fox News anchors, that Google is fiddling with search results to suppress conservative views. One such story featuring Cernekee, a Google engineer who was fired for purportedly promoting alt-right, white supremacist views, was aired on Tuesday morning, triggering off a furious Trump Tweetstorm, which one tech site snarkily reported said was so great that the President misspelled his own name (Tlump instead of Trump).Peter Schweizer, the other person referred to in Trump's tweet, is a right-wing journalist who wrote Clinton Cash, a 2015 book that claimed donations made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign entities influenced them, including how they changed their views on India's nuclear tests after contributions from Indian interests.Trump's teeing off at Pichai, including suggesting he groveled in the Oval Office, came even as ten US Senators, including White House aspirants Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, piled on to the Google CEO in a letter, calling on him to convert the vast ranks of temporary and contract workers in the company into full time employees, while describing Google's current practice as an \"abuse\" of worker classifications.Google is reported to have 121,000 contractors compared to 102,000 full-time employees, and the former are typically paid less (approx. $ 90,000 per year compared to $ 128,000 for full time workers) and have fewer benefits, which the company says is part of the standard industry practice.\"Google is valued at more than $100 billion, and your personal compensation topped $400 million in 2018, which makes it that much more difficult to stomach the mistreatment of these workers,\" the Senators' letter to Pichai said. \"It is not enough to insist that contracting and staffing companies pay at least $15 an hour and provide health care and paid parental leave because that standard is well below that set for Google's full-time employees. Google should convert contractors and temporary workers to full-time employees.\"Beyond the gripe about electoral manipulation and fair wages, Trump and the political establishment are increasingly coming to the view that big technology companies have become monopolies that need to be regulated or even broken up.\"Google has too much power, and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else,\" Elizabeth Warren said recently. \"It's time to fight back. That's why I have a plan to break up Google and the other big tech companies.\"Trump, on his part, has railed against Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos owns Washington Post, which has been excoriating the President for his racist views.

He turned to his Twitter account - where else? - to tweet his threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.</p><p> Tech giants \"silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, \"Big Action to follow.\"</p><p> He repeated his unsubstantiated claim - which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley - that expanding mail-in voting \"would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.\"</p><p>Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer.</p><p> Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack - which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.</p><p> Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted that \"mail boxes will be robbed,\" among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" that guides users to a Twitter \"moments\" page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.</p><p> Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.\" His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's \"clear political bias\" had led the campaign to pull \"all our advertising from Twitter months ago.\" Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.</p><p> Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.</p><p> But some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \"platforms\" under federal law - or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.</p><p> The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.</p><p> \"Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. \"... Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks, Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies.</p><p> Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The review is designed to go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector that were crafted by the department and the Federal Trade Commission.The two agencies, which share antitrust enforcement authority, in recent months worked out which one of them would take the lead on exploring different issues involving the big four tech giants. </p><p>Thoseturf agreements caused a stir in the tech industry[5]and rattled investors. Now, the new Justice Department review could amplify the risk, because some of those companies could face antitrust claims from both the Justice Department and the FTC.TheFTC in February created its own task force[6]to monitor competition in the tech sector; that team's work is ongoing.The Justice Department will examine issues including how the most dominant tech firms have grown in size and might\u2014and expanded their reach into additional businesses.The Justice Department also is interested in how Big Tech has leveraged the powers that come with having very large networks of users, the department said.

Hand shakes and hugs, Trump and Macron certainly have rapport, but will that be enough to accomplish the real agreement, particularly on the fits to the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And plastic everywhere, in our seas, in our fish, even deep in the oceans around the North Pole. We have shocking new findings from the Arctic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: If there's one thing that Donald Trump is known for it's the colorful way he describes people in power. The President of the United States calls James Comey a slime ball, Hillary Clinton crooked, and Joe Biden crazy, but in Mr. Trump's world, Kim Jong-un is very honorable.</p><p>Now, that's quite a shift in tone from little rocket man. Now just two days ahead of the historic summit between the Koreas, Mr. Trump says his own meeting with the North Korean leader will take place very soon.</p><p>Our own Paula Hancocks is in Seoul, and she joins us now. And, Paula, wow. Trump's rhetorical U-turn on Kim Jong-un is quite dramatic. How are Korean officials reacting to it?</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, I haven't heard a single official reaction to Donald Trump's comments, and it's not really surprising. Nobody wants to be associated with that kind of comment.</p><p>Nobody wants this to be tainted just two days away from an incredibly important summit for the South Koreans, so they're really focusing on the summit itself.</p><p>They're not being brought into those kinds of questions. But I did speak to someone fairly close to President Moon Jae-in today, the spokesperson for the Ruling Party, and asked him what exactly would constitute a win for Mr. Moon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARK BUMKYE (ph), SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER: If north and south can come out of the summit, and declare a denuclearization, and the end of the Korean War, it will be a huge success.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANCOCKS: Now, he also said that part of the summit would be decided exactly what denuclearized means to both of the parties, and so this is what the South Koreans are focusing on right now.</p><p>Obviously human rights groups are raising some eyebrows to say the least when it comes to the U.S. President calling Kim Jong-un honorable, as clearly, defectors would tell a different story, those who have escaped from political prisons.</p><p>Amnesty International for example said 120,000 -- around 120,000 people are still in those prisons where there are beatings, starvation. We talk of public executions when we hear of people escaping North Korea. So certainly it's not a word that human rights groups would describe Kim Jong- un as. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. So as you said, you know, officials there -- they are just keeping their eyes on what's going to happen on Friday. And the two Koreas, they held a joint rehearsal today, ahead of that out coming historic summit. How did the rehearsal go?</p><p>HANCOCKS: Apparently it went very smoothly we are being told by the South Korean side. Now, this was a rehearsal by both North and South Korean officials. They are going through this in painstaking, menu detail, apparently.</p><p>This is up at the DMZ, when there's going to be a greeting between the North and South Korean leaders. We understand they were even looking at camera angles today. They were even looking at lighting.</p><p>They want to make sure that this is picture perfect, and it is going to be a made for TV moment. It really is. We are expecting North Korea leader Kim Jong-un to walk from the North Korean side of the Panmunjom, the Truce Village, step over that lip of concrete, which is effectively the border, the MDL, the Military Demarcation Line, and greet President Moon.</p><p>Now, the exact details haven't been told to us at this point, but we have been told it will be an historic moment, clearly because the North Korean leader is going to step south of the border. That's never happened before. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, there are dress rehearsals for this upcoming meeting. The menu has been released as well, and it's caused a little bit of controversy.</p><p>In fact, Japan has lodged a formal complaint with the South Korean government over a dessert that they're serving at the summit on Friday. Why?</p><p>HANCOCKS: That's right, yes. This is a dessert which shows a picture, or a map of the Korean peninsula, and the South Korea, and the North Korea have actually added a part of what South Korea considers a South Korean territory, Dokdo, that is what an island that the Japanese consider Japanese.</p><p>[08:05:00] They call it Takashima. This is a disputed territory between South Korea, and Japan. They have been arguing over this small island, or pocket of -- two islands for a number of years now.</p><p>And the fact it's on the back of the chairs, as well the engraved wooden chairs that the leaders will sit in. So Japan is furious about this. South Korea has not said anything about this again. Again, they are just focusing on Friday. They're not letting any of these distractions be something that they focus on.</p><p>They really are trying to make sure that everything goes as well as it possibly can on Friday in the hope that the meeting, the lunch, then potentially afternoon meeting, and banquet can actually come out with something concrete, some kind of joint declaration, a statement, this is what the South Koreas are focusing on at this point. Kirstie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Got it. Paula Hancocks, reporting live from Seoul, thank you. Now, Donald Trump addressed another nation that the U.S. has targeted over its nuclear program, Iran.</p><p>And when talking about the 2015 nuclear deal, his mood once again seems just soften with the U.S. President saying that there could be progress in revising the agreement. So where exactly do we stand? Our Global Affairs Analyst Max Boot addressed some of the confusion earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Donald Trump was exactly right when he said that nobody knows what he's going to do, and probably including Donald Trump himself, I mean, he is incomprehensible, and confusing as you suggested.</p><p>Because, you know, one minute he's saying that this is the worst deal ever made, and then next minute he is saying, that was some relatively minor and cosmetic additions, or hinting at with some minor, and cosmetic additions, and he may well sign on to it.</p><p>So who the heck knows what he's going to do on May 12th, and of course he's also got to figure in the negotiations with North Korea where he seems ridiculously bullish about the prospects of an agreement with North Korea.</p><p>But I mean how is it going to look to the North Korean if he's trying to enter into the nuclear accord with Pyongyang just weeks after he torpedoed a nuclear accord with Tehran? So, all of these things have the fact to know the final decision.</p><p>And who the heck know what he's going to will decide or say, because we have seen in the past -- I mean, remember just a few months ago, Democratic legislators met with them.</p><p>And thought they had deals on gun control, and immigration, and then poof, those deals went up into thin air. So, who knows if this -- whatever Macron thinks he achieves with Trump will actually have any lasting consequences.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Max Boot there. Now even so Mr. Macron is optimistic about the Iran agreement, the French President said that he's looking to work on a deal that addresses some of the points of contention with the U.S.</p><p>The comments came after a long day of talks and later a state dinner. And in a couple of hours, Mr. Macron will do something not done by French leader in a decade. He will address the U.S. Congress.</p><p>And Melissa Bell joins me from Paris with the French perspective of the visit. And, Melissa, as we see this personal rapport continue to build between Trump and Macron, can that turn into progress on key policy issues like Iran?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is true, Kristie, that the question of precisely how the Iran deal is going to be redrawn remains a matter of some speculation.</p><p>There's very little clarity on the detail of it, and yet one really had a sense listening to that press conference yesterday that Emmanuel Macron has gone a very long way towards the American President's view going so far as to say that a new deal could be drawn up, one that included, considering Iran's influence in the region.</p><p>Including looking at the question of ballistic missiles, a number of things that the American President, we know, was concerned about. And Emmanuel Macron used his, of course, a very personal relationship has invested a great deal of capital -- political capital, Kristie, in getting that up, and running.</p><p>Because he felt that it was the best way to influence the American President. I suppose one of the questions here in Paris this morning is whether Emmanuel Macron who's been influenced by the American President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: There were hugs, and handshakes, and still more hugs. In fact, it seemed the two presidents simply couldn't keep their hands off one another.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I like him a lot.</p><p>BELL: So much so that Emmanuel Macron even got an Oval Office grooming.</p><p>TRUMP: We have to make him perfect.</p><p>BELL: But whatever the strength of the bromance, and the French President's hopes of compromise on Iran, once the journalists got Donald Trump started on the subject, things quickly got out of hand.</p><p>TRUMP: If they restart their nuclear program, they will have bigger problems than they have ever had before.</p><p>BELL: After the two men have had some time alone together, however, the American President did seem calmer.</p><p>TRUMP: We've really had some substantive talks on Iran.</p><p>BELL: So how was the whole extraordinary day seen from this side of the Atlantic? Well, this morning, only two of France's main newspapers bothered to mention it at all on their front pages. And even then, they don't give it that much space.</p><p>[08:10:01] What has captured the French imagination, however, on the inside of the country's newspapers is the whole dandruff episode, with a number of different publications wondering whether it wasn't troubling or strange. So do the French agree?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Super weird, and I feel he wants to show his superiority because he's taller or -- I don't know. I find it a bit like annoying.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I think that he's just teasing him just to say -- just to see how Macron reacts.</p><p>BELL: French T.V. was also, this Wednesday morning, digesting what has by any measure been an extraordinary day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it was staged, so they have a mutual interest showing how much they love each other.</p><p>BELL: One final image doing the rounds this morning here in France is this one, with the French President accused of following too blindly where the American President leads.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BELL: So you see, Kristie, the French are famous for a certain dose of cynicism. There is a great deal of it with regard to this bromance. How genuine is it, what do those very blatant shows of affection really mean.</p><p>And perhaps most importantly, what do they bring to Europe? The French President has gone quite a long way towards the American President's position. How will that translate in reality, was it too far to go, and what are the reaction of all the other signatures in that Iran deal be?</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, and I think that cynicism about the so-called bromance between these two leaders is something that many people have outside of France as well. We know that the French leader is going to be addressing the U.S. Congress very soon. Melissa, what is going to be Macron's message to America?</p><p>BELL: Well, I think it's the one that he's had ever since he set foot in the United States, and quite literally, Kristie, the first thing that he said as he landed on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, he spoke in English, he spoke in French, he has a one line in French that he had in English, that we, the United States and France are the guarantors of multilateralism.</p><p>That has been his message from start to finish. He is hoping to talk this self-avowed, proud unilateralist, and Donald Trump say to him look, it's all very well to put America first, but deals when they're stuck need to stand, and we need to work together to find compromises on what are complex, and global issues.</p><p>And he is no doubt going to repeat that to a much more receptive crowd, both on the Republican and on the Democratic side no doubt, later on today.</p><p>LU STOUT: Melissa Bell live in Paris for us, thank you very much indeed. Now, Iran is furious, attacking Mr. Trump's qualifications for revising the current deal. President Hassan Rouhani has had plenty to say. Amir Daftari has more from Tehran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMIR DAFTARI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is speaking out after comments from Washington with regards to the nuclear deal.</p><p>President Rouhani is saying that Iran will not be negatively affected if in fact the U.S. does walk away from the deal saying that others will lose out more than Iran. He also had a message for President Trump.</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through a translator): U.S. President Donald Trump says this deal is a very bad deal. Well, if it's a very bad deal, then why did you, the U.S. government, sign it? He said this is a very dangerous deal.</p><p>If that's the case, then did your predecessors not understand anything? Are you the discoverer of all things bad? You don't have any background in politics.</p><p>You don't have any background in, law. You don't have any background on international treaties. How can a tradesman, a merchant, a building constructor, a tower construction, make judgments about international affairs?</p><p>DAFTARI: The Iranian President added that President Trump wants to talk about the deal's future, yet, you had nothing to do with its past. So as far as Iran is concerned, it's either the current deal, or nothing at all.</p><p>They have held up their end of the bargain, and stuck to their commitments, and that a new deal, or new terms devised by France and the U.S. that doesn't include other partners such as Russia, and china is a nonstarter, and will lack any credibility. Amir Daftari, CNN, Tehran.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: You are watching News Stream. And still ahead, the Danish inventor accused of the gruesome murder of journalist Kim Wall has just learned his fate. We have got the verdict, next.</p><p>Plus, police are on high alert in India as a rape trial involving a self- proclaimed spiritual guru reaches its conclusion. We've got the latest developments, next.</p><p>[08:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: Coming you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is News Stream. Now, a verdict has been reached in the trial involving a brutal murder that shocked Denmark, and the world.</p><p>On the last hours of court in Copenhagen found inventor Peter Madsen guilty of killing Swedish journalist Kim Wall. Madsen was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>He pleaded not guilty, but did confess to dismembering Wall's body on board his submarine last August. Now CNN's Atika Shubert joins me now live from Berlin. Atika, the verdict is out, a life sentence for Peter Madsen. How did the court reach this decision?</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, this was exactly what the prosecutor asked for. So it's clear that the judge, and the two jurors as is the case per Danish law were convinced by the prosecutors' argument, and the Judge, Anette Burkoe, specifically said that she was in full agreement with both jurors. Take a listen to what he said.</p><p>She said specifically, that it was a cynical, and planned sexual murder of a severe brutal nature against a random woman, a journalist who had joined him on the submarine to do a story.</p><p>Now, the crux of the prosecution's argument was that this was a premeditated sexual attack, and murder, and what they did was they basically showed that Madsen was in to the S&amp;M scene, that he had sexual torture videos, that he had watched these snuff films.</p><p>But also that he had taken materials and equipment from his workshop to his submarine that he did not normally take, including the bindings that were used on Kim Wall's body, and a saw that he used to dismember the body.</p><p>Now, it's clear that this argument really made an impression on both the judge, and the jury. They agreed, and that is why you see that very high life sentence.</p><p>LU STOUT: And the question about Peter Madsen, how did he, and his legal explain, and defend his actions during the trial leading up to today's guilty verdict?</p><p>SHUBERT: Yes, it's interesting because Madsen's defense, and what his defense attorney said was that there was no proof of what caused Kim Wall's death. I mean, you probably remember in the course of the investigation, you know, Madsen basically had very shifting narratives.</p><p>First he said she hadn't died at all, that he had dropped her off. And then when police found the body, he admitted that yes, she had died but in an accident. He said one time that he hit her head -- she hit her head.</p><p>And then he said, you know, it was a problem of pressure between the interior, and the exterior of the submarine. And so he then admitted to dismembering the body.</p><p>Now, what his defense attorney said was that because they could not prove what exactly caused Kim Wall's death, he should only be sentenced for cutting her up into pieces, but clearly this was an argument that did not wash with the judge and the jurors.</p><p>LU STOUT: Akita Shubert, reporting live for us, thank you very much indeed for that. Now a court in Jerusalem has sentenced a border police officer to nine months in jail for killing a 17-year-old Palestinian during protest back in 2014. A CNN camera happened to be there that day, and captured the exact moment when the young man was fatally shot.</p><p>[08:20:00] We won't show you the disturbing video here, but it was admitted as evidence in the court. The guard says he was unaware there were live rounds in his gun, and he felt that he was shooting none lethal rounds. The court found him guilty of negligent homicide.</p><p>In India, a self-proclaimed guru has been sentenced to life in prison for raping a 16-year-old girl. Asaram Bapu is revered by millions as a living saint, and this trial comes at a hugely volatile time in India. Our CNN New Delhi Bureau Chief Nikhil Kumar has more.</p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF: It has taken almost five years, Kristie, but a powerful self-proclaimed Indian spiritual guru has finally been convicted of raping a 16-year-old follower.</p><p>Asaram Bapu was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday for sexually assaulting a teenager back in 2013 during a religious ceremony intended to cure her of evil spirits.</p><p>But, Kristie, a special court in the northwestern Indian city of Jodhpur handed down this verdict under a heavy blanket of security. Authorities here left nothing to chance, effectively sealing the city amid fears of protests by Asaram's followers.</p><p>In fact, the entire courtroom will move inside a high security prison to ensure that nothing disrupted the proceedings. Those lawyers that plan to appeal the verdict, the judgment that startling fall from grace for Asaram.</p><p>Before this case, the 77-year-old was an influential guru to millions of followers, both within India and beyond. He had scores of ashrams, or spiritual retreats in his name, and he had powerful political friends, among them, the current Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.</p><p>And he almost free from controversies, just months before this case in fact, first hit the headlines, Asaram was violently criticized for his reaction to the horrific 2012 Delhi gang rape. That case, involving a young medical student of the Indian capital who died from the injuries turned a harsh spotlight on sexual violence in India.</p><p>And Asaram always see things differently to the thousands of outraged Indians who came out to the streets to demand that more be done to protect women in this country. The victim he said is as guilty as her rapist. Today, Kristie, Asaram himself stands convicted of the same crime.</p><p>LU STOUT: Nikhil Kumar reporting there. Now, we are excited, and proud to announce that CNN has won a Peabody Award for coverage of the fall of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Peabody board of jurors cited CNN correspondents across key date lines, as well as the use of technology like drones.</p><p>They said this, quote, in addition to courageous correspondents, this notable set of dramatic reports provided fresh angles, and the creative use of technology including stunning drone footage that captured the size and scope of ruined neighborhoods. Now let's take a look at some of CNN's coverage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's like something supernatural or otherworldly has hit it. This destruction absolutely breathtaking, and really a sign of the dust, and bones that ISIS have left in their wake. The Old city Mosul, the damage new, the city gone, and Mosul almost free of ISIS.</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is one man's intimate revealing view of the battle for Raqqa. Resilient filmmaker, Gabriel Chaim followed Kurdish fighters for almost two months as they fought to take a strategically important hospital complex in the city's west.</p><p>He shared the same risks. The fighter's company, and friendship, and with a quitter reflected moment. Chaim left his helmet cam rolling through it all.</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We have been seeing in some drone footage exclusively obtained by CNN, the SDF already beginning to celebrate their victory driving around one of Raqqa's main roundabouts.</p><p>This is the roundabout where some of ISIS' worst atrocities unfolded, those chilling beheading, the horrific executions, and crucifixion. But we're also seeing these images as just the sheer breathtaking scale of the destruction.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is the moment Abdullah Nishrem has been waiting months for. The moment he finally gets to meet Marwan.</p><p>Abdullah was responsible for helping smuggle Marwan to safety. Marwan is 11-year-old. Three years ago, when he was just eight, he said he was abducted by ISIS, and forced to serve as a slave on that frontline. Since then, he's been sold on 11 times.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: This is News Stream. And still to come in the program, Facebook prepares to announce its quarterly earnings after a painful data scandal. How it can affect the company's bottom line.</p><p>[08:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching News Stream.

And, Madsen, pleaded not guilty to the murder, but he did confess to dismembering her body on board his submarine in 2017. He was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>In just about two hours, French President Emmanuel Macron will address the joint meeting of the U.SCongress. It will be the first time that the French leader has done so in a decade.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Macron held talks with President Donald Trump who hinted afterwards there could be progress in terms of revising the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>With historic talks possibly on the horizon, President Trump is now praising North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as being very honorable though he didn't explain why.</p><p>Now South Korea did a trial run of this week's the Kim Jong-un, and Moon Jae-in summit on the DMZ on Tuesday, we've learned that the banquet will include a special Pyongyang cold noodle dish symbolic because it's enjoyed in both Koreas.</p><p>The U.S. President says he is sending some of his top economic advisors to China in a few days for trade talks, and the delegation will include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared confident about the outcome saying, quote, I think we have got a very good chance of making a deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, a key player in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is leveling a serious claim about Facebook. Aleksandr Kogan telling the British the parliament the tech giant has been mind left and right by thousand of others.</p><p>Kogan is the Cambridge University professor who passed Facebook user data to the Cambridge Analytica. And he says the social media company is painting him as a scapegoat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEKSANDR KOGAN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE: But PR is PR, and they're trying to manage the crisis, and it's convenient to point the finger at a single entity, and try to paint the picture this is a rogue agent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, the data scandal is growing increasingly complicated. So let's refresh what's going on here. Facebook said up to 87 million users may have had their data gathered a few years ago.</p><p>Now that data was harvested by that personality quiz that was created by Aleksandr Kogan. The app collected information on users' location, friends, and data that they had liked.</p><p>It was allowable under Facebook's rules at the time. Now Kogan then passed that data on to Cambridge Analytica, an analytics firm. Facebook says this violated its terms of service.</p><p>[08:30:00] Cambridge Analytica was then hired by the Trump campaign during the 2016 election and the company denies any harvested data was used.</p><p>But now, suspended CEO, Alexander Nix, was shown at undercover reports boasting that Cambridge Analytica did, in his words, all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting for that campaign.</p><p>Now, needless to say, all of this is a black eye for Facebook and is set to release its quarterly earnings in a matter of hours after the most tumultuous period in the company's history.</p><p>Our Clare Sebastian joins us now live from New York. And Clare, Facebook's latest earnings report, when that comes out, is it going to boost confidence or is it going to just raise more concerns?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, I think it could be a little bit of both, honestly. In terms of advertising revenues, we're expecting, according to analysts, to see them grow around 40 percent or more. That would suggest that advertisers, of course, are not leaving the platforms in droves, which could be a vote of confidence.</p><p>But I think people who are really investors will really be looking closely at user growth, and in particular engagement, because in the last quarter, Facebook already saw a drop off in engagement, Mark Zuckerberg saying that 50 million fewer hours per day were being spent on the platform. That was because of changes to the news feed, few viral videos, things like that.</p><p>So, I think people will really be looking closely at the user numbers because, of course, the ads themselves are less valuable if there are few users looking at them. And the other thing they are really going to be looking at is investment.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg told Congress a couple of weeks ago when he was up on the Hill that making sure that the platform is safe and the privacy rules are being followed is more important than profits. The company is investing in doubling the number of staff. They're going to be policing content.</p><p>They're going to be up to 20,000 people by the end of the year. And then new artificial intelligence tools that are going to do the same. I think people are really going to be looking at that investment and whether or not that has, as he wanted (ph), eaten (ph) into profits.</p><p>LU STOUT: And Clare, we also know that Twitter -- and we haven't talked about Twitter in a while -- Twitter is also reporting today what is its earnings profile and how is Twitter addressing concerns about stealth marketing and data privacy?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: This is a big beat for Twitter. This is the second profitable quarter ever. The first profitable quarter was the last one, so this really signals the analysts that that wasn't just a one off, that this really is a company that is starting to gain traction after so long of not being able to grow its revenues and seeing really sluggish user growth.</p><p>Its revenues are up 21 percent. It saw its monthly active users up around 3 percent, which isn't the kind of growth that we have been seeing from Facebook, but still does signal that Twitter is on the right track.</p><p>As to privacy, well, they're one of several of these big tech companies who are combining their earnings with an announcement on privacy, Twitter releasing a new policy on privacy on its platform yesterday. You may have seen an update. So when you refresh your feed, it comes out with a little window saying there is change in policy.</p><p>That is partly because of new E.U. rules that are coming in next month. But it does simplify the language. It makes it easier for you to see how your data is being used. So, it's a company that knows that it's in the crosshairs of potential regulation that could come down in the wake of Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. And I think it's trying to get out in front of that.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, and I just got that alert as well just an hour ago. Clare Sebastian reporting for us live from New York. Thank you so much, Clare. Take care.</p><p>Now, an alarming new study. It exposes just how far plastic pollution has spread around our planet. I will be talking with the lead author about what they found inside Arctic sea ice and how it's linked to the Great Pacific garbage patch.</p><p>[08:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. You're watching \"News Stream.\" A troubling warning from researchers. Nowhere is immune from plastic pollution. A team of scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute, they found a massive concentration of microplastics suspended in Arctic sea ice.</p><p>Microplastics are little bits of trash about the size of a sesame seed or less. Samples contain ship paint, cigarette filters, food packaging, synthetic fibers and more. And just because they're tiny does not mean that they're not dangerous. Microorganisms like crustaceans often mistake the microplastics for food. Fish feed on the crustaceans. Then we, humans, we eat the fish.</p><p>You can see the evidence of microplastics in the food chain even here in Hong Kong. Recently, Greenpeace found 60 percent of flathead grey mullet, a popular fish in the region, contained plastic fragments.</p><p>Now, I want to give more on what scientists found in the Arctic from Dr. Ilka Peeken. She is a sea ice ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute, and first author on the study. Thank you so much for joining us here on the program. This is a landmark study. Were you surprised by the variety, the sheer number of different kinds of plastics you found in Arctic sea ice?</p><p>ILKA PEEKEN, SEA ICE ECOLOGIST, ALFRED WEGENER INSTITUTE: Yes, actually we were quite surprised about the high numbers which was up to more than 12,000 particles per liter of melted sea ice. There is a really huge concentration and much higher than we previously found.</p><p>The highest concentrations we actually found were coming from polyethylene and polyethylene is a typical material which is used for packaging like bottles and so on, so single-use products, and it is actually the most produced plastic in the world. So it's the one that we have recycled with traces (ph) on that.</p><p>But we also found a lot of particles which could belong to ship paint and we also found nylon which is indicative for shipping -- for fishing gear and we also found some cellulose acetate which is indicated by cigarette butts, so quite a huge variety of different parts there.</p><p>And we were actually able to pretty much -- by sectioning the sea ice coast in different horizons, we were actually able to backtrack the different areas. And so you can see that certain areas in the arctic have a different footprint of the - pulling (ph) that types you will find in them. So for instance we found one -- yes, sorry?</p><p>LU STOUT: It's so fascinating how you were able to find these microplastics, identify the microplastics and also track the origin of these microplastics from the Arctic and beyond. At the moment, they are stuck in the sea ice. They're kind of locked in the ice. But we know that ice is melting</p><p>So, what is going to happen with these microplastics? Are they going to be released back into the ocean and what happens then?</p><p>PEEKEN: So for sure they will be released. Particles of sea ice is reaching areas where it comes, for instance, warm Atlantic water where it starts to melt. And so it will be released in the water column again and from there it can be picked up either in the ecosystem or it might also aggregate because it can be combined with other material which basically then helps them to aggregate and then sinks to the bottom of the sea shore.</p><p>We actually found in another study by Melanie Buckman (ph) last year particularly in the area where we have marginal sea ice zones, so that means where a lot of sea ice is coming in and out, that in that particular region we can find the highest microplastic concentration also in the deep- sea sediments.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. And once they are released in the deep-sea sediments, into the seafloor, into the ocean, it will be released into the food chain, wildlife affected, humans as well. So what's the solution here, especially when we're talking about microplastic pollution? Is it even possible to attempt to remove these tiny, tiny particles from ocean waters and sea ice?</p><p>PEEKEN: So I think this is not possible. If we think about it, 70 percent of our planet is actually belonging to the ocean and we are talking about particles which are smaller than the 20s (ph) of a millimeter, so I think there is no way to get it out.</p><p>So we've got a lot of material in already. I think what we need to do is we really need to close the tap of plastics (ph), which is coming year to year into the oceans.</p><p>[08:40:02] I think that really is something that every one of us can do something. We really need to change our careless use of plastic products and start to produce more environmental friendly items. We also should get the policymakers and companies to really work on this, that we kind of bend certain products and also enhance the production of biodegradable plastics.</p><p>LU STOUT: You know, this is such an alarming study, but it's an important one. Dr. Peeken, we thank you and your team for sharing your findings with us and do take care and thank you for joining us here on CNN.</p><p>PEEKEN: Thank you. Bye-bye.</p><p>LU STOUT: Finally, here on the program right here in \"News Stream,\" French, it might be the language of love, but during the U.S. state visit, the French President Emmanuel Macron, the hands did all the talking.</p><p>President Trump and his French counterpart, they were so handsy, touchy feeling with each other that it almost felt competitive, at times a bit awkward. Here's Jeanne Moos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): These two just can't quit each other when it comes to public displays of affection.</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I like him a lot.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): Get a room. Actually, they did. The Oval Office.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. You're a special friend. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>MACRON: Thank you.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): President Trump and President Macron didn't just shake hands. They had to add a pat or a hand on the back, taking turns, even a hand on the chest. They stared into each other's eyes and muttered sweet nothings.</p><p>MACRON: Thank you.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): Using first names, my dear Donald.</p><p>MACRON: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Emmanuel and myself.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): Dialogue out of a bromance novel.</p><p>TRUMP: I hope you feel the same way.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): The French president even tweeted the clasped hands.</p><p>(on camera): Brace yourself, bet you never have seen this before. One world leader grooming the other?</p><p>TRUMP: We do have a very special relationship. In fact, I'll get that little piece of dandruff off him. We have to make him perfect.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): One French newspaper called the gesture disturbing. We noticed Macron later examining the spot President Trump flipped. The first lady was less accessible. Her hat made attempts to air kiss even a wider miss than usual.</p><p>Tweeted one critic, that hat is called the Trump repellent hat. As they posed for pictures, the president and Melania seemed to play footsie with their fingers which the \"Daily Show\" put to music. But the presidents couldn't keep their hands apart.</p><p>MACRON: Thank you.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): All the hugging left them so slap happy.</p><p>TRUMP: It's an honor to call you my friend.</p><p>MOOS (voice over): That President Trump missed a slap, the French disconnection, rare for these two.</p><p>Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Kristie Lu Stout. Don't go anywhere. \"World Sport\" with Amanda Davis is next.</p><p>[08:45:00] (WORLD SPORT)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018042501cbk31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S63-MPN1-DXH2-621R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 25, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hand  shakes and hugs, Trump and Macron certainly have rapport, but will that be  enough to accomplish the real agreement, particularly on the fits to the  Iran nuclear deal.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And plastic everywhere, in our seas, in our fish, even deep in the oceans  around the North Pole.  We have shocking new findings from the Arctic.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  If there's one thing that Donald Trump is known for it's the  colorful way he describes people in power.  The President of the United  States calls James Comey a slime ball, Hillary Clinton crooked, and Joe  Biden crazy, but in Mr. Trump's world, Kim Jong-un is very honorable.  </p><p>Now, that's quite a shift in tone from little rocket man.  Now just two  days ahead of the historic summit between the Koreas, Mr. Trump says his  own meeting with the North Korean leader will take place very soon.  </p><p>Our own Paula Hancocks is in Seoul, and she joins us now.  And, Paula, wow.   Trump's rhetorical U-turn on Kim Jong-un is quite dramatic.  How are Korean  officials reacting to it?  </p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kristie, I haven't heard a single  official reaction to Donald Trump's comments, and it's not really  surprising.  Nobody wants to be associated with that kind of comment.  </p><p>Nobody wants this to be tainted just two days away from an incredibly  important summit for the South Koreans, so they're really focusing on the  summit itself.  </p><p>They're not being brought into those kinds of questions.  But I did speak  to someone fairly close to President Moon Jae-in today, the spokesperson  for the Ruling Party, and asked him what exactly would constitute a win for  Mr. Moon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARK BUMKYE (ph), SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER:  If north and south can come out  of the summit, and declare a denuclearization, and the end of the Korean  War, it will be a huge success.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Now, he also said that part of the summit would be decided  exactly what denuclearized means to both of the parties, and so this is  what the South Koreans are focusing on right now.  </p><p>Obviously human rights groups are raising some eyebrows to say the least  when it comes to the U.S. President calling Kim Jong-un honorable, as  clearly, defectors would tell a different story, those who have escaped  from political prisons. </p><p>Amnesty International for example said 120,000 -- around 120,000 people are  still in those prisons where there are beatings, starvation.  We talk of  public executions when we hear of people escaping North Korea.  So  certainly it's not a word that human rights groups would describe Kim Jong- un as.  Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes.  So as you said, you know, officials there -- they are just  keeping their eyes on what's going to happen on Friday.  And the two  Koreas, they held a joint rehearsal today, ahead of that out coming  historic summit.  How did the rehearsal go?  </p><p>HANCOCKS:  Apparently it went very smoothly we are being told by the South  Korean side.  Now, this was a rehearsal by both North and South Korean  officials.  They are going through this in painstaking, menu detail,  apparently.  </p><p>This is up at the DMZ, when there's going to be a greeting between the  North and South Korean leaders.  We understand they were even looking at  camera angles today.  They were even looking at lighting.  </p><p>They want to make sure that this is picture perfect, and it is going to be  a made for TV moment.  It really is.  We are expecting North Korea leader  Kim Jong-un to walk from the North Korean side of the Panmunjom, the Truce  Village, step over that lip of concrete, which is effectively the border,  the MDL, the Military Demarcation Line, and greet President Moon.  </p><p>Now, the exact details haven't been told to us at this point, but we have  been told it will be an historic moment, clearly because the North Korean  leader is going to step south of the border.  That's never happened before.   Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, there are dress rehearsals for this upcoming meeting.  The  menu has been released as well, and it's caused a little bit of  controversy.  </p><p>In fact, Japan has lodged a formal complaint with the South Korean  government over a dessert that they're serving at the summit on Friday.   Why?  </p><p>HANCOCKS:  That's right, yes.  This is a dessert which shows a picture, or  a map of the Korean peninsula, and the South Korea, and the North Korea  have actually added a part of what South Korea considers a South Korean  territory, Dokdo, that is what an island that the Japanese consider  Japanese.  </p><p>[08:05:00] They call it Takashima.  This is a disputed territory between  South Korea, and Japan.  They have been arguing over this small island, or  pocket of -- two islands for a number of years now.</p><p>And the fact it's on the back of the chairs, as well the engraved wooden  chairs that the leaders will sit in.  So Japan is furious about this.   South Korea has not said anything about this again.  Again, they are just  focusing on Friday.  They're not letting any of these distractions be  something that they focus on.  </p><p>They really are trying to make sure that everything goes as well as it  possibly can on Friday in the hope that the meeting, the lunch, then  potentially afternoon meeting, and banquet can actually come out with  something concrete, some kind of joint declaration, a statement, this is  what the South Koreas are focusing on at this point.  Kirstie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Got it.  Paula Hancocks, reporting live from Seoul, thank you.   Now, Donald Trump addressed another nation that the U.S. has targeted over  its nuclear program, Iran.  </p><p>And when talking about the 2015 nuclear deal, his mood once again seems  just soften with the U.S. President saying that there could be progress in  revising the agreement.  So where exactly do we stand?  Our Global Affairs  Analyst Max Boot addressed some of the confusion earlier.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Donald Trump was exactly right when  he said that nobody knows what he's going to do, and probably including  Donald Trump himself, I mean, he is incomprehensible, and confusing as you  suggested.  </p><p>Because, you know, one minute he's saying that this is the worst deal ever  made, and then next minute he is saying, that was some relatively minor and  cosmetic additions, or hinting at with some minor, and cosmetic additions,  and he may well sign on to it.  </p><p>So who the heck knows what he's going to do on May 12th, and of course he's  also got to figure in the negotiations with North Korea where he seems  ridiculously bullish about the prospects of an agreement with North Korea.  </p><p>But I mean how is it going to look to the North Korean if he's trying to  enter into the nuclear accord with Pyongyang just weeks after he torpedoed  a nuclear accord with Tehran?  So, all of these things have the fact to  know the final decision.</p><p>And who the heck know what he's going to will decide or say, because we  have seen in the past -- I mean, remember just a few months ago, Democratic  legislators met with them.</p><p>And thought they had deals on gun control, and immigration, and then poof,  those deals went up into thin air.  So, who knows if this -- whatever  Macron thinks he achieves with Trump will actually have any lasting  consequences.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Max Boot there.  Now even so Mr. Macron is optimistic about the  Iran agreement, the French President said that he's looking to work on a  deal that addresses some of the points of contention with the U.S.  </p><p>The comments came after a long day of talks and later a state dinner.  And  in a couple of hours, Mr. Macron will do something not done by French  leader in a decade.  He will address the U.S. Congress.  </p><p>And Melissa Bell joins me from Paris with the French perspective of the  visit.  And, Melissa, as we see this personal rapport continue to build  between Trump and Macron, can that turn into progress on key policy issues  like Iran?  </p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it is true, Kristie, that the  question of precisely how the Iran deal is going to be redrawn remains a  matter of some speculation.  </p><p>There's very little clarity on the detail of it, and yet one really had a  sense listening to that press conference yesterday that Emmanuel Macron has  gone a very long way towards the American President's view going so far as  to say that a new deal could be drawn up, one that included, considering  Iran's influence in the region.  </p><p>Including looking at the question of ballistic missiles, a number of things  that the American President, we know, was concerned about.  And Emmanuel  Macron used his, of course, a very personal relationship has invested a  great deal of capital -- political capital, Kristie, in getting that up,  and running.  </p><p>Because he felt that it was the best way to influence the American  President.  I suppose one of the questions here in Paris this morning is  whether Emmanuel Macron who's been influenced by the American President.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL:  There were hugs, and handshakes, and still more hugs.  In fact, it  seemed the two presidents simply couldn't keep their hands off one another.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I like him a lot.</p><p>BELL:  So much so that Emmanuel Macron even got an Oval Office grooming.</p><p>TRUMP:  We have to make him perfect. </p><p>BELL:  But whatever the strength of the bromance, and the French  President's hopes of compromise on Iran, once the journalists got Donald  Trump started on the subject, things quickly got out of hand.</p><p>TRUMP:  If they restart their nuclear program, they will have bigger  problems than they have ever had before.</p><p>BELL:  After the two men have had some time alone together, however, the  American President did seem calmer.</p><p>TRUMP:  We've really had some substantive talks on Iran.</p><p>BELL:  So how was the whole extraordinary day seen from this side of the  Atlantic?  Well, this morning, only two of France's main newspapers  bothered to mention it at all on their front pages.  And even then, they  don't give it that much space.</p><p>[08:10:01] What has captured the French imagination, however, on the inside  of the country's newspapers is the whole dandruff episode, with a number of  different publications wondering whether it wasn't troubling or strange.   So do the French agree?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Super weird, and I feel he wants to show his  superiority because he's taller or -- I don't know.  I find it a bit like  annoying.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think that he's just teasing him just to say --  just to see how Macron reacts.</p><p>BELL:  French T.V. was also, this Wednesday morning, digesting what has by  any measure been an extraordinary day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it was staged, so they have a mutual interest  showing how much they love each other.</p><p>BELL:  One final image doing the rounds this morning here in France is this  one, with the French President accused of following too blindly where the  American President leads.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BELL:  So you see, Kristie, the French are famous for a certain dose of  cynicism.  There is a great deal of it with regard to this bromance.  How  genuine is it, what do those very blatant shows of affection really mean.</p><p>And perhaps most importantly, what do they bring to Europe?  The French  President has gone quite a long way towards the American President's  position.  How will that translate in reality, was it too far to go, and  what are the reaction of all the other signatures in that Iran deal be?  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, and I think that cynicism about the so-called bromance  between these two leaders is something that many people have outside of  France as well.  We know that the French leader is going to be addressing  the U.S. Congress very soon.  Melissa, what is going to be Macron's message  to America?  </p><p>BELL:  Well, I think it's the one that he's had ever since he set foot in  the United States, and quite literally, Kristie, the first thing that he  said as he landed on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, he spoke in  English, he spoke in French, he has a one line in French that he had in  English, that we, the United States and France are the guarantors of  multilateralism.</p><p>That has been his message from start to finish.  He is hoping to talk this  self-avowed, proud unilateralist, and Donald Trump say to him look, it's  all very well to put America first, but deals when they're stuck need to  stand, and we need to work together to find compromises on what are  complex, and global issues.  </p><p>And he is no doubt going to repeat that to a much more receptive crowd,  both on the Republican and on the Democratic side no doubt, later on today.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Melissa Bell live in Paris for us, thank you very much indeed.   Now, Iran is furious, attacking Mr. Trump's qualifications for revising the  current deal.  President Hassan Rouhani has had plenty to say.  Amir  Daftari has more from Tehran.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMIR DAFTARI, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is  speaking out after comments from Washington with regards to the nuclear  deal.  </p><p>President Rouhani is saying that Iran will not be negatively affected if in  fact the U.S. does walk away from the deal saying that others will lose out  more than Iran.  He also had a message for President Trump.  </p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through a translator):  U.S. President  Donald Trump says this deal is a very bad deal.  Well, if it's a very bad  deal, then why did you, the U.S. government, sign it?  He said this is a  very dangerous deal.  </p><p>If that's the case, then did your predecessors not understand anything?   Are you the discoverer of all things bad?  You don't have any background in  politics.  </p><p>You don't have any background in, law.  You don't have any background on  international treaties.  How can a tradesman, a merchant, a building  constructor, a tower construction, make judgments about international  affairs?  </p><p>DAFTARI:  The Iranian President added that President Trump wants to talk  about the deal's future, yet, you had nothing to do with its past.  So as  far as Iran is concerned, it's either the current deal, or nothing at all.  </p><p>They have held up their end of the bargain, and stuck to their commitments,  and that a new deal, or new terms devised by France and the U.S. that  doesn't include other partners such as Russia, and china is a nonstarter,  and will lack any credibility.  Amir Daftari, CNN, Tehran.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  You are watching News Stream.  And still ahead, the Danish  inventor accused of the gruesome murder of journalist Kim Wall has just  learned his fate.  We have got the verdict, next.</p><p>Plus, police are on high alert in India as a rape trial involving a self- proclaimed spiritual guru reaches its conclusion.  We've got the latest  developments, next.  </p><p>[08:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Coming you live from Hong Kong, welcome back.  This is News  Stream.  Now, a verdict has been reached in the trial involving a brutal  murder that shocked Denmark, and the world.  </p><p>On the last hours of court in Copenhagen found inventor Peter Madsen guilty  of killing Swedish journalist Kim Wall.  Madsen was sentenced to life in  prison.  </p><p>He pleaded not guilty, but did confess to dismembering Wall's body on board  his submarine last August.  Now CNN's Atika Shubert joins me now live from  Berlin.  Atika, the verdict is out, a life sentence for Peter Madsen.  How  did the court reach this decision?  </p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I mean, this was exactly what the  prosecutor asked for.  So it's clear that the judge, and the two jurors as  is the case per Danish law were convinced by the prosecutors' argument, and  the Judge, Anette Burkoe, specifically said that she was in full agreement  with both jurors.  Take a listen to what he said.  </p><p>She said specifically, that it was a cynical, and planned sexual murder of  a severe brutal nature against a random woman, a journalist who had joined  him on the submarine to do a story.  </p><p>Now, the crux of the prosecution's argument was that this was a  premeditated sexual attack, and murder, and what they did was they  basically showed that Madsen was in to the S&amp;M scene, that he had sexual  torture videos, that he had watched these snuff films.  </p><p>But also that he had taken materials and equipment from his workshop to his  submarine that he did not normally take, including the bindings that were  used on Kim Wall's body, and a saw that he used to dismember the body.  </p><p>Now, it's clear that this argument really made an impression on both the  judge, and the jury.  They agreed, and that is why you see that very high  life sentence.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  And the question about Peter Madsen, how did he, and his legal  explain, and defend his actions during the trial leading up to today's  guilty verdict?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Yes, it's interesting because Madsen's defense, and what his  defense attorney said was that there was no proof of what caused Kim Wall's  death.  I mean, you probably remember in the course of the investigation,  you know, Madsen basically had very shifting narratives.  </p><p>First he said she hadn't died at all, that he had dropped her off.  And  then when police found the body, he admitted that yes, she had died but in  an accident.  He said one time that he hit her head -- she hit her head.  </p><p>And then he said, you know, it was a problem of pressure between the  interior, and the exterior of the submarine.  And so he then admitted to  dismembering the body.  </p><p>Now, what his defense attorney said was that because they could not prove  what exactly caused Kim Wall's death, he should only be sentenced for  cutting her up into pieces, but clearly this was an argument that did not  wash with the judge and the jurors.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Akita Shubert, reporting live for us, thank you very much indeed  for that.  Now a court in Jerusalem has sentenced a border police officer  to nine months in jail for killing a 17-year-old Palestinian during protest  back in 2014.  A CNN camera happened to be there that day, and captured the  exact moment when the young man was fatally shot.  </p><p>[08:20:00] We won't show you the disturbing video here, but it was admitted  as evidence in the court.  The guard says he was unaware there were live  rounds in his gun, and he felt that he was shooting none lethal rounds.   The court found him guilty of negligent homicide. </p><p>In India, a self-proclaimed guru has been sentenced to life in prison for  raping a 16-year-old girl.  Asaram Bapu is revered by millions as a living  saint, and this trial comes at a hugely volatile time in India.  Our CNN  New Delhi Bureau Chief Nikhil Kumar has more.  </p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF:  It has taken almost five years,  Kristie, but a powerful self-proclaimed Indian spiritual guru has finally  been convicted of raping a 16-year-old follower.  </p><p>Asaram Bapu was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday for sexually  assaulting a teenager back in 2013 during a religious ceremony intended to  cure her of evil spirits.  </p><p>But, Kristie, a special court in the northwestern Indian city of Jodhpur  handed down this verdict under a heavy blanket of security.  Authorities  here left nothing to chance, effectively sealing the city amid fears of  protests by Asaram's followers.  </p><p>In fact, the entire courtroom will move inside a high security prison to  ensure that nothing disrupted the proceedings.  Those lawyers that plan to  appeal the verdict, the judgment that startling fall from grace for Asaram.  </p><p>Before this case, the 77-year-old was an influential guru to millions of  followers, both within India and beyond.  He had scores of ashrams, or  spiritual retreats in his name, and he had powerful political friends,  among them, the current Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.  </p><p>And he almost free from controversies, just months before this case in  fact, first hit the headlines, Asaram was violently criticized for his  reaction to the horrific 2012 Delhi gang rape.  That case, involving a  young medical student of the Indian capital who died from the injuries  turned a harsh spotlight on sexual violence in India.  </p><p>And Asaram always see things differently to the thousands of outraged  Indians who came out to the streets to demand that more be done to protect  women in this country.  The victim he said is as guilty as her rapist.   Today, Kristie, Asaram himself stands convicted of the same crime.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Nikhil Kumar reporting there.  Now, we are excited, and proud to  announce that CNN has won a Peabody Award for coverage of the fall of ISIS  in Iraq and Syria.  The Peabody board of jurors cited CNN correspondents  across key date lines, as well as the use of technology like drones.  </p><p>They said this, quote, in addition to courageous correspondents, this  notable set of dramatic reports provided fresh angles, and the creative use  of technology including stunning drone footage that captured the size and  scope of ruined neighborhoods.  Now let's take a look at some of CNN's  coverage.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It's like  something supernatural or otherworldly has hit it.  This destruction  absolutely breathtaking, and really a sign of the dust, and bones that ISIS  have left in their wake.  The Old city Mosul, the damage new, the city  gone, and Mosul almost free of ISIS.</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is one man's  intimate revealing view of the battle for Raqqa.  Resilient filmmaker,  Gabriel Chaim followed Kurdish fighters for almost two months as they  fought to take a strategically important hospital complex in the city's  west.</p><p>He shared the same risks.  The fighter's company, and friendship, and with  a quitter reflected moment.  Chaim left his helmet cam rolling through it  all.</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We have been seeing in  some drone footage exclusively obtained by CNN, the SDF already beginning  to celebrate their victory driving around one of Raqqa's main roundabouts.  </p><p>This is the roundabout where some of ISIS' worst atrocities unfolded, those  chilling beheading, the horrific executions, and crucifixion.  But we're  also seeing these images as just the sheer breathtaking scale of the  destruction.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is the moment Abdullah  Nishrem has been waiting months for.  The moment he finally gets to meet  Marwan.</p><p>Abdullah was responsible for helping smuggle Marwan to safety.  Marwan is  11-year-old.  Three years ago, when he was just eight, he said he was  abducted by ISIS, and forced to serve as a slave on that frontline.  Since  then, he's been sold on 11 times.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>LU STOUT:  This is News Stream.  And still to come in the program, Facebook  prepares to announce its quarterly earnings after a painful data scandal.   How it can affect the company's bottom line.  </p><p>[08:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching News Stream.   And these are your world headlines.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  A court in Copenhagen found Danish inventor Peter Madsen guilty  of killing Swedish journalist Kim Wall.  And, Madsen, pleaded not guilty to  the murder, but he did confess to dismembering her body on board his  submarine in 2017.  He was sentenced to life in prison.  </p><p>In just about two hours, French President Emmanuel Macron will address the  joint meeting of the U.SCongress.  It will be the first time that the  French leader has done so in a decade.  </p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Macron held talks with President Donald Trump who hinted  afterwards there could be progress in terms of revising the Iran nuclear  deal.  </p><p>With historic talks possibly on the horizon, President Trump is now  praising North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as being very honorable though  he didn't explain why.  </p><p>Now South Korea did a trial run of this week's the Kim Jong-un, and Moon  Jae-in summit on the DMZ on Tuesday, we've learned that the banquet will  include a special Pyongyang cold noodle dish symbolic because it's enjoyed  in both Koreas.  </p><p>The U.S. President says he is sending some of his top economic advisors to  China in a few days for trade talks, and the delegation will include  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  </p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared confident about the outcome saying, quote, I  think we have got a very good chance of making a deal.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, a key player in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is  leveling a serious claim about Facebook.  Aleksandr Kogan telling the  British the parliament the tech giant has been mind left and right by  thousand of others. </p><p>Kogan is the Cambridge University professor who passed Facebook user data  to the Cambridge Analytica.  And he says the social media company is  painting him as a scapegoat.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEKSANDR KOGAN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE:  But PR is PR, and  they're trying to manage the crisis, and it's convenient to point the  finger at a single entity, and try to paint the picture this is a rogue  agent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, the data scandal is growing increasingly complicated.  So  let's refresh what's going on here.  Facebook said up to 87 million users  may have had their data gathered a few years ago.  </p><p>Now that data was harvested by that personality quiz that was created by  Aleksandr Kogan.  The app collected information on users' location,  friends, and data that they had liked.  </p><p>It was allowable under Facebook's rules at the time.  Now Kogan then passed  that data on to Cambridge Analytica, an analytics firm.  Facebook says this  violated its terms of service.  </p><p>[08:30:00]  Cambridge Analytica was then hired by the Trump campaign during  the 2016 election and the company denies any harvested data was used.</p><p>But now, suspended CEO, Alexander Nix, was shown at undercover reports  boasting that Cambridge Analytica did, in his words, all the research, all  the data, all the analytics, all the targeting for that campaign.</p><p>Now, needless to say, all of this is a black eye for Facebook and is set to  release its quarterly earnings in a matter of hours after the most  tumultuous period in the company's history.</p><p>Our Clare Sebastian joins us now live from New York. And Clare, Facebook's  latest earnings report, when that comes out, is it going to boost  confidence or is it going to just raise more concerns?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:   Well, Kristie, I think  it could be a little bit of both, honestly.  In terms of advertising  revenues, we're expecting, according to analysts, to see them grow around  40 percent or more. That would suggest that advertisers, of course, are not  leaving the platforms in droves, which could be a vote of confidence.</p><p>But I think people who are really investors will really be looking closely  at user growth, and in particular engagement, because in the last quarter,  Facebook already saw a drop off in engagement, Mark Zuckerberg saying that  50 million fewer hours per day were being spent on the platform. That was  because of changes to the news feed, few viral videos, things like that.</p><p>So, I think people will really be looking closely at the user numbers  because, of course, the ads themselves are less valuable if there are few  users looking at them. And the other thing they are really going to be  looking at is investment.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg told Congress a couple of weeks ago when he was up on the  Hill that making sure that the platform is safe and the privacy rules are  being followed is more important than profits. The company is investing in  doubling the number of staff. They're going to be policing content.</p><p>They're going to be up to 20,000 people by the end of the year. And then  new artificial intelligence tools that are going to do the same. I think  people are really going to be looking at that investment and whether or not  that has, as he wanted (ph), eaten (ph) into profits.</p><p>LU STOUT:  And Clare, we also know that Twitter -- and we haven't talked  about Twitter in a while -- Twitter is also reporting today what is its  earnings profile and how is Twitter addressing concerns about stealth  marketing and data privacy?</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  This is a big beat for Twitter. This is the second profitable  quarter ever. The first profitable quarter was the last one, so this really  signals the analysts that that wasn't just a one off, that this really is a  company that is starting to gain traction after so long of not being able  to grow its revenues and seeing really sluggish user growth.</p><p>Its revenues are up 21 percent. It saw its monthly active users up around 3  percent, which isn't the kind of growth that we have been seeing from  Facebook, but still does signal that Twitter is on the right track.</p><p>As to privacy, well, they're one of several of these big tech companies who  are combining their earnings with an announcement on privacy, Twitter  releasing a new policy on privacy on its platform yesterday. You may have  seen an update. So when you refresh your feed, it comes out with a little  window saying there is change in policy.</p><p>That is partly because of new E.U. rules that are coming in next month. But  it does simplify the language. It makes it easier for you to see how your  data is being used. So, it's a company that knows that it's in the  crosshairs of potential regulation that could come down in the wake of  Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. And I think it's trying to get out in  front of that. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, and I just got that alert as well just an hour ago. Clare  Sebastian reporting for us live from New York. Thank you so much, Clare.  Take care.</p><p>Now, an alarming new study. It exposes just how far plastic pollution has  spread around our planet. I will be talking with the lead author about what  they found inside Arctic sea ice and how it's linked to the Great Pacific  garbage patch.</p><p>[08:35:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. You're watching  \"News Stream.\" A troubling warning from researchers. Nowhere is immune from  plastic pollution. A team of scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute,  they found a massive concentration of microplastics suspended in Arctic sea  ice.</p><p>Microplastics are little bits of trash about the size of a sesame seed or  less. Samples contain ship paint, cigarette filters, food packaging,  synthetic fibers and more. And just because they're tiny does not mean that  they're not dangerous. Microorganisms like crustaceans often mistake the  microplastics for food. Fish feed on the crustaceans. Then we, humans, we  eat the fish.</p><p>You can see the evidence of microplastics in the food chain even here in  Hong Kong. Recently, Greenpeace found 60 percent of flathead grey mullet, a  popular fish in the region, contained plastic fragments.</p><p>Now, I want to give more on what scientists found in the Arctic from Dr.  Ilka Peeken. She is a sea ice ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute,  and first author on the study. Thank you so much for joining us here on the  program. This is a landmark study. Were you surprised by the variety, the  sheer number of different kinds of plastics you found in Arctic sea ice?</p><p>ILKA PEEKEN, SEA ICE ECOLOGIST, ALFRED WEGENER INSTITUTE:  Yes, actually we  were quite surprised about the high numbers which was up to more than  12,000 particles per liter of melted sea ice. There is a really huge  concentration and much higher than we previously found.</p><p>The highest concentrations we actually found were coming from polyethylene  and polyethylene is a typical material which is used for packaging like  bottles and so on, so single-use products, and it is actually the most  produced plastic in the world. So it's the one that we have recycled with  traces (ph) on that.</p><p>But we also found a lot of particles which could belong to ship paint and  we also found nylon which is indicative for shipping -- for fishing gear  and we also found some cellulose acetate which is indicated by cigarette  butts, so quite a huge variety of different parts there.</p><p>And we were actually able to pretty much -- by sectioning the sea ice coast  in different horizons, we were actually able to backtrack the different  areas. And so you can see that certain areas in the arctic have a different  footprint of the - pulling (ph) that types you will find in them. So for  instance we found one -- yes, sorry?</p><p>LU STOUT:  It's so fascinating how you were able to find these  microplastics, identify the microplastics and also track the origin of  these microplastics from the Arctic and beyond. At the moment, they are  stuck in the sea ice.  They're kind of locked in the ice. But we know that  ice is melting</p><p>So, what is going to happen with these microplastics? Are they going to be  released back into the ocean and what happens then?</p><p>PEEKEN:  So for sure they will be released. Particles of sea ice is  reaching areas where it comes, for instance, warm Atlantic water where it  starts to melt. And so it will be released in the water column again and  from there it can be picked up either in the ecosystem or it might also  aggregate because it can be combined with other material which basically  then helps them to aggregate and then sinks to the bottom of the sea shore.</p><p>We actually found in another study by Melanie Buckman (ph) last year  particularly in the area where we have marginal sea ice zones, so that  means where a lot of sea ice is coming in and out, that in that particular  region we can find the highest microplastic concentration also in the deep- sea sediments.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes.  And once they are released in the deep-sea sediments, into  the seafloor, into the ocean, it will be released into the food chain,  wildlife affected, humans as well. So what's the solution here, especially  when we're talking about microplastic pollution? Is it even possible to  attempt to remove these tiny, tiny particles from ocean waters and sea ice?</p><p>PEEKEN:  So I think this is not possible. If we think about it, 70 percent  of our planet is actually belonging to the ocean and we are talking about  particles which are smaller than the 20s (ph) of a millimeter, so I think  there is no way to get it out.</p><p>So we've got a lot of material in already. I think what we need to do is we  really need to close the tap of plastics (ph), which is coming year to year  into the oceans.</p><p>[08:40:02]  I think that really is something that every one of us can do  something. We really need to change our careless use of plastic products  and start to produce more environmental friendly items. We also should get  the policymakers and companies to really work on this, that we kind of bend  certain products and also enhance the production of biodegradable plastics.</p><p>LU STOUT: You know, this is such an alarming study, but it's an important  one. Dr. Peeken, we thank you and your team for sharing your findings with  us and do take care and thank you for joining us here on CNN.</p><p>PEEKEN:  Thank you. Bye-bye.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Finally, here on the program right here in \"News Stream,\"  French, it might be the language of love, but during the U.S. state visit,  the French President Emmanuel Macron, the hands did all the talking.</p><p>President Trump and his French counterpart, they were so handsy, touchy  feeling with each other that it almost felt competitive, at times a bit  awkward. Here's Jeanne Moos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  These two just can't  quit each other when it comes to public displays of affection.</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  I like him a lot.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  Get a room. Actually, they did. The Oval Office.</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you. You're a special friend. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>MACRON:  Thank you.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  President Trump and President Macron didn't just shake  hands. They had to add a pat or a hand on the back, taking turns, even a  hand on the chest. They stared into each other's eyes and muttered sweet  nothings.</p><p>MACRON:  Thank you.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  Using first names, my dear Donald.</p><p>MACRON:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP:  Emmanuel and myself.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  Dialogue out of a bromance novel.</p><p>TRUMP:  I hope you feel the same way.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  The French president even tweeted the clasped hands.</p><p>(on camera):  Brace yourself, bet you never have seen this before. One  world leader grooming the other?</p><p>TRUMP:  We do have a very special relationship. In fact, I'll get that  little piece of dandruff off him. We have to make him perfect.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  One French newspaper called the gesture disturbing. We  noticed Macron later examining the spot President Trump flipped. The first  lady was less accessible. Her hat made attempts to air kiss even a wider  miss than usual.</p><p>Tweeted one critic, that hat is called the Trump repellent hat. As they  posed for pictures, the president and Melania seemed to play footsie with  their fingers which the \"Daily Show\" put to music. But the presidents  couldn't keep their hands apart.</p><p>MACRON:  Thank you.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  All the hugging left them so slap happy.</p><p>TRUMP:  It's an honor to call you my friend.</p><p>MOOS (voice over):  That President Trump missed a slap, the French  disconnection, rare for these two.</p><p>Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Kristie Lu Stout. Don't go  anywhere. \"World Sport\" with Amanda Davis is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:45:00]  (WORLD SPORT)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

There would be a role for antitrust agencies and the FCC, whose commissioners reacted along party lines to the EO. \"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" Trump said, claiming tech monopolies have \"unchecked power\" to censor and restrict human interaction.</p><p>Joined by Attorney General William Barr, Trump said Barr will work with states on regulations and develop policies that make sure tax dollars don't go to companies that the president said suppress free speech. Trump said he expects a lawsuit challenging the EO. Asked about the possibility of shutting down Twitter, he suggested he would if lawyers found a way: \"I'd have to go through a legal process.\" Twitter \"ceases to be a neutral public platform, they become an editor with a viewpoint,\" Trump said. \"I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook and perhaps others.\"</p><p>The EO directs NTIA to petition for rulemaking for FCC regulations defining the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Among the commission's members, Brendan Carr was most supportive. He called the EO welcome news.</p><p>Commissioner Mike O'Rielly defended the president while also noting free speech concerns that others also raised. He said although he hadn't seen the EO, Trump has the right to seek review of the statute's application: \"As a conservative, I'm troubled voices are stifled by liberal tech leaders. At same time, I'm extremely dedicated to First Amendment which governs much here.\"</p><p>Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said an EO that would turn the FCC into the \"President's speech police is not the answer. It's time for those in Washington to speak up for the First Amendment. History won't be kind to silence.\" Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said he will review the order when it's released, \"but one thing is clear: the 1st Amendment and Section 230 remain the law of the land and control here.\"</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., expects companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter \"to resist this illegal act by all possible means.\" He urged Americans not to give in to Trump's \"bullying,\" which may be the \"single most unpatriotic act an American could undertake.\"</p><p>Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., condemned the EO. His office said such FCC rules would \"most likely force internet companies to leave the door open to misinformation and disinformation -- and that would have wide-ranging consequences.\" Doyle noted the EO would direct the FTC and state attorneys general to police unfair and deceptive practices. Doyle said he supports Twitter's \"actions and the actions of any social media company that fact-checks or removes misinformation or disinformation from their platform, regardless of the source.\"</p><p>The EO appears designed to punish \"a handful of companies for perceived slights and is inconsistent with the purpose and text of Section 230,\" said Internet Association interim CEO Jon Berroya. \"It stands to undermine a variety of government efforts to protect public safety and spread critical information online through social media and threatens the vibrancy of a core segment of our economy.\"</p><p>Industry Concerns</p><p>Most in industry and advocates who generally seek more regulation as well as those often opposing it were united against the EO, in the hours before Trump signed it. We found one person who backed it, in an interview, while others told us of concerns.</p><p>Iggy Ventures CEO Rick Lane defended Trump's general concern, noting the \"power of big tech is a bipartisan concern. There is no question that internet platforms have amassed outsized influence over communication, commerce, and access to content, data and society.\" A longtime proponent for changes to Section 230, Lane said the unintended impunity created by the statute threatens public safety, competition, economic health and national security.</p><p>There should be a serious and informed conversation about the section, but the EO isn't a productive approach to holding the tech sector more accountable, emailed University of California, Berkeley School of Information professor Hany Farid: \"My hope is that this order will be challenged and struck down by the courts -- after all, the first amendment that the President claims to want to protect was designed exactly for this purpose of limiting government overreach.\"</p><p>Only Congress can remove 230, so the EO empowers the administrative state, said Committee for Justice Director-Public Policy Ashley Baker. \"It's also notable that it does so by asking the NTIA to direct the FCC to make rules,\" she said. \"Since the FCC is an independent agency, the president cannot directly order it to do this.\" C-Band Alliance consultant Preston Padden emailed us he hopes the FCC will stand firmly for free speech, especially for speech the White House doesn't like.</p><p>The executive branch can't just rewrite a law passed by the legislative branch, said Stand Together Vice President-Technology and Innovation Jesse Blumenthal. The EO is a \"bizarre hodgepodge of misreading the law and misunderstanding the government,\" he said. \"Censorship comes from government threatening to police speech,\" not companies handling speech issues on their platforms.</p><p>The Computer and Communications Industry Association, Incompas, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and NetChoice condemned the EO, in statements. Incompas CEO Chip Pickering said that \"promoting free speech while protecting our citizens from harm has always been a collective responsibility that is already enshrined into the 230 law and should not be changed.\"</p><p>\"All Americans should be concerned to find a U.S. president issuing executive orders in response to a company that challenges the veracity of his statements,\" said CCIA President Matt Schruers. \"Social media companies -- and all Americans -- have an inviolable right to comment on what our government says.\" ITIF Vice President Daniel Castro accused Trump of attempting to weaponize \"federal and state law enforcement and regulatory agencies to retaliate against an American company.\"</p><p>Public Knowledge and the American Civil Liberties Union also rejected the EO. PK CEO Chris Lewis said Trump doesn't have the power to rewrite the law. ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Kate Ruane agreed, saying the statute enables free speech by shielding platforms from liability.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6020-GRK1-JC8G-8000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1083\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Expect some pointed questions on how these companies police political speech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growing allegations that Facebook, Google and Twitter limit the reach of conservative voices and viewpoints on their platforms is the latest political crisis to engulf the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past year, censorship charges have become a conservative rallying cry, raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill. Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a  bitterly divided political climate, tech companaies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the big tech backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling.</p><p>Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>President Donald Trump claims that tech companies are biased against him.

Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a  bitterly divided political climate, tech companaies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the big tech backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling.</p><p>Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>President Donald Trump claims that tech companies are biased against him.

Expect some pointed questions on how these companies police political speech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growing allegations that Facebook, Google and Twitter limit the reach of conservative voices and viewpoints on their platforms is the latest political crisis to engulf the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past year, censorship charges have become a conservative rallying cry, raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill. Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a tense, bitterly divided political climate, tech companies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has met with prominent conservatives about bias.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week, the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the big tech backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>And in a White House interview, Trump told Bloomberg that some people see an \"antitrust situation\" with Facebook, Google and Amazon, but repeatedly denied to comment on whether he wants to break up these companies. \"I mean, look, the conservatives have been treated very unfairly,\" he said.</p><p>\"The greater the uprising, the more likely there is to be some type of action to create some kind of competitive market in social media that now exists in cable TV,\" Schnur said.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>The controversy touched off Tuesday after Trump sent early morning tweets accusing Google of manipulating search results to spread anti-Trump news and suppress pro-Trump news. Later Tuesday, Trump told reporters that in favoring liberal views Google, Facebook and Twitter are \"treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful.\" Google responded that \"search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology.\" Facebook and Twitter declined to comment.</p><p>The Trump campaign shared the president's tweets with supporters to drum up donations. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who for months has slammed Silicon Valley for bias, is using the charged issue in fundraising appeals. He's also pushing the #StopTheBias hashtag that the president tweeted last  week.</p><p>The president is taking aim at the very platforms credited with his political rise to the Oval Office. Even today, he's the single biggest spender on Facebook political ads, according to a recent study by New York University.</p><p>But last  week's gripes about Google and social media were singularly effective for Trump, abruptly changing the conversation from one of the darkest periods of his presidency - Michael Cohen's plea deal, Paul Manafort's conviction, and Trump's reaction to the death of John McCain.</p><p>Terrible timing</p><p>The timing of Trump's attacks couldn't be worse for tech firms. On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling. Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>The last time lower-level executives appeared before Congress, they were not well received, but the tech firms have a better story this time. They've been aggressively rooting out foreign interference from Russia and Iran on their platforms, working closely with each other as well as security firms, law enforcement and intelligence officials to shut down threats. And after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was taken aback by repeated allegations of conservative censorship during April congressional hearings on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, they are preparing to field those questions, too.</p><p>With one notable exception. The Senate panel invited Google parent Alphabet CEO Larry Page and offered to accept Google CEO Sundar Pichai, but Google offered Kent Walker, its senior vice president for global affairs and a point person on election interference.</p><p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr turned down Google, saying Walker isn't high-ranking enough. Google says it has no plans to send anyone else, prompting both parties to criticize the no show. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Intelligence panel's top Democrat, said Google is making a grave mistake.

Expect some pointed questions on how these companies police political speech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growing allegations that Facebook, Google and Twitter limit the reach of conservative voices and viewpoints on their platforms is the latest political crisis to engulf the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past year, censorship charges have become a conservative rallying cry, raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill. Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a  bitterly divided political climate, tech companaies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the big tech backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling.</p><p>Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>President Donald Trump claims that tech companies are biased against him.

Expect some pointed questions on how these companies police political speech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growing allegations that Facebook, Google and Twitter limit the reach of conservative voices and viewpoints on their platforms is the latest political crisis to engulf the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past year, censorship charges have become a conservative rallying cry, raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill. Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a  bitterly divided political climate, tech companaies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has met with prominent conservatives about bias.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling.</p><p>Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURLFP-bur-1993379276</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURLFP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T63-W7N1-JC3H-01B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256624</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Burlington Free Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Burlington Free Press (Vermont)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 4, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TDZ</classCode><className>US FEDERAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Expect some pointed questions on how these companies police political speech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growing allegations that Facebook, Google and Twitter limit the reach of conservative voices and viewpoints on their platforms is the latest political crisis to engulf the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past year, censorship charges have become a conservative rallying cry, raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill. Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a  bitterly divided political climate, tech companaies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has met with prominent conservatives about bias.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling.</p><p>Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CINNEN-cin-1993377041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CINNEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T63-W7N1-JC3H-0175-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255815</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Cincinnati Enquirer All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Cincinnati Enquirer (Ohio)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 4, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TDZ</classCode><className>US FEDERAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Expect some pointed questions on how these companies police political speech, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growing allegations that Facebook, Google and Twitter limit the reach of conservative voices and viewpoints on their platforms is the latest political crisis to engulf the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past year, censorship charges have become a conservative rallying cry, raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill. Now the attacks are ratcheting up, with some GOP leaders and now President Donald Trump using the hashtag #stopthebias to target left-leaning Silicon Valley ahead of the November midterm elections.</p><p>Why? It hits a bull's eye with supporters whose opinion of social media has sunk to the level of mainstream media. A new poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right. Some Republicans have started using bias claims in fundraising pitches.</p><p>\"If you're a staunch conservative Trump supporter and don't like CNN, you can switch the channel to Fox. But where do you switch the channel from Facebook or Google?\" said Dan Schnur, professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications.</p><p>\"Fake social\" and \"fake search\" is now on the tips of conservative tongues the way \"fake news\" has been for the last few years, reports Axios' Mike Allen. Donald Trump Jr. told Allen that if a  conservative alternative to Facebook existed, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it.</p><p>In such a  bitterly divided political climate, tech companaies are taking these charges seriously. Facebook hired former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to consider whether it suppresses conservative voices. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has met with prominent conservatives about bias.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>These defensive measures could help them head off threats of regulation. Last week the Trump administration raised the prospect of tightening the screws on Google as a growing number of proposals to regulate big tech make the rounds in Washington. There's not much the White House could do without the cooperation of Congress, but Trump has a knack for normalizing political ideas that were not previously part of the public discussion, political observers say.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was \"taking a look\" at whether Google searches should be monitored by the federal government. Trump seemed to walk back that threat Wednesday. \"We're just going to see,\" he said. \"You know what we want? Not regulation. Fairness.\"</p><p>But on Thursday, retiring Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into \"Google's conduct in search and digital advertising.\" The FTC ended a similar probe in 2013 before the backlash in Washington. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Last week, Trump used his Twitter bullhorn to amplify bias charges. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said Google and other companies \"silence a very large part of this country.\" As proof, Trump posted a video claiming Google plugged President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses on its home page but not his. Google denied it, backed up by screenshots showing it promoted the speech.</p><p>On Wednesday, lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will question Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a hearing focused on Russian interference in U.S. elections, almost one year after Facebook, Google and Twitter first testified before Congress on the meddling.</p><p>Separately, Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURLFP-bur-1788333583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURLFP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDY-FPD1-JC3H-04CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256624</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Burlington Free Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Burlington Free Press (Vermont)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 4, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This came after Trump accused Twitter of interfering with the election because it fact-checked his tweet[1] voicing concern that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud.The executive order[2], reportedly, 'would make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable for policing speech, suspending accounts, removing posts or passing judgment on the veracity of what users say or write.' CNN technology reporter Brian Fung[3] gave further context when he stated[4], 'The draft EO seeks to curtail the power of tech platforms by reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a critical law that shields websites and tech companies from lawsuits.'The Byers Market newsletter explained how this executive order would 'make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable' for censoring content: 'It would do so by asking the FCC to reconsider the scope of Section 230, which gives social media platforms immunity from liability for the content posted by their users. </p><p>The order argues that tech firms forfeit these protections once they interfere with users' speech. 'The order would also give the FTC the ability to investigate claims of bias by these platforms and prohibit all federal agencies from advertising on platforms that regulators deem to be non-neutral.' Big Tech leaders have sparred over this controversy during the past few days, particularly Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.Zuckerberg told Dana Perino of Fox News[5]: 'We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this. You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be, or especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' Zuckerberg made similar comments[6] to 'Squawk Box' co-host Andrew Sorkin when he explained, 'I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth.' Zuckerberg later added, 'Political speech is one of the most sensitive parts in a democracy, and people should be able to see what politicians say.'Dorsey responded to this controversy[7] by commenting[8]: 'We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.' However, recent events seem to show otherwise, as Dorsey's platform has allowed what U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center Coordinator Lea Gabrielle described as 'Russian-style disinformation techniques' from China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo\">https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo</url> to disrupt America and scapegoat its leadership on the platform.Further still, Twitter allowed other forms of Chinese government propaganda[9] to remain on the platform. Spokesperson Deputy Director General, Information Department, Foreign Ministry of China Lijian Zhao even shared an article headlined 'China's Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus Originate in the US?' and suggested[10], 'It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.'

This came after Trump accused Twitter of interfering with the election because it fact-checked his tweet[1] voicing concern that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud.The executive order[2], reportedly, 'would make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable for policing speech, suspending accounts, removing posts or passing judgment on the veracity of what users say or write.' CNN technology reporter Brian Fung[3] gave further context when he stated[4], 'The draft EO seeks to curtail the power of tech platforms by reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a critical law that shields websites and tech companies from lawsuits.'The Byers Market newsletter explained how this executive order would 'make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable' for censoring content: 'It would do so by asking the FCC to reconsider the scope of Section 230, which gives social media platforms immunity from liability for the content posted by their users. </p><p>The order argues that tech firms forfeit these protections once they interfere with users' speech. 'The order would also give the FTC the ability to investigate claims of bias by these platforms and prohibit all federal agencies from advertising on platforms that regulators deem to be non-neutral.' Big Tech leaders have sparred over this controversy during the past few days, particularly Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.Zuckerberg told Dana Perino of Fox News[5]: 'We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this. You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be, or especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' Zuckerberg made similar comments[6] to 'Squawk Box' co-host Andrew Sorkin when he explained, 'I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth.' Zuckerberg later added, 'Political speech is one of the most sensitive parts in a democracy, and people should be able to see what politicians say.'Dorsey responded to this controversy[7] by commenting[8]: 'We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.' However, recent events seem to show otherwise, as Dorsey's platform has allowed what U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center Coordinator Lea Gabrielle described as 'Russian-style disinformation techniques' from China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo\">https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo</url> to disrupt America and scapegoat its leadership on the platform.Further still, Twitter allowed other forms of Chinese government propaganda[9] to remain on the platform. Spokesperson Deputy Director General, Information Department, Foreign Ministry of China Lijian Zhao even shared an article headlined 'China's Coronavirus: A Shocking Update.

This came after Trump accused Twitter of interfering with the election because it fact-checked his tweet[1] voicing concern that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud.The executive order[2], reportedly, 'would make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable for policing speech, suspending accounts, removing posts or passing judgment on the veracity of what users say or write.' CNN technology reporter Brian Fung[3] gave further context when he stated[4], 'The draft EO seeks to curtail the power of tech platforms by reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a critical law that shields websites and tech companies from lawsuits.'The Byers Market newsletter explained how this executive order would 'make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable' for censoring content: 'It would do so by asking the FCC to reconsider the scope of Section 230, which gives social media platforms immunity from liability for the content posted by their users. </p><p>The order argues that tech firms forfeit these protections once they interfere with users' speech. 'The order would also give the FTC the ability to investigate claims of bias by these platforms and prohibit all federal agencies from advertising on platforms that regulators deem to be non-neutral.' Big Tech leaders have sparred over this controversy during the past few days, particularly Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.Zuckerberg told Dana Perino of Fox News[5]: 'We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this. You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be, or especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' Zuckerberg made similar comments[6] to 'Squawk Box' co-host Andrew Sorkin when he explained, 'I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth.' Zuckerberg later added, 'Political speech is one of the most sensitive parts in a democracy, and people should be able to see what politicians say.'Dorsey responded to this controversy[7] by commenting[8]: 'We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.' However, recent events seem to show otherwise, as Dorsey's platform has allowed what U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center Coordinator Lea Gabrielle described as 'Russian-style disinformation techniques' from China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo\">https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo</url> to disrupt America and scapegoat its leadership on the platform.Further still, Twitter allowed other forms of Chinese government propaganda[9] to remain on the platform.

This came after Trump accused Twitter of interfering with the election because it fact-checked his tweet[1] voicing concern that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud.The executive order[2], reportedly, 'would make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable for policing speech, suspending accounts, removing posts or passing judgment on the veracity of what users say or write.' CNN technology reporter Brian Fung[3] gave further context when he stated[4], 'The draft EO seeks to curtail the power of tech platforms by reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a critical law that shields websites and tech companies from lawsuits.'The Byers Market newsletter explained how this executive order would 'make it easier for federal regulators to hold social media companies liable' for censoring content: 'It would do so by asking the FCC to reconsider the scope of Section 230, which gives social media platforms immunity from liability for the content posted by their users. </p><p>The order argues that tech firms forfeit these protections once they interfere with users' speech. 'The order would also give the FTC the ability to investigate claims of bias by these platforms and prohibit all federal agencies from advertising on platforms that regulators deem to be non-neutral.' Big Tech leaders have sparred over this controversy during the past few days, particularly Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.Zuckerberg told Dana Perino of Fox News[5]: 'We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this. You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be, or especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' Zuckerberg made similar comments[6] to 'Squawk Box' co-host Andrew Sorkin when he explained, 'I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth.' Zuckerberg later added, 'Political speech is one of the most sensitive parts in a democracy, and people should be able to see what politicians say.'Dorsey responded to this controversy[7] by commenting[8]: 'We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.' However, recent events seem to show otherwise, as Dorsey's platform has allowed what U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center Coordinator Lea Gabrielle described as 'Russian-style disinformation techniques' from China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo\">https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/alexander-hall/2020/05/14/bloomberg-news-china-attacks-america-russian-style-disinfo</url> to disrupt America and scapegoat its leadership on the platform.Further still, Twitter allowed other forms of Chinese government propaganda[9] to remain on the platform. Spokesperson &amp;#38; Deputy Director General, Information Department, Foreign Ministry of China Lijian Zhao even shared an article headlined 'China's Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus Originate in the US?' and suggested[10], 'It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.'

Good to speak with you tonight. Best of luck to you as you reopen across the country as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, that is \"The Story\" of Wednesday, May 27, 2020. We'll see you back here tomorrow night. Good night, everybody. Have a good night. Tucker is up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We'll have the latest on those riots in Minneapolis last night. And yes, they were in fact riots no matter what they're telling you on the other channels, that's a fact and we have the tape.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight, we're going to state the obvious. Donald Trump tweets an awful lot. Many wish he didn't do it. He does it anyway. It's often his preferred mode of communication.</p><p>Now, whether or not it's politically wise for him to do this, Donald Trump has an absolute right as an American to express what he actually thinks, even if every other person on Earth disagrees with him.</p><p>When they used to tell you this was a free country -- and they often said that -- that's what they were talking about, the freedom of speech.</p><p>Well, sadly, it's become a much less free country recently. Power has become radically concentrated in far fewer hands that at any time in the past hundred years at least.</p><p>And the people who wield that power have no interest whatsoever in your right to say something they disagree with. In fact, they're delighted to silence you if you try.</p><p>They're not embarrassed to admit that they do this. They don't pretend anymore. Twitter, for example, now openly purge its users whose political views their executives don't like.</p><p>It's bewildering if you think about it that they're allowed to do this because like all the Big Tech companies, Twitter only exists, its CEO is only a billionaire, because Twitter enjoys key exemptions from Federal law, exemptions that you don't enjoy, and we don't enjoy here at Fox News.</p><p>It has those exemptions because Congress carved them out for the big tech companies, and that means Congress has the power to defend your free speech online. The White House does, too. And yet they've done absolutely nothing so far to help you.</p><p>Until yesterday, Twitter returned the favor by leaving the Commander-in- Chief's Twitter feed alone, and then Trump criticized mail-in voting.</p><p>The President tweeted that mail-in ballots could be, quote, \"substantially fraudulent,\" it was a factual matter that is true and we can prove it. As we told you last night, mail-in ballots have been linked to numerous cases of election fraud. People have been criminally convicted for it. So, it's really not up for debate.</p><p>But this is an election year and mail-in voting is now the central objective of the Democratic Party, and so you're not supposed to know any of that.</p><p>Yesterday, Twitter placed a so-called fact check on the President's tweet, quote, \"Trump falsely claimed that mail in ballots would lead to a rigged election,\" Twitter announced. \"Fact checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,\" end quote.</p><p>Now, again, as a factual matter, that is a lie. There's no other way to interpret it. But worse than a lie, it is a form of political censorship.</p><p>So, who decided to do this? To sensor it?</p><p>Well, Yoel Roth has the Orwellian title, Head of Site Integrity at Twitter. An irony of free zone where they don't understand that their titles alone are scary. That means, he is one of the company's censors.</p><p>And not surprisingly, Roth is a political activist and not an especially subtle one. In January 2017, Roth compared Kellyanne Conway to the Nazi propagandist, Joseph Goebbels, that same day, he referred to the President's new staff just moving into the White House as actual Nazis and a lot more. You can look up his Twitter feed if you want, assuming he hasn't pulled it down by now.</p><p>So, these are the people controlling what you're now allowed to think and say, in America. They're authoritarians. If they're willing to censor the President, they will think of nothing at all of silencing you and they don't. They gladly do it, and no one pushes back.</p><p>Traditionally, that role, the role of pushing back hard against censorship was reserved for reporters. Their job was to safeguard the First Amendment, which is designed to protect the weak, not the strong, the weak are protected by the freedom of speech and journalists are supposed to care about the weak, about the public -- their readers and viewers.</p><p>They weren't supposed to be simply thugs hired to protect the powerful, but that's what they become. Watch Don Lemon of CNN who in his defense often has no idea what he is saying try to bully Twitter into censoring ideas the authorities don't care for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Twitter wouldn't remove those tweets, and they wouldn't come on the show to talk about their decision to let this disgusting smear stand.</p><p>People have been removed from Twitter for far less outrageous behavior. Come on Jack Dorsey. Stop hiding behind the First Amendment for profit.</p><p>Stop doing it. Do the right thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Stop hiding behind the First Amendment says Don Lemon. In the annals of cable news that must be the most unintentionally hilarious line ever uttered by a script reader, as if exercising your God-given inborn right to speech and thought and conscience is somehow wrong. It's immoral.</p><p>Don Lemon demands that you stop thinking for yourself, fall in line, get on board, obey. Tow the party line or we will hurt you. That's his message.</p><p>And it's the mirror image of what journalists should be saying. The only reason we have a free press, there's only one and that's to fight back against authoritarian power structures that demand we read from approved scripts.</p><p>And now CNN is writing those scripts. It's terrifying. And all of a sudden, it's everywhere.</p><p>Throughout April and May, YouTube, part of Google took down any video that, quote, \"explicitly disputes the efficacy of global or local health authority recommended guidance.\"</p><p>If you dared to question the decrees of the politicians, some of whom are impressive and wise, many of whom are dumb and making it up as they go along. But if you criticize them, you are censored, and many were censored for doing that.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently explained why censorship isn't really bad. In fact, it saves lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: If information, if someone is spreading something that puts people at imminent risk of physical harm, then we take that down. We don't allow that on Facebook.</p><p>There are also other misinformation that may not lead to physical -- imminent risk of physical harm, but still isn't the type of stuff we want to be spreading through our system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So this month, Facebook announced that it is expanding this effort. It announced the first 20 members of its new oversight panel. That panel will help decide which ideas can be expressed in public and which ideas must be thrown into the fireplace and forgotten forever.</p><p>And you can imagine who's on the panel, it's a list of political activists and aggressive opponents of free speech. Stanford Law Professor, Pamela Carlin headlines the group.</p><p>Pamela Carlin -- look her up when you have a minute. What do you think she cares about more? Safeguarding your sacred constitutional rights or keeping Donald Trump from getting reelected in the fall? That's a rhetorical question by the way, you know the answer.</p><p>Brendan Carr is an F.C.C. Commissioner who has closely followed Facebook's censorship efforts, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Carr, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>So, the first question I'm not sure if you can answer, but it sticks in my craw to the extent I can't control myself. Why has no one done anything about creeping censorship in this country? These companies operate because Congress allows them a special exemption. Why has Congress done nothing? The White House has done nothing to stop this?</p><p>BRENDAN CARR, F.C.C. COMMISSIONER: Yes, just tonight, you may have seen there are some reports saying that President Trump is going to sign an Executive Order tomorrow, that's going to address some of these issues.</p><p>Look, since the 2016 election, the far left has popped from hoax to hoax to hoax to try to explain the loss at the ballot box. One of them is to go after online platforms for the crime in their view of being neutral in the 2016 election.</p><p>And they're committed to making sure that these online platforms are not neutral again.</p><p>As you laid out, we're seeing it at Facebook with this oversight board. We're seeing it at Twitter with them deciding to engage in political speech against the President, and so I think going forward, if these entities want to be political actors that, like you pointed out, like every other political actor, they have First Amendment rights.</p><p>Though, they shouldn't necessarily have these special bonus protections that only that set of political actors have in Section 230 that we have talked about.</p><p>CARLSON: It is so infuriating that the Congress has done nothing to protect the public from censorship that it's hard to even to express it out loud. It is really shameful in my view.</p><p>How can you have a free and fair election when opinions are being aggressively censored to favor one side?</p><p>CARR: Hey look, these aren't fact checks that are going on. This is opinion journalism at this point. They have decided -- Twitter -- to engage the President of the United States with its own partisan political viewpoint.</p><p>They have gone to Congress time and time again, and represented under oath that they don't engage in partisan political bias.</p><p>And then we see conduct like this and I think this raises another question in addition to Section 230, which we've talked about, just a regular business practice, put aside the fact they can choose to speak, however you want. You can't have it both ways.</p><p>You can't go to Congress and say, we're neutral politically, and then engage in this type of conduct. That's a type of unfair or deceptive business practice that we get a lot of other companies under a lot of scrutiny, including from the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'm just thinking that maybe someone in the Federal bureaucracy or in the Senate of the United States or the White House could make a name for themselves by saving the country from the darkness of censorship.</p><p>Do you think -- and I just want to ask again, very bluntly, can we have a fair election when all information flows through these narrow chokeholds controlled by political partisans.</p><p>CARR: Doing nothing at this point, is not an option. In my view. These companies have told us exactly what they're going to do, which is engage in partisan political activity.</p><p>You mentioned this Facebook oversight board. There is Pam Carlin on there, and a number of other political actors that have said that the 2016 election was an unacceptable political outcome.</p><p>Facebook has now tossed the keys to content moderation to this group of partisan activists ahead of 2020 election. I think it's fair for the American public to step back and say, you know, I don't know that this one group of political actors should get special benefits above and beyond the First Amendment rights that every other political actor enjoys.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's right. I think the tech companies are too powerful to have any democracy. They must be reined in, or no more democracy. I think it's -- I think it's really clear now.</p><p>Brendan, thanks so much for coming on. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>CARR: Appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in response to the censorship efforts we just told you about, earlier today, the President tweeted this quote, \"Republicans feel that social media platforms totally silence conservative voices. We will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do and failed in 2016.\"</p><p>\"We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again, just like we can't let large scale mail-in ballots to take root in our country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and theft of ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media, clean up your act now.\"</p><p>We'll see if that happens. Fox's Dana Perino just had an interview with Mark Zuckerberg, the head and founder of Facebook. She asked him to react to what the President just said. Here was Zuckerberg's response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: He says that he is thinking about regulations or perhaps shutting down social media sites. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well, I mean, look, I'd have to understand what they actually would intend to do. But in general, I think a government choosing to just censor a platform because they're worried about censorship doesn't exactly strike me as the right reflex there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The full interview of Mark Zuckerberg by Dana Perino airs tomorrow, but for now, Dana Perino joins us, solo. Great to see you, Dana. Thanks so much.</p><p>PERINO: Hi. Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you just talked to Mark Zuckerberg -- we're glad to. Was it your impression that he was concerned that the White House, the Federal Trade Commission, the Congress of the United States were ever going to do anything to prevent censorship? Does he take it seriously, do you think?</p><p>PERINO: Oh, I definitely think that they take it seriously and what I think at least for Facebook, I've never had an opportunity to interview Jack Dorsey of Twitter.</p><p>He basically -- they don't do any interviews at all. They're accountable to no one.</p><p>Zuckerberg today, I asked him a couple of things. One was specifically about Twitter's decision to make its first attempt to fact check the President on the mail-in ballot tweet.</p><p>There's hundreds of tweets, if they were going to choose one. I don't know why they chose that one because I think that their first step out of this gate, then they fell on their face because they were basically then fact checked.</p><p>So, actually free speech working pretty well. Right? Everybody going back and forth.</p><p>What Facebook has said is that they will not weigh in on political speech. Now, that is something that they instituted last fall. They've stuck to it so far. The left actually is so frustrated with Facebook, they think they are evil.</p><p>And so I think that when there is a threat about either antitrust actions by the Justice Department, or the F.T.C., or if you look at something like what the President is talking about, this Executive Order, I don't know all the details, as Mr. Carr said, it will release tomorrow.</p><p>I think that Facebook and other tech companies know that Washington is coming to get them and they're trying to figure out ways like through the Board that you just talked about where they are.</p><p>They added Mike McConnell, a former judge, who is a conservative guy, but they're definitely taking a lot of heat for this oversight board. And there's a lot of confusion too, like, well, how much will they weigh in? What is Facebook's role going to be? Is this like an entity that actually has more power than the company?</p><p>They have yet to sort of figure all of that out, but at least I think that they are trying at least to try to figure out a way to make it look like it's more neutral.</p><p>And the other thing about conservatives on Facebook in particular, I'd say the President dominates Twitter, obviously, but conservatives and especially President Trump figured out a way to best communicate on Facebook as well and that absolutely -- it ran rings around the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, that won't happen again. But let me say, so if we say something libelous on Fox News, we can be sued for it. We're responsible for what airs on this channel.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Facebook, Google and Twitter are not. They have a special exemption from Congress. They have a business advantage over every other media platform and in exchange for that, why doesn't Congress just say, okay, then you can't censor people. You can continue to have your little carve out and become billionaires on the basis of it, but you're not allowed to censor. Why is that hard?</p><p>PERINO: Right. This is the Section 230 that Commissioner Carr was just talking about as well. I know you've talked about it on this program a lot. So, I do think that there will be a debate about it coming forward, right.</p><p>So Washington is always far behind when it comes to legislating new technologies. This has been true forever.</p><p>And I think that this is true now as these companies have grown. They're trying to figure out a way to keep their companies, but also figure out a way to deal with Washington. That is not an easy thing for them to do. But at least he was willing to come on and talk about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I hope they can deal with the consequences. I mean, I'm glad in a way that the President was in effect censored because our viewers get censored all the time and nobody cares.</p><p>And now maybe people will start paying some attention to it. Dana Perino, thank you for that. Thank you for the clip. And we'll watch tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, \"Daily Briefing.\"</p><p>PERINO: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Rioters ripped through the City of Minneapolis yesterday. You may not know that because according to CNN, they weren't really rioters, they were protesters seeking political justice because that's what you do when you're mad at America. You smash a police car window.</p><p>It's insane. It's wrecking everything. But we'll show you the tape after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Rioters cut a path of destruction through Minneapolis last night after a video went viral that showed a man dying in police custody. Our Mike Tobin has the latest on that story -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: And Tucker, it is different scene out here outside of the Third Precinct in Minneapolis as we watch.</p><p>We've got a pretty thick row of police with some of the guys in riot gear at the ready. You can see you've got a Bike Patrol. They've got the pepper spray at the ready. They've been launching the pepper spray.</p><p>And here's your crowd of demonstrators off in the foreground, who have been conflicting with police.</p><p>You see all the bottles here in the foreground. These are the bottles that they've been throwing out the police. They are chanting right now, \"I can't breathe.\"</p><p>At the moment, you see the column of police and bike police backing up. I want to point out some of their gear. You see some of the tasers on their hips. Look for the orange tubes that some of the officers are carrying. Those are the teargas launchers.</p><p>As you look up at the roof of the Third Precinct, you can see -- well, you can't see that now. There's one of the flashbangs that went off. There's a flashbang coming out. Careful, Tomas.</p><p>So some of the flashbangs are being deployed primarily from the police on the rooftop. There's one aiming his teargas launcher from the rooftop.</p><p>Now, as this is all going down, there's another tear gas launcher at the ready and these police are backing up. It looks like they're trying not to conflict with the demonstrators.</p><p>There are some teargas or pepper spray at the ready. The demonstrators are advancing as the line of police are backing up.</p><p>Now this demonstration has got the attention of President Trump and the cause of it has got the attention of President Trump who tweeted, \"At my request, the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice are already well into the investigation as to the very sad and very tragic death of George Floyd.\"</p><p>It seemed for a while the President's interest in this case, the fact that the four of the police officers connected to this incident had been fired so swiftly by the Minneapolis Police Department, but as you can see, not everyone is satisfied.</p><p>They want criminal charges. They want swift justice, and frankly, they want to express a lot of anger, Tucker.</p><p>There's one of those flashbangs that went up pretty close to us here and there is some kind of a chemical irritant and there you see the pepper spray coming out from the police.</p><p>I got the pepper spray in my eyes. So, that's the scene out here. A lot of back and forth with these demonstrators and the cops.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, man, Mike, we're going to let you breathe for a minute. We're going to keep those pictures up. We're getting reports that there's looting in other parts of the city. So, I think we're going to come back to you a little bit from now.</p><p>So, as of tonight, we know that George Floyd died in police custody. The F.B.I., as you just heard has launched an investigation and when that investigation is done, we will know a lot more.</p><p>It's possible at least one police officer will be criminally charged in the case, just to guess, but it seems likely. So as of tonight, those are the facts.</p><p>Here's another fact. What happened last night in Minneapolis was not a political protest. It was a riot.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's what rioting looks like. It happened last night, and as you can see, it's happening right now. We want to be clear, we're not showing you these pictures to defend the behavior of individuals on the Minneapolis Police Department, we're not.</p><p>We're defending society itself. Rioting is the one thing you don't want. Ugly opinions, police brutality, officious birdwatchers, rude entitled ladies walking their dogs in big city parks -- all of that is bad, but none of it is nearly as bad as what you just saw.</p><p>The indiscriminate use of violence by mobs is a threat to every American of all colors and backgrounds and political beliefs.</p><p>Democracy cannot exist when people are rioting. Rioting is a form of tyranny. The strong and the violent oppress the weak and the unarmed. It is oppression.</p><p>CNN welcomes it, however, in fact encourages it. On CNN, the rioters became protesters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking overnight, protesters clashing with police in Minneapolis, calling for justice after the death of George Floyd.</p><p>I know it has been a long night there, but people want answers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Police lined the streets throwing teargas and non- lethal projectiles to disperse crowds after thousands flooded the streets, Tuesday.</p><p>OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Protesters throughout Minneapolis that descended here and in one other location last night demanding more accountability and answers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was lying and it's hard to overstate how sinister those lies are or how dangerous they are to all of us. As we're often reminded, America is a diverse country. Diverse countries only survive if the groups within them can coexist peacefully.</p><p>And thankfully, almost everybody in America wants to coexist peacefully, but news organizations like CNN do not want that. And that's why every day they work hard to fan racial resentment to make different groups distrust and hate one another.</p><p>That can't go on forever, because if it does, things will fall apart. It is very quick.</p><p>Peter Kirsanow is a U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner. He joins us tonight. Peter, thanks so much for coming on. I can certainly understand why people are upset by the tape of the man in Minneapolis dying in police custody.</p><p>But I wonder why you can't be upset by the tape and also say it's not acceptable to riot.</p><p>PETER KIRSANOW, U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSIONER: Yes, the tape itself, obviously, it appears inexcusable, indefensible, horrific conduct. And it's not unexpected that you'd see this kind of behavior mainly because to a large extent, it's been normalized over a number of years.</p><p>And in fact, we've got some irresponsible political leadership, and media folks who introduce certain elements that are not in evidence to seem to suggest that this is all stoked by racial animosity.</p><p>Now to be clear, race may have been an issue here. The cops were animated by race, but we don't have any evidence of that. An investigation hasn't even been conducted yet.</p><p>And yet, we have political actors who've already come to the conclusion that this is race based. You have the Mayor of Minneapolis, understandably, he's in a tough position. But you have to understand, again, the incendiary nature of race in this country is going to stoke flames of division. People are going to get hurt. Property is going to get damaged.</p><p>And in many cases, the people who get hurt are the very individuals who come from the neighborhood that is affected.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. So, if you cared about the country, you would say something like this seems awful. Let's wait for all the facts. If it turns out that there was a racial component to this, we're very against that, of course. Why would people intentionally stoke race hatred?</p><p>KIRSANOW: Yes, well, we see that on a regular basis because they seem to think there's a political advantage to doing so. So you had the mayor making certain comments. You had Senator Klobuchar tweet immediately that, you know, this is somehow a matter of race.</p><p>You had Vice President Biden saying that this is -- I think he used the term that it is part of systemic injustice, again, without any evidence.</p><p>An investigation may reveal that at some point, who knows? But there hasn't been an investigation done. The F.B.I. will look at it, the Civil Rights Department of Justice, my own Civil Rights Commission will probably take a look at it.</p><p>If the evidence deduces that this is a matter of race, these individuals have been discharged. They may be subject to criminal prosecution.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KIRSANOW: They're in difficult, difficult shape. But because of political opportunism, what you see are riots. We saw this with Michael Brown, Freddie Gray. People get killed. People get hurt. Billions of dollars in property damage. All to forward a political agenda, or mostly for political agenda.</p><p>There is a process that we have, due process that will adjudge this in due time. This appears to be a horrific circumstance.</p><p>I think we've got the faculties to remedy this circumstance, but not if we've got political actors who fan the flames.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. I'd love to see a five-part series in CNN. How was Ferguson today? They don't care. You know, were they made better by that? Yes. Anyway, Peter Kirsanow --</p><p>KIRSANOW: No, it wasn't.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it wasn't.</p><p>KIRSANOW: Some people follow those things, and it doesn't happen.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's totally right. But they don't care. Great to see you tonight. I'm Peter Kirsanow. Thanks.</p><p>KIRSANOW: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, there's obviously a lot going on in Minneapolis, still more than we realized. We went live to Mike Tobin. So we're going to keep those live pictures and we may well go back there for report at the end of this hour.</p><p>So increasingly, American business owners are stepping up to reclaim their livelihoods. Up next, we'll talk to a North Carolina business owner who is suing the state's governor for the right to do that. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: America's political leaders continue in many places to impose lockdown, some extreme on the public well after, long after scientific evidence has accumulated to show pretty conclusively that they don't work very well.</p><p>But politicians are in no hurry to get back to normal and give up the power they've accrued. Their livelihoods are safe, even guaranteed by taxpayers.</p><p>They're ignoring the rules they enforce themselves, and they enjoy that.</p><p>Last night on CNN, Governor Andrew Cuomo's brother, he has got a show there, shamed Americans for daring to step outside without a mask.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Nearly 100,000 Americans dead and this President is playing games over Joe Biden wearing a mask, not to mention millions of other Americans now doing the same.</p><p>How about the clowns who are ready to double down on the death toll because they want to get their party on for the holiday?</p><p>I could show you example, after example, after example of people acting like fools, not just -- you know, not having any sense for their own safety, but the safety of others.</p><p>Do you want to wear masks? No. But is it that big a deal? Not really.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, you're immoral if you don't wear a mask. The funny thing is that the weightlifting correspondent you just saw wasn't wearing a mask of his own when he was screaming at a cyclist last month, and he was infected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID WHELAN, BIKER WHO SAW CHRIS CUOMO WHO WAS SUPPOSEDLY POSITIVE WITH COVID-19 AT THE TIME: I just said, don't you have a coronavirus? Shouldn't you be quarantined? And my biggest next words were, what the hell do you know about this? What do you know about the rules? I said, you're not supposed to be out here.</p><p>Nobody had gloves on. Nobody had masks on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So weird that on TV, it is widely known that that guy wasn't wearing a mask and he had the coronavirus, kind of weird he is lecturing other people about it. Would you be able to do that or would the hypocrisy just corrode your soul to the point you could no longer speak? ask yourself.</p><p>And then there's Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Before Memorial Day, she ordered her citizens not to vacation in the Traverse City area.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): Our big fear, of course, is that Memorial Day weekend, we know lots of people love to go north.</p><p>A small spike could be really -- could put the hospital system in dire straits pretty quickly, and that's precisely why we are asking everyone to continue doing their part.</p><p>Don't descend on Traverse City from all regions of the state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, don't go to Traverse City. It's dangerous. And almost exactly the moment that Governor Whitmer was saying that, her husband was using the fact he was married to her to pressure a small business into putting the family's boat in the water ahead of the holiday.</p><p>Now, Whitmer originally denied that even happened. She lied, she called it a hoax. Then she was exposed. It was obviously real. So, now she says it was a bad joke. But it wasn't a hoax and it wasn't a joke. It was pure, repulsive hypocrisy, and the Whitmers weren't alone in committing that.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the governor's lockdown. Justice Rebecca Dallet dissented. She said, quote, \"Wisconsinites will pay the price for going outside.\" But she didn't mean it. None of them really mean it.</p><p>We know because over Memorial Day, that same person, Dallet went boating with at least four friends, not wearing a mask, not social distancing. Oh lockdown for thee, but not for me.</p><p>Since leaders won't give Americans the right spec, it falls to ordinary Americans to reclaim them.</p><p>Michael Pastelak owns Patriot Axe Throwing in Hickory, North Carolina. He is suing the governor of that state, Roy Cooper over his Executive Orders imposing a state lockdown.</p><p>Michael Pastelak joins us along with his attorney J. Heydt Philbeck. Gentlemen, welcome to the show.</p><p>Mike, let me ask you first. You have been closed, I think and because of this lockdown, why are you reopening? Why do you think that you can and should reopen?</p><p>MICHAEL PASTELAK, OWNER, AXE THROWING BUSINESS: Well, we're reopening because we've lost so much revenue that we're going to either have to close our business for good or reopen the doors and kind of face the consequences.</p><p>So that's the reason that we've kind of went forward and decided to go ahead and reopen and start trying to serve our patrons that we had.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you have no choice, I guess is what you're saying. I mean, the governor sounds like driving you out of business.</p><p>PASTELAK: Yes, sir. And that's our main issue here is that, you know, we've got a governor in North Carolina that is wanting to be the King here and we can just let that stand.</p><p>You know, I served in the United States Army for 10 years. I got two deployments to Afghanistan, and what's funny about all of this is that the government trusted me enough that they would allow me to fly a multimillion dollar aircraft with 15 people in the back, but they don't trust me enough to operate my business safely in Hickory, North Carolina.</p><p>And at the end of the day, I'm not being allowed to provide for my family and make a living.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, your business looks a lot safer than an abortion clinic which haven't been closed. So Heydt, let me ask you, on what legal grounds are you challenging this lockdown?</p><p>J. HEYDT PHILBECK, ATTORNEY: Well, Governor Cooper has issued some fairly wide range, far reaching Executive Orders.</p><p>Now, Executive Orders that legislate or make law rather than merely enforce the law are unconstitutional. And, you know, it is a fundamental precept in representational democracy that there be a separation of powers, and that the Legislative Branch be the one that make the law and the Executive Branch and here, and in this case, it is the Governor be the one to merely enforce the law.</p><p>Well, Governor Cooper's use of the emergency powers to declare a state of emergency, and there's no criteria or qualification or even definition what a state of emergency is.</p><p>So any elected governor can declare a state of emergency in their discretion arbitrarily. And it can have such wide ranging as we see in Mike's case, effects on businesses and livelihoods on people and harm people with the scope of what it can do, what a governor can do, just on their own, and then it can last indefinitely.</p><p>Only when the governor says that well, there's no longer a state of emergency with no checks on that decision can -- will it end and it's just -- the Framers never intended for any one person to have such immense power on the lives and liberties of others.</p><p>CARLSON: There's no provision in the Constitution for a god-law where some politician declares himself god and can do whatever he wants forever. So, thank you for challenging this.</p><p>Mike, thank you for coming on. An axe-throwing business has to be the coolest kind of business and so we're rooting for you. Good luck.</p><p>PASTELAK: Yes, sir. Thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>PHILBECK: Thank you. Take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Forty million Americans are out of work, thanks to the lockdown. In the midst of that, nine Republican senators are fighting to bring in even more foreign workers into this country to take scarce jobs.</p><p>We're going to name who they are and show you their pictures, because you need to see them.</p><p>Plus a \"New York Times\" columnist just melted down completely on NBC's business network. Now, it says a lot about the leadership class in this country. I have an amazing tape, we've got it for you, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... panicked about PPE, panicked about ever going out again, panicked about getting back to normal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joseph, you didn't panic about anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, good -- why not help people --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joseph, a hundred thousand people died.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: If you haven't seen NBC's business channel in a while, it's okay if you haven't, you may have no idea how far left it's gone. That seems surprising.</p><p>In fact, it's an odd direction for a network that covers financial markets. But CNBC has a new activist management and the woke fringe is where they're headed.</p><p>The man they hope will take them there is a \"New York Times\" columnist called Andrew Ross Sorkin.</p><p>Sorkin is both a shameless corporate shill and a thoroughly progressive rich guy. In other words, he's got the most predictable possible views on absolutely everything.</p><p>Last year for example, Sorkin demanded that credit card companies punish gun owners for the crime of exercising their Second Amendment rights.</p><p>Needless to say, Sorkin has also been hysterical and consistently wrong about the mass lockdowns now wrecking the country.</p><p>This morning, Sorkin had the following exchange with his CNBC co-host, Joe Kernen. In case you've never seen the show before, Sorkin is the screechy one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, CNBC ANCHOR: Go ahead with the news.</p><p>JOE KERNEN, CNBC HOST: You panicked about the market. Panicked about COVID. Panicked about the ventilators. Panicked about the PPE, panicked about ever going out again, panicked that we'd ever go back to normal.</p><p>SORKIN: Joseph, you didn't panic about anything --</p><p>KERNEN: What good is it? Why not help people ...</p><p>SORKIN: Joseph, a hundred thousand people died.</p><p>KERNEN: ... keep their head. I understand that.</p><p>SORKIN: A hundred thousand people died, Joe and all you did was try to help your friend, the President. That's what you did. Every single morning on this show, every single morning on this show.</p><p>KERNEN: It had nothing to do with that.</p><p>SORKIN: You have used and abused your position, Joe.</p><p>KERNEN: That's totally unfair and -- I'm trying to help investors keep their cool, keep their heads and as it turned out that's what they should have done.</p><p>SORKIN: You know what, Joe --</p><p>KERNEN: That was it.</p><p>SORKIN: I wasn't arguing to go sell your stocks, Joseph. I was arguing about people's lives.</p><p>KERNEN: We understand -- Andrew ...</p><p>SORKIN: People's lives.</p><p>KERNEN: Andrew, it's a global pandemic.</p><p>SORKIN: Do the news. I'm begging you to do the news, Joseph.</p><p>KERNEN: It's a ...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Watch that again online. It's a fascinating colloquy. So Kernen is frustrated by Sorkin's wrong predictions. That's understandable. Sorkin has made many of them.</p><p>So how does Sorkin respond to this? Not by defending his own positions, he can't do that. He doesn't want to. So, instead he invokes Donald Trump and then attacks Joe Kernen personally.</p><p>And then he patronizes Joe Kernen, like he's already won the argument and it's not even worth debating someone that dumb. Oh do the news, Joe, Sorkin says waving his tiny little hand, do the news.</p><p>Does that scene look familiar to you? Of course it does. Sorkin is a stand- in for every incompetent entitled lifestyle liberal, which is to say for the people who by and large run this country at every level.</p><p>Confront them with their mistakes and they attack you, and then shoo you away -- every time. No wonder nothing ever gets better.</p><p>So, thanks to the Chinese style mass quarantines, our leaders mindlessly adopted, 40 million Americans have lost their jobs. That's more unemployed than in any time in American history, and we're including the Great Depression.</p><p>This is a crisis. It's as profound and dangerous a crisis as any war we've ever fought. God help us if we don't fix it soon.</p><p>Finding work for Americans has got to be our top priority. Thankfully, there's something we can do to help right away.</p><p>A huge number of American jobs are now occupied by foreign nationals and not just the seasonal lettuce picking we hear so much about, those fabled jobs Americans just won't do.</p><p>But also many jobs that Americans would be thrilled to do and have, white- collar jobs. The kinds your kids studied for in college, but can't get because some big company would rather pay foreigners a cheaper wage.</p><p>That is happening all over this country and has been for years. It's legal because Congress made it legal through H1B visas and other guest worker programs. There are a lot of them.</p><p>If there was ever a time to end this utterly immoral outrage that hurts Americans that time is right now, when the future of the nation depends upon getting Americans back to work.</p><p>But amazingly, many in Congress disagree. Today, nine Republican senators sent a letter to the President. They demanded that he continue to allow foreigners to take American jobs.</p><p>Those senators, in order to increase their well-deserved shame, we're putting their pictures on the screen right there. Those senators are Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Cornyn of Texas, James Risch and Mike Crapo of Idaho; Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Todd Young of Indiana.</p><p>Their letter, the one they signed, calls for the President to impose no limitations at all on H2A or H2B guest visas, and instead allow foreign replacements to continue to stream into our country unimpeded and take jobs.</p><p>Now, again, this is not about migrant workers picking grapes in the Central Valley in the hot sun. The senators would like to see foreign doctors, physicians, dentists, cybersecurity experts and many other categories of white collar workers come, too.</p><p>There's certainly no shortage of Americans desperate to do these jobs. So many of our doctors and dentists, for example, aren't working right now. But don't worry, say the senators. All of the Americans are getting generous unemployment benefits.</p><p>So at this point, we want to be clear about something. Not all of these nine senators are bad people. We know and even like some of them. Lankford, for example, nice guy.</p><p>But we are fervently rooting for their defeat anyway. We are hoping that the next Republican primary, all nine of the people you're looking at right now will be defeated and replaced by people who care about unemployed Americans. That is the very least we can expect and in fact, we should demand it again and again.</p><p>Riots and looting are ripping apart Minneapolis at this hour, unexpected, uncovered but it is happening. We'll be joined by another reporter on the scene right after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a Fox News Alert. These are live pictures tonight from Minneapolis. They're from our Fox station's helicopter. They show looting happening as we speak.</p><p>Rioterse are using the death, the sad death of a man in police custody as a pretext to pillage businesses that have nothing to do with any of it in downtown Minneapolis.</p><p>A few moments ago, local Fox Minneapolis took some disturbing footage from another vantage point of the looting.</p><p>The reporter had to clear that specific area. That reporter is Karen Scullin and she joins us tonight by phone.</p><p>Karen, thanks so much for joining us. What are you seeing in Minneapolis right now?</p><p>KAREN SCULLIN, REPORTER, KSMP (via phone): Well, I can tell you, so I was just a few short of steps away covering the protest which have been going on all day at the Third Precinct, and then I heard a little bit about -- something about looting in stores.</p><p>So I started walking towards the Target store which has been closed for the day, I'm assuming because of the protest. And there were people just carrying out televisions. They were stacking them on top of their cars. Two TVs on top of cars.</p><p>Diapers, clothes, buoys, cameras -- it was coming out. At one point, it started when they smashed kind of a window by the front door and then, I guess they unlocked the door and everybody rolled in.</p><p>And if you look inside the store, it literally looked like people were simply shopping and then they would come out with carts full of goods from inside the store like it was no big deal.</p><p>This went on for a very long time. No police anywhere. Probably about I'd say 30 to 40 minutes into it. I've been tweeting about it.</p><p>A couple of Deputies rolled up, honked their horns and left and that was it, and so then, the looting continued.</p><p>And I've really never seen anything like it around here, at least in Minneapolis.</p><p>CARLSON: Were they shouting political slogans or saying they wanted answers or did they just want TVs?</p><p>SCULLIN: No. They just want to steal. No, I mean, it appears that they just were stealing. There were no political anything going on there at Target. It's just a short step away at the Third Precinct, yes, there are plenty of chants and shouting, and police were continuing to fire rubber bullets and teargas on that side of things.</p><p>So there are sort of two separate things going on at the same time.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing, amazing video. Stay safe. Karen, thanks for joining us tonight. Appreciate that.</p><p>SCULLIN: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: When we last talked to our Mike Tobin, he was having trouble breathing. He got hit with some kind of CS gas. We want to check back in with him to see how he is doing. Hey, Mike.</p><p>TOBIN: Well, I'll tell you, if you look around the area, talk about looting. This barricade that they've erected in the middle of the street is primarily made up of grocery carts from Target, garbage cans, whatever you have.</p><p>So they're chanting off in the distance and a lot of people are behind that barricade. It doesn't really have seem to have much in the way of a strategic advantage.</p><p>But there's people chanting George Floyd right now. I can tell you that some of the people out in this crowd are armed as we look over here at the police in some riot gear with the helmets, with the gas masks on.</p><p>You can also see the Third Precinct here. How broken up it is. You've got the door that's been boarded up. You've got the broken up windows. And that's our scene out here -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Unbelievable. Stay safe. Mike Tobin in Minneapolis. Good to see you. That's the America they created.</p><p>We are out of time. We will be back tomorrow. In the meantime, the Great Sean Hannity takes over, the 9:00 p.m. hour from New York.</p><p>Hey, Sean.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020052701cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-2D31-DXH2-64WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The White House action comes two days after Twitter angered Trump by adding a disclaimer to his tweets[2] falsely claiming mail-in ballots lead to widespread voter fraud. Even though the company did not delete his tweets, the president accused it of censorship. </p><p>Advertisement 'Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election,' he tweeted Wednesday night. 'If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen!'The president's order, which could still be modified before it is signed, aims to modify the scope of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that protects internet companies from liability for content posted by users.If a social media platform edits content   apart from restricting posts that are violent, obscene or harassing   'it is engaged in editorial conduct' and 'forfeits any protection' under the act, according to a draft version of the executive order that was posted online[3] by Kate Klonick, a professor at the St. John's University School of Law in New York.The executive order would direct Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to request new regulations from the Federal Communications Commission to determine when a company is acting 'in good faith' to limit content.  Advertisement  That could open the door for users to sue social media platforms if they feel their posts were restricted inappropriately. It's unclear whether such regulations would pass judicial scrutiny, and legal experts are skeptical given the wide berth given to social media companies to police their own platforms. Trump has a history of using executive orders to make political statements[4] when his authority is limited.The White House also could collect complaints about alleged online censorship and other unfair practices, then forward them to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission for possible legal action.More pressure could come in courthouses around the country. U.S. Atty. Gen. William Barr would work with state attorneys general to determine whether companies are violating any state laws. Advertisement  In addition, Trump would limit federal agencies' spending on advertising on social media platforms. It was not immediately clear how much money could be affected.Trump is a prolific user of Twitter, often tweeting or retweeting dozens of times a day. His reelection campaign uses an array of social media platforms to aggressively target voters for the November election.

For now, neither side is ready to blink.</p><p> The funding measure may only be temporary and will likely still deny the President all of the US$5 billion (S$6.8 billion) he is demanding for his wall on the Mexican border. In the weeks to come, expect more fights over the visceral issues of healthcare and immigration reform.</p><p> With a few exceptions - one of which may be bipartisan consensus on regulating big tech companies - and amid manoeuvring ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign, the stage is set for gridlock on Capitol Hill.</p><p> The Democratic Party, flexing its majority, will lay landmines for the administration in the form of inquiries and possibly subpoenas, targeting key Trump associates and Cabinet members. Mr Trump has called it \"presidential harassment\".</p><p> As the 2020 campaign looms on the horizon, America's focus is likely to be increasingly inward. Internal tensions within the Republican and Democratic parties are also set to increase.</p><p>With a few exceptions - one of which may be bipartisan consensus on regulating big tech companies - and amid manoeuvring ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign, the stage is set for gridlock on Capitol Hill.</p><p> \"It's going to become very difficult to pass any legislation unless it has overwhelming bipartisan support, and I'm afraid we could see more shutdowns as Mr Trump tries to placate his base (which is his best safeguard against any impeachment attempts),\" said one analyst on condition of anonymity, citing his organisation's rules.</p><p> Also in the pipeline is the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign, which has already unearthed enough to put former Trump aides in jail and stoke anticipation over what more is to come.</p><p> The US-based think-tank Atlantic Council ranks the Mueller probe No. 1 on a list of 10 risks it has identified for 2019, with the possibility that the nation will be plunged into a domestic political crisis.</p><p> For impeachment to succeed, 20 Republican senators would have to vote against Mr Trump. But analysts say that unless there are very credible grounds, the move could backfire. Mr Trump has called the probe a witch hunt and some analysts worry that angry Trump supporters could take to the streets. The Democratic Party itself is also split over impeachment.</p><p> \"Clear-cut proof of widespread collusion could split the Republicans,\" wrote two security experts, Dr Robert Manning and Dr Mathew Burrows, in the Atlantic Council's 2019 risk assessment.</p><p> But they warned: \"Mr Trump's impeachment could trigger a national crisis, with many of his supporters battling what they perceive to be a rigged system.\"</p><p> Other risks listed include a new nuclear arms race featuring the US, Russia, China and, to some degree, India; negotiations with North Korea turning sour; and a deepening trade war with China in case the two countries do not come to an agreement by March 1, the deadline set by Mr Trump for a deal.</p><p> Certainly, the President needs to win concessions from China for the sake of sections of his base - farmers and small businesses - which are hurting from the trade war.</p><p> A deal will also help sustain the robust economy, which many analysts are predicting is due for a slowdown. The global economy is set to slow and there are fears of a US recession.</p><p> \"In July 2018, the US economy entered the 10th year of the current economic expansion and given that it is now the second-longest in US history, many are asking how much longer it can last,\" JP Morgan said in a Nov 26 note on its website.</p><p> This month, Moody's Investors Service said \"Mr Trump's tax cuts, combined with a slowing economy, will diminish the United States' 'fiscal strength' over the next 10 years... as the federal debt burden grows and debt affordability declines\".

Any difficulty and we will assume control.\"</p><p>\"When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\" he continued.</p><p>Those last words, which echoed a refrain heard during the racially charged civil rights era in the US south, prompted a torrent of complaints, as well as Twitter's extraordinary decision to restrict public access to the tweet.</p><p>\"He is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I'm furious,\" Trump's Democratic rival in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, said.</p><p>Others homed in on what they saw as  racism in an apparent threat to have black protesters shot.</p><p>\"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November,\" tweeted pop superstar Taylor Swift.</p><p>Trump responded later Friday on Twitter with a convoluted statement suggesting that he'd been referring not to authorities shooting protesters, but to criminal shooting incidents that had already taken place on the sidelines of the unrest.</p><p>\"Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night -- or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>- War with Twitter -</p><p>Twitter's decision to hide the Trump tweet was the latest salvo in an ever-growing row between the Republican and the giant social media platform that he has turned into an integral part of his presidency, with 80 million followers.</p><p>Trump is furious that earlier this week Twitter tagged two of his tweets with fact checks, indicating that they were misleading -- another unprecedented measure.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump responded by signing an executive order in the Oval Office seeking to transform the way social media companies are regulated.</p><p>And on Friday, right after Twitter hid his \"shooting\" tweet, the official White House account thumbed its nose by reposting it.</p><p>This time, Twitter responded by saying that while the rules had been violated again, the company \"determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\"</p><p>The White House defended Trump, saying he \"clearly condemned\" violence, but his social media director and Twitter feed manager, Dan Scavino, had a more earthy response to the controversy.</p><p>\"Twitter is full of shit -- more and more people are beginning to get it,\" he wrote on Twitter.</p><p>One immediate result of the blow-up between the social media-savvy president and the high-profile company has been to knock the coronavirus pandemic and the recent milestone of 100,000 American virus deaths out of the headlines.</p><p>It also ties in with one of Trump's major reelection themes: that despite being a billionaire White House incumbent with a Republican majority in the Senate, he is an outsider fighting a left-wing establishment.</p><p>- End to self-regulation? -</p><p>Trump's executive order seeks to remove social media platforms' decades-long freedom from liability for content posted. Instead of being allowed to self-regulate, this would treat the companies more like traditional publishers, open to government regulation and court challenges over false or harmful material.</p><p>Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"We can't let this continue to happen,\" Trump said.</p><p>Ironically, his order could spur companies like Twitter to impose stricter guidelines for users, eventually curbing social media firebrands like Trump himself, who regularly goes online to insult people and support conspiracy theories.</p><p>How much will change in the near term is unclear, given the legal and political challenges facing Trump's move.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Trump fights claims he stoked violence in escalating Twitter feud </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-6HN1-DY93-M0BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>9:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the overnight tweet, Trump called the people rioting \"THUGS\" and said he'd told the state governor \"the Military is with him all the way. </p><p>Any difficulty and we will assume control.\" \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\" he continued.Those last words, which echoed a refrain heard during the racially charged civil rights era in the US south, prompted a torrent of complaints, as well as Twitter's extraordinary decision to restrict public access to the tweet. \"He is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I'm furious,\" Trump's Democratic rival in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, said. Others homed in on what they saw as racism in an apparent threat to have black protesters shot. \"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November,\" tweeted pop superstar Taylor Swift. Trump responded later Friday on Twitter with a convoluted statement suggesting that he'd been referring not to authorities shooting protesters, but to criminal shooting incidents that had already taken place on the sidelines of the unrest. President Donald Trump is on the warpath against Twitter after the platform for the first time labelled two of his tweets, on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting, with fact-check notices AFP / - \"Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night -- or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means,\" Trump tweeted.Twitter's decision to hide the Trump tweet was the latest salvo in an ever-growing row between the Republican and the giant social media platform that he has turned into an integral part of his presidency, with 80 million followers. Trump is furious that earlier this week Twitter tagged two of his tweets with fact checks, indicating that they were misleading -- another unprecedented measure. US President Donald Trump, flanked by Attorney General William Barr, prepares to sign an executive order on social media companies in the Oval Office on May, 28, 2020 AFP / Brendan Smialowski On Thursday, Trump responded by signing an executive order in the Oval Office seeking to transform the way social media companies are regulated. And on Friday, right after Twitter hid his \"shooting\" tweet, the official White House account thumbed its nose by reposting it. This time, Twitter responded by saying that while the rules had been violated again, the company \"determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\" The White House defended Trump, saying he \"clearly condemned\" violence, but his social media director and Twitter feed manager, Dan Scavino, had a more earthy response to the controversy. \"Twitter is full of shit -- more and more people are beginning to get it,\" he wrote on Twitter. One immediate result of the blow-up between the social media-savvy president and the high-profile company has been to knock the coronavirus pandemic and the recent milestone of 100,000 American virus deaths out of the headlines. It also ties in with one of Trump's major reelection themes: that despite being a billionaire White House incumbent with a Republican majority in the Senate, he is an outsider fighting a left-wing establishment.Trump's executive order seeks to remove social media platforms' decades-long freedom from liability for content posted. Instead of being allowed to self-regulate, this would treat the companies more like traditional publishers, open to government regulation and court challenges over false or harmful material. Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\" \"We can't let this continue to happen,\" Trump said. Ironically, his order could spur companies like Twitter to impose stricter guidelines for users, eventually curbing social media firebrands like Trump himself, who regularly goes online to insult people and support conspiracy theories. How much will change in the near term is unclear, given the legal and political challenges facing Trump's move. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159079357642625876100223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6017-8DJ1-JCMN-Y41T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

US President Donald Trump criticised Twitter\u2019s Trending section saying that all trends about him are bad and blown out of proportion which is ridiculous, illegal, and unfair.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2020   Trump did not cite any particular trend to back his claim but did write that the trending topics were illegal. Twitter shows topics that are current and are based on the user\u2019s search.  According to Twitter\u2019s FAQ section, \u201cTrends are determined by an algorithm and, by default, are tailored for you based on who you follow, your interests, and your location.

The feud between Trump and Twitter had been going on since the time Twitter added fact-checking labels to the US president\u2019s tweet claiming the 2020 elections will be rigged through mail-in ballots. Trump then signed an executive order in May which limits the protections of social media companies such as Twitter, Facebook, and search giant Google over the content on its platforms.  Twitter also labelled tweets in the backdrop of Minneapolis tweets when Trump had written: \u201cAny difficulty and we will assume control, but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d This infuriated Trump who then tweeted \"Revoke 230.\"  Section 230 is part of a law called the Communications Decency Act, The Independent notes. The law shields any website or service that hosts content such as news outlets' comment sections, video services like YouTube, and social media services like Facebook and Twitter from lawsuits over content posted by users.  In the latest development, The Commerce Department has asked the Federal Communications Commission to write a regulation weakening protections laid out in Section 230, as per a report by Bloomberg. This comes ahead of the antitrust investigation against the big tech companies on July 29.  \u201cTwitter is doing nothing about all of the lies &amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party.

A coronavirus aid deal isn\u2019t coming , Speaker Nancy Pelosi conceded Thursday. House Democrats couldn\u2019t surmount their impasse with the White House after Pelosi\u2019s negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underscored the substantial daylight between both sides. The House passed Democrats\u2019 $2.2 trillion plan on a largely symbolic and party-line vote last night, but members will head back to their districts without a deal to tout to voters they\u2019re telling to reelect them, as POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Ferris, Melanie Zanona and Heather Caygle report .             That forces California into the kind of fiscal pain this year\u2019s budget hoped to avoid. The deal Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders struck delayed some $11 billion worth of reductions and deferrals, making those cutbacks contingent on getting federal aid by Oct. 15. It now looks exceedingly unlikely those funds will arrive in California\u2019s accounts in two weeks. POLITICO\u2019s Katy Murphy has detailed how that would hit courts, higher education, state workers and others.   While Newsom has publicly projected optimism about reinforcements arriving, many California Democrats are resigned to waiting for a new president . When you see California Democrats campaigning and raising money for Joe Biden, remember that it isn\u2019t just about the Supreme Court or health care or the environment. It also involves a basic dollars-and-cents calculus. In this view, stabilizing California\u2019s economy \u2014 and forestalling an avalanche of evictions and foreclosures next year \u2014 depends to a great extent on who\u2019s in the White House.   BUENOS D\u00cdAS, good Friday morning. BREAKING LAST NIGHT:  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19 . \u201cWe will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter . \u201cWe will get through this TOGETHER!\u201c In other coronavirus news, an appeals panel on Thursday declined to halt California\u2019s pandemic-related restrictions on religious gatherings. While the U.S. Supreme Court has already backed Newsom on this issue in May, that was a 5-4 ruling \u2014 and a Justice Amy Coney Barrett could tip the balance if this goes back to SCOTUS.   QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cYou cannot get closer to total disobedience of any kind of law. What\u2019s happening up here is full-on anarchy.\u201d Shasta County Executive Officer Matt Pontes on coronavirus defiance, via Bloomberg\u2019s Michael Lewis .   TWEET OF THE DAY: Oakland Mayor @LibbySchaaf after President Donald Trump again bashed Oakland, this time during Tuesday\u2019s debate: \u201cDon\u2019t want to hear our beloved town\u2019s name come from his foul and ignorant mouth again? #Vote\u201d   BONUS TOTD: Former state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n @kdeleon responding to former California Gov. Pete Wilson's endorsement of President Donald Trump : \"Why isn\u2019t this shocking?

White: \u201cStill, the party has lots of work to do. There are still fewer registered Republicans than there were between 2000 and 2012, although the party is rebounding from its 2016 nadir. \u2026 Democrats saw the largest overall gains since last cycle, adding some 1.6 million registered voters. Their edge over Republicans increased by some 1.3 million voters between 2016 and 2020.   \u201cAnd the numbers could indicate a negative development for Republicans: more no-party-preference voters registering as Democrats . While Republican's share of the electorate remained stable from 2018 to 2020, Democrats expanded their share as the proportion of party-less voters declined. \u2026 There are now 21.2 million registered voters, which is 84.7 percent of the eligible voter pool \u2014 the highest share in the last 68 years. It's also some 3 million more registered voters than in 2016.\u201d   GUILFOYLE ALLEGATIONS \u2014 \u201c The secret history of Kimberly Guilfoyle\u2019s departure from Fox ,\u201d by the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer: An assistant to the former San Francisco first lady alleged \u201cshe was frequently required to work at Guilfoyle\u2019s New York apartment while the Fox host displayed herself naked, and was shown photographs of the genitalia of men with whom Guilfoyle had had sexual relations.\u201d   \u2014 \u201c \u2018It\u2019s Not Real Justice\u2019: Vallejo Officer Fired, But Not For Deadly Force ,\u201d by KQED\u2019s Ericka Cruz Guevarra.

FIRE IMPACT \u2014 \u201c Santa Cruz County lost almost 1,000 homes to the CZU fires. Its housing crisis is now worse than ever ,\u201d by the SF Chronicle\u2019s Mallory Moench.    CORONAVIRUS UPDATES    CHURCH CLOSURES \u2014 \u201c Appeals court swats request to pull California's restrictions on religious gatherings ,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Jeremy B. White: \u201cA majority of the panel noted that congregate activities like going to movie theaters, attending concerts and watching sporting events have also been curtailed or prohibited. The court also backed California\u2019s argument that transmission risk \u2018is elevated in indoor congregate activities, including in-person worship services.\u2019\u201d   NOT SO AMUSED \u2014 \u201c Disneyland\u2019s push to reopen sets up critical moment in California\u2019s coronavirus fight ,\u201d by the LA Times\u2019 Soumya Karlamangla, Phil Willon and Stephanie Lai: \u201cThe Walt Disney Co., one of the world\u2019s largest entertainment companies, partially blamed California\u2019s strict reopening rules for massive layoffs in its theme park division after trying unsuccessfully to get officials to allow the gates of Disneyland to swing open again.\u201d   HE'S OUT \u2014 \u201c Disney chairman quits Gavin Newsom\u2019s economic task force as company announces layoffs ,\" by the Sac Bee's Sophia Bollag: \"The spokesperson would not say why or precisely when Iger left the task force, but the news comes as the Newsom administration is preparing to release guidance on theme park reopening that the industry is criticizing.\"   \u2014 \u201c Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine study to be the third massive trial to reach San Diego ,\u201d by the San Diego Union-Tribune\u2019s Jonathan Wosen: \u201cLocal researchers aim to enroll 3,000 to 3,500 San Diegans.

DEBATE FALLOUT \u2014 \u201c \u2018Are we going to choose white supremacy?\u2019 Voters of color react to Trump\u2019s comments ,\u201d by the LA Times\u2019 Jenny Jarvie and Brittny Mejia: \u201cTrump\u2019s inflammatory performance on Tuesday and his reluctance to distance himself from right-wing extremists caused shock waves across the nation and social media, provoking a flurry of tweets from NBA stars and rappers, civil right activists and political pundits, as well as actors and actresses.\u201d    CAMPAIGN MODE    FIRST IN PLAYBOOK \u2014 ZUCK\u2019S BUCKS: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan ,  is channeling some final millions into ballot initiatives: another $4.5 billion to Proposition 15, which would raise commercial property taxes, and against Proposition 20, which would roll back sentencing and parole changes, in addition to local housing measures. The initiative\u2019s Mike Troncoso said in a statement that the measures would have \u201clong-term impacts for criminal justice reform, affordable housing policy, and especially for communities of color.\u201d   GIG FIGHT \u2014 The labor-backed campaign to beat back Proposition 22, which would exempt app-based companies from reclassifying their workers as employees, is out with its first statewide television spot.

HISTORY LESSON \u2014 \u201c California was a free state. But there was still slavery.

What does it mean for jobs? \u201d by the Sac Bee\u2019s Jeong Park: \u201cEven as the number of clean energy jobs rises in California, the quality of those positions vary wildly, from rooftop solar installers making just above minimum wage to those working in utilities making $50 an hour.

A message from DoorDash:     The pain of the pandemic has been acutely felt by local, independent restaurants\u2014putting many of them in danger of closing permanently. Without assistance, many of the more than 15M people who work at local restaurants could lose their jobs, in addition to the elimination of critical food options in some communities. At DoorDash, we have a responsibility to help our restaurant partners make it to the other side. That is why we have launched several programs, such as Main Street Strong, to support local restaurants across the country. Our COVID relief efforts have helped restaurants save $120M since mid-March, and restaurants on DoorDash have 6x better odds of staying open during COVID-19. Please visit our Merchant Impact page to hear from our local partners and see what DoorDash is doing to support jobs, the economy, and our local communities. <url normalizedValue=\"https://get.doordash.com/merchantimpact\">https://get.doordash.com/merchantimpact</url>CALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.

She is  expected to name her vice presidential pick today at an event in Florida. </p><p>On to the business world, a massive headache for General Motors to report.

All of those stories coming up this  hour, and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell.</p><p>Maverick PAC National Co-Chair Morgan Ortagus and Heritage Foundation,  Distinguished Visiting Fellow Steve Moore.  Good to see everybody -- </p><p>STEVE MOORE, ECONOMIST:  Hi, Maria -- </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, thanks for joining the conversation.</p><p>MOORE:  My pleasure -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your takeaway --   </p><p>MOORE:  You know, he shoots, he scores.  Didn't you say -- sports metaphor.   I think, the most important thing, I mean, there's a lot to talk about.</p><p>He was presidential.  And you know, that was the essential threshold.  Can  people imagine this man in the Oval Office in the White House, and the  answer is yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll talk more about that.  Lot to talk about on the  heels of the excitement last night.</p><p>Join us this hour.  Coming up, New York Congressman Lee Zeldin is with us,  retired United States Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni is with us.</p><p>Billionaire investor and co-founder of Paul Mitchell, John Paul DeJoria,  and comedian Joe Piscopo also weighing in.</p><p>All of that coming up.  Meanwhile, Donald Trump accepting the Republican  nomination last night with a historic address to the crowd.</p><p>Blake Burman is live in the Quicken Loans Arena right now with all the  highlights.  Blake, good morning. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there, Maria, good morning to you again. </p><p>Some 401 days after Donald Trump famously came down that escalator in Trump  Tower to announce his presidential candidacy.</p><p>He finally had the stage all to himself here as the Republican nominee for  president last night at the Republican National Convention.</p><p>He was introduced by his daughter Ivanka.  He gave a speech that lasted an  hour and 15 minutes long, and he really broke this down into four different  topics: trade, immigration, security, and Hillary Clinton. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty  pledge.</p><p>It reads, \"I am with her\".  I choose to recite a different pledge.  My  pledge reads, \"I am with you the American people.\"</p><p>(CHEERS) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Drew applause here in the arena, but the Clinton campaign shortly  after jumped all over that, they sent out this tweet, take a look out from  Hillary Clinton's account quoting Trump's \"I am with you\".</p><p>But they also added to it, not included women, African-Americans, LGBT  people, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants...\" </p><p>Meantime, Hillary Clinton will have her moment, so too will the Democrats  next week in Philadelphia as their convention gets underway, starting on  Monday. </p><p>Though the preparations are already under way in Philadelphia.  Of course,  the big question today going forward for Hillary Clinton, we believe today  or possibility even tomorrow, she will announce her vice presidential  running mate.</p><p>Here though in Cleveland, they are taking the stage down, but the Trump- Pence banner still very much up and alive here -- Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you Blake Burman.  Last night, Donald  Trump refocused on national security and what he believers needs to be done  to protect America.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal  immigration, to stop the gangs, and the violence and to stop the drugs from  pouring into our communities. </p><p>We must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been  compromised by terrorism. </p><p>We will also be a country of law and order.  The attacks on our police and  the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we want to right now bring in Congressman Lee Zeldin  and General Anthony Zinni to talk more about what we heard last night. </p><p>Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us, General. </p><p>ANTHONY ZINNI, RETIRED UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS GENERAL &amp; FORMER  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, UNITED STATES CENTRAL COMMAND:  Great to be with you,  Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, Congressman as well -- </p><p>REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK:  Good to see you, too -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your takeaway from the night? </p><p>ZELDIN:  I thought Donald Trump gave a great speech, Ivanka gave a great  speech, the entire night.</p><p>The left is trying to talk about the entire convention about how it was  four days of dysfunction.  The last thing they want to talk about is how  well so much of this convention went.</p><p>How well the city of Cleveland did, but also you know, the fact is if you  listen to Ivanka's words, if you listen to some of Mr. </p><p>Trump's words, he's not just talking to the people who are supporting him  already, he is reaching so far beyond that base on the issues that people  care about the most.  While the Democrats are trying to change the story to  issues that they're more comfortable with.</p><p>Donald Trump is talking national security, economic growth -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>ZELDIN:  That's what the independents -- the blanks, that's what they want  to talk about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And General, really that was the bulk  of the speech, right?</p><p>Whether it's law and order or fighting ISIS and foreign policy.  What was  your takeaway from the night, sir? </p><p>ZINNI:  Well, I thought there were several interesting points in the  speech, and they didn't get much attention I think.</p><p>One was, he said, we would stop this nation-building, and that's really  been consuming our military ever since 9/11. </p><p>So, that was an interesting policy statement.  Obviously, made mention  about rebuilding the military, also he alluded to NATO, and the concern  there about burden sharing, and paying a fair share and support.</p><p>Obviously, NATO is increasing in size but decreasing in capability, and  we're picking up about 75 percent of the military cost. </p><p>So, what I read into a lot of that is a relook at where our commitments  are, building the kind of military we need, and looking hard at the  missions we gave our military and adjusting those to something more  realistic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and General, I mean, look, you're a retired United States  Marine Corps General.</p><p>I mean, you know, the NATO comments have really been debated, and I'm glad  you brought that up because I wonder what you think of what Trump has been  saying about NATO. </p><p>ZINNI:  Well, I think NATO needs to -- we need to look hard at NATO,  obviously, it's an important alliance.</p><p>We increased it since the end of the cold war by a dozen nations, and  intend to add more.  But we've increased in size, increased in commitment,  but decreased in military capability.  And then increased our own  proportionate share that we have to pay for this. </p><p>I do think we need to get a stronger commitment from NATO to support as a  percentage of GNP, their militaries to share the burden when we are  committed. </p><p>To take positions that where political will to support and commit their  militaries is there. </p><p>So, I think, you know, NATO is important, I support NATO, but I think it's  fair to take a hard look at it, and to look at how we bring it into the  threats that we face now. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your wake on that? Do you think Trump supports NATO?  That's really the question, right? </p><p>ZELDIN:  I think his speech last night was indicating that he wants to get  to a situation where there is a strong relationship with our allies that  NATO is working for the United States, not just working for other countries  who are members of NATO.</p><p>And I think that, you know, there are just general principles of that, you  know, Mr. Trump is showing that there's clear contrast with Hillary  Clinton. </p><p>And strengthen our relationship with our allies, treating our enemies as  our enemies or critically important to keep ourselves a safe, secure and  free.  </p><p>So, the way NATO is functioning already, he notices it needs to evolve in  order for it to work better for America. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, you wanted to hear more on the economy.  You wanted to  hear more about job creation. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, you know, it's interesting though, it appears there was a  last minute shift, you know, towards the issue of safety and security.</p><p>Yes, and maybe that was to attract -- because that's something, you know,  women care very much about. </p><p>I thought what was interesting about the speech last night, I love your  reaction to this, was, you know, I remember when we went over -- I went  over to Mr. Trump, and met with the house Republicans. </p><p>And you know, the party was not unified at that time, Maria.  I mean, there  was -- there were some never Trumpers in that room. </p><p>And I wonder if you think with what happened last night, you're going to  have a unified Congress, Republican Congress behind Trump.  Does this  silence some of those never Trumpers in your caucus?</p><p>ZELDIN:  Yes, since this primary has ended, every single day, week, that's  gone by, Mr. Trump is unifying more and more of the party. </p><p>The fact is come November 8th, there will still be some Republicans who  won't be supportive of Mr. Trump. </p><p>And come November 8th, there will still be some Democrats who won't be  supportive of Hillary Clinton.  But I think this convention certainly helps  the cause of uniting the Republican Party.</p><p>And I think even what happened with Senator Cruz the night before, even  that helps uniting the Republican Party when you see Cruz delegates -- </p><p>MOORE:  Yes -- </p><p>ZELDIN:  Support him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are mad -- </p><p>MOORE:  I think -- let me -- just one question -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are mad about that, right -- </p><p>MOORE:  I think you're going to see some Republicans now want to ride on  Donald Trump's coattails especially in these blue states. </p><p>ZELDIN:  He is -- he is reaching out -- I mean, he has gone so far beyond  his base, just -- </p><p>MOORE:  Right -- </p><p>ZELDIN:  Take the last two speeches of yesterday. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes --  </p><p>ZELDIN:  On so many fronts, you couldn't think of 25, 30 different ways  that he's reaching beyond his base. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes, in the Rust Belt particularly, Steve,  is what -- </p><p>MOORE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're talking about --  </p><p>MOORE:  Exactly. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In those arm union heavy states where manufacturing jobs have  been lost.  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania -- </p><p>MOORE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ohio, and then Michigan.  Again if Donald Trump can win those  four and keep the Romney states, he gets 270 electoral college votes -- </p><p>MOORE:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, I mean, he was obviously tough on ISIS, was it the  right message? </p><p>Do you agree with that? What do we need to hear in terms of substance and  policy when it comes to defeating ISIS? </p><p>ZINNI:  Well, I do -- with what he said.  I mean, for quite a while, I have  said, we need to take on ISIS.</p><p>We've been trying to run a two-year program of our strategy of attrition,  it's been too slow, it's allowed ISIS to control terrain, it's allowed them  to be able to fund their global war against us through what they are able  to extort. </p><p>Smuggle oil, rob banks and inspire others around the world to conduct these  horrible acts.  We have the capability to take it out.  Go back to -- take  them out, go back to NATO. </p><p>How many NATO countries have been attacked by ISIS? I mean, the French, the  Belgians, us, and Germans and others. </p><p>NATO should be taking on ISIS directly.  We're so afraid of committing  ground forces, we could end this thing in a short time.  We're going to  take more civilian casualties than we would ever take in a mission to wipe  them out.</p><p>And I think that our allies in the region, in the Middle East would join  that if they knew NATO was committed to it.  Why haven't we invoked Article  V to commit the forces to once and for all destroy ISIS? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what do you think in terms of a bump post this convention?  Do you think Trump gets a bump? </p><p>Everybody after that --   </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, and I mean, look -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MOORE:  At the overnight polls, 57 percent were very impressed with the  speech -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MOORE:  Fifty seven percent, that's a giant number. </p><p>ZELDIN:  Yes, and enthusiasm gap -- </p><p>MOORE:  Yes -- </p><p>ZELDIN:  And the people are so much more excited to support Donald Trump  than those who are supporting Hillary Clinton. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, but Dagen, the critics were out strong last night. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, heavy Democratic presence, heavy liberal presence on  Twitter, but -- </p><p>MOORE:  What were they saying? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, they were just going after the alone comment -- </p><p>MOORE:  Right -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  With -- </p><p>MOORE:  Right -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The one comment that he made -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they said it was a dire speech, think that --</p><p>MOORE:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  America is dire.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly, but next week, does Hillary help herself and get  a bump because again she's got a long way to go, it appears as if she's not  lying. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we will leave it there.  Congressman Lee  Zeldin, good to see you -- </p><p>ZELDIN:  Thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sir. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Anthony Zinni, thank you so much for joining us, sir,  we will see you soon. </p><p>ZELDIN:  Sure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it.  Coming up, one major automaker in the midst of  a major recall.  Why GM is pulling more than 4 million cars off the market,  that's next. </p><p>And Facebook reaching for the skies behind the social media giant's drone  project that aims to bring internet to the masses.</p><p>Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Russian fighter jets targeting a Syrian outpost  used by the U.S. military. </p><p>Cheryl Casone is at New York headquarters right now with the story and  other headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  That's right, Maria, good morning.  Well,  alert sirens went off at the Pentagon last month after U.S. officials say  the base near the Jordanian border which is used by American and British  Special Forces was hit by missile fire. </p><p>Turns out the outpost was bombed by Russian war planes.  After the first  strike, the U.S. military reached out to the Russian air campaign  headquarters in Syria, saying the base should not be attacked. </p><p>But Russian jets hit it again about 90 minutes later.  Four Syrian rebel  troops were killed in the airstrikes, British troops had left the base just  the day before. </p><p>Well, General Motors may have to recall millions more vehicles because of  defective Takata Airbags. </p><p>GM says that federal regulators may force it to recall 4.3 million more  vehicles and an additional cost of $550 million. </p><p>In May, GM recalled almost 2 million vehicles because of the airbag  problem, and expanded the recall to another 600,000 just last month. </p><p>Well, promotions for, well, free Burritos and other food apparently didn't  do much to help Chipotle's bottom line in the second quarter following a  series of food safety problems.</p><p>Earnings falling more than 80 percent from a year ago, as same-store sales  slid nearly 24 percent.</p><p>But that's an improvement from the first quarter.  Chipotle saying it  doesn't know how long it's going to take to recover from an E. coli  outbreak and Norovirus cases that happened last Fall. </p><p>Shares by the way falling 2 percent of pre-market trading, the stock is  down 38 percent so far this year. </p><p>It's up 418.07 as of last night, stock to watch today for sure.  And  Facebook, Aquila drone has completed its first test flight in the Arizona  desert. </p><p>The solar-powered drone which has a wing span of a Boeing 737 -- there's  Mark Zuckerberg celebrating with -- and at the runaway at a military  installation near the California border yesterday. </p><p>The drone was airborne for about 90 minutes, more than three times longer  than Facebook had planned. </p><p>So, the plan, Maria, is to use the drones to deliver high-speed internet to  remote areas in the world.</p><p>But as you can see, a lot of hoot and hollering yesterday from of all  people Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>Might have been the happiest I've seen that guy in several years.  Back to  you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  All eyes on Hillary Clinton now,  she's geared up to announce her running mate today. </p><p>We are breaking down the vice presidential shortlist straight ahead.  Then  it's been an eventful week here in Cleveland, to say the least.</p><p>We will bring you the best moments from our special coverage of the  Republican National Convention on the other side of this break, stay with  us.</p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  What an incredible week for our show here in  Cleveland, here are some of the highlights of our great guests this week.   Take a look. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RICK PERRY, FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR:  This is a contest, and I understand  contests, I'm a competitor, but at the end of the day if you don't make it  to the finals, then you know, pull for your team. </p><p>And so, here is the simplicity, the way I put it.  You are either for  Donald Trump or for Hillary Clinton. </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Some of the other candidates have  not come on board, endorsed Donald Trump, even though they said and  promised and pledged on national television they would. </p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR:  Well, look, Donald Trump  wasn't my first choice, but -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Wasn't mine either -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  But a lot of -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes, governor, how -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And beyond -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Funny how that works.</p><p>BARBOUR:  Life is a series of choices -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  And if the choice of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, I'm for  Donald Trump every time. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One or two-party system, people must be grown-ups, and  say well, maybe this fellow wasn't my first choice, he is the party's  choice, I will support him. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think Donald Trump can beat Hillary Clinton? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not a question about the beat, you know, I'm  tired, if it was a corrupt -- dealing with a corrupt system, Hillary  Clinton would be the establishment. </p><p>Thus, you can understand, she can do better than anybody else in a corrupt  system. </p><p>But we don't want a corrupt system.  We want -- we will create a whole new  system.  We will tear this system apart, we want to make America great  again. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hillary Clinton either broke the law or exercised bad  judgment.  How much of a referendum do you think this is going to be on  Hillary Clinton? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, I think it's very important.  But the number that struck me  is even more powerful. </p><p>In every poll since Comey has said the FBI wasn't going to recommend an  indictment.  In every poll, a majority of Americans have said they thought  she ought to be indicted. </p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CHAIRPERSON, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:   Well, it's not surprising that the Republican National Convention stage  would use this as an opportunity to deflect from the fact that they are  about to nominate on Thursday the most divisive, bigoted, unprepared and  temperate candidate that any major party has ever put forward. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How will Trump do differently?  </p><p>DAVID CLARKE, SHERIFF, MILWAUKEE COUNTY:  What I need out of Donald Trump  is for him to appoint an Attorney General who is going to see local law  enforcement once again like we've always been as an ally in the pursuit of  criminals and of crime and start literally working together.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Trump is an outsider.  He is somebody who has created  jobs, who has given back to the people, and he's got an amazing family, his  children love him to death.  He's a good dude. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's such a binary election, and it's so clear now who  our candidate is and the direction he's taken us in compared to a  continuation of the Obama legacy on the other side, I'm optimistic. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the good news is I've asked both of my donors to come on  board with him, so -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, we need a serious donor -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're in a political convention, I want stability, I  want people to believe in economic growth, I want people that realize  America has a responsibility around the world that we have to exercise it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they not see -- like connect the dots in terms of what the  cost has done to business?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The liberals really believe, you know, just have the  government do it, things are going to go better.  And it's going to -- it's  not going to cost anybody any money.</p><p>We're going to be able to cover everybody, we're going to be able to over  regulate.  The truth of the matter is, it's just going to bankrupt the  system. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Government is inefficient by its very nature.  Let  businesses do what they can do.  And if they are inefficient, they fail and  go away. </p><p>There's a problem with government, it never goes away when it fails.  It's  always a predatory device in our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Got to ask you about your sneakers.

Once again, here's Maria Bartiromo. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, July 22nd, and we're coming to you live from the  Republican National Convention here in Cleveland, Ohio.  Your top stories  right now, 8:30 AM on the East Coast, it is official, Donald Trump formally  accepting the Republican Party's nomination for president of the United  States.  Trump's daughter, Ivanka, introducing him last night, praising her  father for his leadership.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>IVANKA TRUMP:  Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made  it a practice at his companies throughout his entire career.  He will fight  for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this, too, right  alongside of him. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland.  Hillary  Clinton looking to make waves ahead of the Democratic Convention next week,  expecting to name her vice-president pick at an event today in Florida.   Pandora, reportedly turn down a take-over bid, the decision that's weighing  on the stock ahead of the open of Pandora.  Turning to the markets, futures  indicating a higher opening for stock prices today, after stocks snapped a  nine trading day winning streak yesterday.  Investors are looking ahead to  next week Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday.  </p><p>In Europe, markets are searching for direction.  Investors watching  manufacturing data out of the Euro Zone, with the purchasing manager's  index is coming in slightly above expectation, although the purchasing  manager's index in the U.K. was lower than estimates.  In Asia, overnight,  markets were lower led by japan, the Nikkei Average down better than 1  percent.  And we're taking a look at Hillary Clinton hitting the campaign  trail in Florida, today, possibly announcing her running mate ahead of the  Democratic National Convention next week.  Adam Shapiro, right now in  Tampa, Florida, with the details.   Adam, over to you. </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  And a good morning to you, Maria.   That's right Hillary Clinton will be first in Orlando, this morning, for  what's called a round table discussion.  And then, this afternoon here in  Tampa where, Fox News has learned that there are still potentially three  candidates on her short list for vice-presidential candidates, but they  haven't said if that announcement will come at 4:30 here in Tampa, when she  speaks, although the betting money is, yes, it will.  Let's talk about the  three candidates who are believed to be on at that list, first is Senator  Tim Kaine, the former governor of Virginia, he's 58 years old.  He's  supposed to be in Massachusetts today raising money.  So, he's supposed to  be at a fundraiser.  Then you've got Tom Vilsack, he's the 65 years old  deputy secretary of agriculture, a two-term governor of Iowa.  He's in  Missouri today.  He is supposed to be in an agriculture event.  He could be  very easily gets to Tampa from Missouri.  And then, there's Cory Booker,  the senator from New Jersey who was the mayor of Newark, but replaced  Senator Lautenburg after he died, and is now the senator again from New  Jersey, 47 years old.  The problem for Mrs. Clinton is none of these  candidates appeal to the Bernie Sanders progressives, even Booker who once  said quote, there's nothing in that realm of progressive politics where you  won't found me.  Faces the problem that in 2012, he was defending Wall  Street and Bain Capital, so the liberals within the Democratic Party might  acctually attack any one of these three choices.  In the case of Mr. Kaine,  he has supported the kinds of the things for the environment, for instance,  off shore drilling and opening up the Atlantic to drilling that you would  have liberals opposed to.  So, this is going to be a very sticky situation  for Clinton here in hot and humid Tampa, but we're here to watch it, back  to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam, thank you so much.  Adam Shapiro in Florida  this morning.  Donald Trump hitting some of the key policy themes in his  acceptance speech last night, national security, foreign affairs and the  economy, particularly, trade. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I pledge to never sign any trade  agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and our  independence.  We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America, first  again.  America first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in billionaire investor and Paul Mitchell co- founder, John Paul DeJoria.  John, good to see you, thanks for joining us,  sir.  </p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, PAUL MITCHELL CO-FOUNDER:  Oh, you're very, very  welcome.  So nice to be here, quite an exciting night last night. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really was.  What was your take away? </p><p>DEJORIA  Well, not being a big fan of Donald Trump's because of his  demeanor during, of course, the primaries.  That speech last night was a  great speech, a really great speech.  You know a couple of things that are  very important for the American public to know, and hopefully will follow  through with them.  One, allow those bills that were past were never read,  for example, Obamacare, very few people read it.  When he talks about  bringing jobs back to Americans, will he look at some of these trade  agreements?  I know that some of these things can easily be done to bring  American jobs back.  Example, at Paul Mitchell, the majority of all our  liquid hair care products is made in the United States of America.  We  could have save money by going abroad, but figured out ways to be able to  do it economically enough for we can make it in the United States and pay  American workers, so obviously we'll be our customers also at the same  time.  </p><p>So, there's a lot of really, really good things that I liked, and another  thing too that was interesting and not a lot of people are talking about  it, is towards the end he talked about Bernie Sanders didn't have a chance.   Now, whether you agree with Bernie Sanders's politics or not, he is a good  man, he was very, very honest.  But, he talked about business as usual.  It  was very upsetting for a lot of people this last few years, for example,  they wanted to put on all the -- all the packaging, no GMO's, or GMO's in  my product, you know, genetic modified, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>DEJORIA . ingredients.  But yet it was stopped in congress.  So, wait a  minute, how can this be stopped in congress and the senate when it's good  for all people?   Well, maybe there're some people that make money by not  putting no GMO's on there.  So, he had a very good point there, there's a  lot of influence going on that should not be going on in our politics which  should be good for our economy and our people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm bringing in the panel, because I'm trying to figure out,  you guys, all week where business is.  Is business with Trump or not. And  it feels like small and midcap business like Paul's company is with Trump,  but the larger multinationals, the globalists.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  I agree with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . are very upset with him. </p><p>MOORE:  And I think that Donald Trump needs to make the case that he's  better for the economy, he's better for investors.  I wonder if John, you  know, does the charge that he's a trade protectionist, and by the way, he  did not use the term tariffs last night. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No. </p><p>MOORE:  And I believed he talk about tariffs.  But, John, does that concern  you?  Because I know with a lot of your colleagues in the business  community, there's a concerns that, you know, that there would be a  shutdown in trade.  I didn't hear that last night.  What about you? </p><p>DEJORIA  No, I didn't hear it at all last night, and there won't be a  shutdown in trade because both sides still benefit no matter who you're  doing business with.  They still benefit.   MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>DEJORIA  But, I think what scares some of the bigger businesses, and again,  with all due respect, is he's saying it's not going to be business as  usual.  And with all due respect, our government does give a lot of grants  to a lot of big companies that make a lot of money.</p><p>MOORE:  You got that right.</p><p>DEJORIA . that shouldn't really be getting those grants.  So, with all due  respect here, again, with all due respect, it still who are we going to  vote for.  I saw Sarah Palin do the greatest speech in the world about  eight years ago.  I went to both conventions.  I thought, wow, is that a  powerful lady, and of course, months later it wasn't quite the same.  So,  let's see how it rolls out.  But he hits some very good points that are  real.  Point's politicians were not hit because it affects some of their  big donors.  And I've got to give them credit with all the respect, no  matter what I think of the man's demeanor, he did it last night. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  John Paul -- JP, its Dagen McDowell,  in terms of what else do you need to hear from him, was there anything that  also upset you last night that you heard? </p><p>DEJORIA  I think what I'd like to hear from him would be the best way to  put it is, what are some of the guarantees and how is he going to do it?   With all due respect, how are you going to do it?  And first, you were  going to build that wall and have Mexico pay for it, well, that's not going  to happen.  I don't think Mexico is going to pay for a wall.  Though we  have a lot of great things that you said, a lot of good things, but exactly  how are you going to do it?  That's what I'd love to hear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>DEJORIA  How are you going to do it?  We in business say, we're going to do  this, we're going to market this, but here's how we're going to do it, and  then we go forth with our plans.  Donald, how are you going to do it buddy? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  And you hope she have paid that we get more substance in  this next couple of months.  I don't know.  Meanwhile, another top name in  business, the co-founder of PayPal, technology billionaire, Peter Thiel,  one of the speakers, and he spoke last night and touch from the progress of  the technology industry, but highlighted the issues that remained for  communities across the country.  Listen to this.  I'd like to get your  reaction, JP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PETER THIEL, PAYPAL CO-FOUNDER:  When I work in Silicon Valley, it's hard  to see where America has gone wrong.  My industry has made a lot of  progress in computers and in software, and of course, it's made a lot of  money.  But Silicon Valley is a small place, drive out to Sacramento, or  even across the bridge to Oakland, and you won't see the same prosperity.   I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform, but  state culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody  in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction, John Paul? </p><p>DEJORIA  He's right.  He is right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah. </p><p>DEJORIA  We have such a great country, and we have so many great pools out  there of people that can get things done.  People that work with their  hands as well as their minds, and it's not being spread everywhere.  And I  think by bringing more business back to the United States, and really  looking at how we're doing it, we're looking at our own growth.  And  something that people must really realize when American people and workers  grow, companies grow, because then your customer locally has enough money  to buy something and do something, and they're happier with their lives.  A  lot of what's going on in the street, people shooting people and everything  else, a lot of this may not happen in the future because people will have  more jobs, they'll have more responsibility, more of a reason to part of an  economy that's working for everybody.  So, once again, they hit some  really, really good points, and again, we need that plan on how you're  going to do to incorporate everybody into it not just a few. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  It's a really good point.  John Paul DeJoria, great to  see you, sir.  Thank you so much. </p><p>DEJORIA  Always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Thank you so much, sir.  Still to come,  the celebrations began.  I hit the convention floor with the major  highlights from Donald Trump's big night, straight ahead.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COURT REPORT)</p><p>KRIS BUDDEN, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel court report for Fox Business.  I'm Kris Budden.

And Stevie Johnson took out countryman Ryan  Harrison to book a meeting with John Isner in the quarter finals.  Johnson  closing out 4 and 4 after just over an hour on the court.  Don't forget  Tennis Channel extensive live coverage of the City Open continues Friday at  12:30 Eastern.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Forty five minutes until the opening bell sound  for a Friday.  We're looking at a higher opening for the broader averages,  from shift point depth this is off of the highs of the morning.  Dow  Industrials looking up about 17 points, earnings news still driving the  stories.  A couple of names to watch, shares of Pandora lower in the  premarket today, after revenue missed expectations.  Investors are also  reacting to a Wall Street Journal report that the company's board of  directors rejected a buyout offer from Sirius XM operator, Liberty Media,  reportedly worth nearly $15 a share, the stock is at 12 right now.  Also  watching shares of Starbucks, the stock falling after the company reported  gross sales that missed expectations, Starbucks attributing the  disappointing report to political and social unrest in the U.S. and around  the world, Starbucks missing sales targets.  Billionaire investor, Peter  Thiel's speech, among the night's biggest moment last night, the early  Facebook investor and PayPal co-founder, throwing his support behind Donald  Trump.  Joining us right now is the host of Varney &amp; Co., Stuart Varney.   And, Stuart, your thoughts on Thiel's speech -- it was pretty atoning,  wasn't it?  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, VARNEY &amp; CO. HOST:  I'm sorry, Maria, you caught me laughing  at your last news items, Starbucks thinks that they missed sales  expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>VARNEY: . because of political problems around the world and social  disorder. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As I was saying it, I'm thinking -- is this going to fly with  investors?  You're totally right. </p><p>VARNEY:  I'm -- to people who want us to engage in a conversation about  race while we waited five minutes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VARNEY: . for a cup of coffee, But I digress. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right. </p><p>VARNEY:  You've asked me about Peter Thiel, here's my take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>VARNEY:  Last night, I think we saw the emergence of a brand new Republican  Party, the old guard is dead, great speech by Donald Trump, etcetera,  etcetera.  But the symbol to me of this new Republican Party is this guy,  Peter Thiel.  He's a billionaire, he's from Silicon Valley, California, and  he's totally broken the Silicon Valley, California mold.  He comes out and  he said I am -- I'm proud to be gay.  I'm proud to be Republican.  I'm  proud to be an American.  Have you ever heard anything like that on the  final night of a GOP convention before?  Comes right out and says it,  breaks the mold.  I think the symbol of the new Republican Party, I just  loved it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I loved it, too, Stu.  You're absolutely right.  And you know  what, you may say initially Donald Trump hijacked this party, but today,  this is Donald Trump's party, period. </p><p>VARNEY:  He's brought it with him.  The Trump-Cruz fiasco the other night  was the -- a suicide note, really, political suicide note.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VARNEY: . by Ted Cruz.  That's my judgment.  Charles Krauthammer says the  same thing.  And I think the old guard is dead.  It is Donald Trump who has  created and brought in whole new rafts of people who are now thinking in  Republican terms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yep.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's not so much Republican-Democrat.  It's an American terms.   This guy has created an American Party where America comes first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yep.</p><p>VARNEY:  I haven't heard a nationalist theme in a political speech by a  major politician in decades, and we just got one last night. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, Stu, we'll see you in about 15 minutes. Thank you so  much. </p><p>VARNEY: I'm droning on, I'm sorry, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's great and we appreciate it.  Varney &amp; Co. begins every  day at 9 AM, Eastern, right after Mornings With Maria.  Stuart will be up  top of the hour.

Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to Mornings With Maria.  We are coming to you live  from Cleveland, for our special coverage of the final day of the Republican  National Convention.  Before Donald Trump took the stage last night to  accept the presidential nomination, my good friend, Joe Piscopo, took a  stroll with me throughout the delegation, and, man, it was quite the party.   Check this out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOE PISCOPO, ACTOR:  You can't make this stuff up, Maria.  You just can't  make this up.  I know we're not in Jersey anymore.  I tell you what,  everybody is excited about it.  It's a great feel, very positive on the  floor here.  But the characters that are around here, I can't believe this,  you know. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's take a look because I just found the sister-in-law to  governor Mike Pence, Denise pence.  Denise Pence, good to see you. </p><p>DENISE PENSE:  Good to see you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, you are the sister-in- law of Governor Pence. </p><p>PENCE:  I am. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're a delegate. </p><p>PENCE:  And I'm a delegate from the great state of Indiana.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about Governor Pence. </p><p>PENCE:  He's -- what you see is what you get.  He's a wonderful, wonderful  person, all about family, as I think Mr. Trump is all about family. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joe, what an amazing moment.  This is emotional.  She teared up  on us. </p><p>PISCOPO:  I know, it's so genuine, everybody is so -- it seem so genuine.   And you know what, can I talk to you in going to the New York and New  Jersey delegation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, let's do it.</p><p>PISCOPO:  Are you down with this? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you down with it, and let's talk to our cameraman here. </p><p>PISCOPO:  Let's do it.  It's going to be -- I've got your back, Maria.   I've got your back, come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here we go.  Here we go. </p><p>PISCOPO:  Look, wait, I think it's Mike Pence for a second.  Oh, sorry. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He looks like him.  You look like him. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look like Mike Pence.  And you're not Mike Pence. </p><p>PISCOPO:  A great speech last night. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I hope you enjoyed it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I love that Donald Trump with New York, front and  center, New York front and center, and Chris Christie at New Jersey front  and center, doesn't always happen last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm telling you it's really -- this is your chance. </p><p>PISCOPO:  Here's what we do in Jersey. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's do it.  What do we do in Jersey? </p><p>PISCOPO:  Joey!  Joey!</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I'm with the New York delegation, I'm with the  Jersey guys here, you know, Piscopo and all of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we wanted to see New Jersey.</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  And I've got to say, he was with Trump before I was.   He's used to harass me on his radio show to come out with Donald Trump.   So, it's not really for Trump, but I'm scared of Piscopo, and that's why  I'm here tonight. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  This is history being made right here today.  We are  going to be talking about this for many, many years, and people will be  talking about Joe Piscopo's tie, too. </p><p>PISCOPO:  I think Carl Paladino -- this is the guy came on the radio show,  Maria, he was the first and foremost front and center for Donald Trump.   This guy right here. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  In New York, the first congressman to endorse Donald  Trump, the first state chair to endorse Donald Trump, and you are right  there.</p><p>PISCOPO:  Do the know Donald Trump isn't Guam. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, absolutely, we know who he is.  He's the one  that's going to help Guam make it better.  Guam is the tip of the spear for  the United States, where American names began. </p><p>PISCOPO:  Make Guam great again.  There it is. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah. </p><p>PISCOPO:  It's a party in Cleveland. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it's a party. </p><p>PISCOPO:  You're a young guy, a young guy supporting Donald Trump.  </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, I'm -- County in Virginia, Rockingham County.   James Madison University, young people, we're being taxed to death.  I have  no health insurance.  My premium went up 2.5 and adjustable went up 2.5.   Hey, in Virginia we like the second amendment. </p><p>PISCOPO:  Can I have one of those?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't know that I can take it, but now I'm  happening. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  Maria, how are you, darling?  Great to see you, what a  great night, huh? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazing night.  How are you doing? </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm doing good.  I'm excited about tonight, a great  convention.  Let's make Donald Trump the next president of the United  States. </p><p>PISCOPO:  The biggest Hillary supporter on the planet right here. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm trying to convince Joe Piscopo to come along with  Donald Trump from day one.  He finally said yes.  He's now on the right  train, Trump train. </p><p>PISCOPO:  Because he scares me. </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I tried.  I terrified you into it.</p><p>PISCOPO:  And we just-- </p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  And I got on the Trump train, all right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for the party on the RNC floor.

Good to see you everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: That reveal while -- why I'm curious just  right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Do it. Do it. Do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott's daughter Ayla sung the National anthem last night. And  she just sang it for her packs in front London.</p><p>So, we were listening to it and she were going to come up. We're going to  talk about that later. But .</p><p>SCOTT BROWN, FORMER SENATOR MASSACHUSSETTS: I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know he's so proud.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can't hear it without .</p><p>BROWN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: .crying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She did such a phenomenal job.</p><p>BROWN: Listen, we're blessed that she did -- she said it was the -- and  she's has sang all over the world. And she said it was the highlight of her  career. So, we're very thankful obviously for everyone's kind words and the  -- hey what can you say? I'm a proud dad.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course.

We've got New York Congressmen Lee Zeldin joining  us, retired U.S. Marine core general Anthony Zinni is with us, billionaire  investor and cofounder Paul Mitchell, John Paul De Joria with us and  comedian Joe Piscopo stopping by as well.</p><p>Ivanka Trump, taking center stage last night to introduce her father for  his record marking speech at the RNC, Fox News's John Roberts live in  Cleveland with the latest.</p><p>John, over to you.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you.</p><p>Two proud daughters, this morning is Scott Brown for Ayla's fantastic job  last night at the Convention and Donald Trump for the job of his Ivanka --  his daughter Ivanka did last night.</p><p>You know, when it comes to Donald Trump's speech. I think what we really  saw was a launch pad to how he is going to run this general election. A man  who is going to be a candidate rather whose going to be his own man, who's  not afraid to depart from Republican Orthodoxy when he believes it's  necessary.</p><p>In other words some of the familiar Republican themes during the speech  last night about growing the economy, tax-cuts but some of it could have  been taken out of the Democratic Playbook. You know, this idea about  creating opportunity for Americans from all walks of life and giving them a  shot at the American dream.</p><p>Here's Trump from last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: My pledge reads I'm with you, the American people. I am your  voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who  dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight, I am with you, I  will fight for you and I will win for you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Trump did not spend much time at all and in a kind of ghazi  recitation of his life story. That task was left the daughter, Ivanka Trump  who talked at length about the type of person her father was and how that  for her, he appears to be all about creating opportunity in business and  other areas particularly for women.</p><p>Listen to what she told the audience.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP: This is long been the philosophy of the Trump Organization.  At my father's company there are more female than male executives. Women  are paid equally for the works that we do and when a woman becomes a mother  she is supported, not shut out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Of course Ivanka Trump, herself became a mother just a couple of  months ago. Interesting to note too Maria, that this sub Theme the Donald  Trump is talking about, \"I will fight for you\", that happened to be the  main Theme of Al Gore's campaign back in the 2000 campaign. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right John. Thank you. John Roberts in Cleveland, this  morning.</p><p>Donald Trump accepted GOP presidential nomination with the biggest business  pitch of his career but didn't resinate with voters.</p><p>I want to bring in Pollster, Lee Carter who will take us through some of  the key moments from the speech and show us and show us the voter reaction.</p><p>Lee, good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's start with Donald Trump talking about being the law and  order candidate. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: I have a message to every last person threatening the peace  on our streets and the safety of our police. When I take the oath of office  next year, I will restore law and order to the country.</p><p>Believe me. Believe me.</p><p>I will work with and appoint the best and brightest prosecutors and law  enforcement officials to get the job properly done.</p><p>In this race for the White House I am the law and order candidate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, Lee? What are we looking at there to the  president?</p><p>CARTER: So, the Republicans, the red line, it went off the chart top as  high as it could go with an  plus, with Independents it was a B and  Democrats it was a D which is not all that surprising. But what we have  heard this week, early in the week ready Rudy Giuliani. This speech, people  really want order back in this country and a lot of people are calling  speech fear mongering and say that he did that too much. But that's not  what the people said. They stay feel protected, they feel hopeful and they  feel like he's the job -- he can do the job. He's fought in the right  people and demonstrated that this week. So, it really did resonate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. So that we have Ivanka Trump introducing her father, she  spoke about her record for equality for women within the Trump  Organization.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP: At my father's company there are more female than male  Executives. Women are paid equally for the works that we do and when a  woman becomes a mother she is supported, not shut out.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What did that say, Lee? Now, Donald Trump for sure puts on lags  Hillary when it comes from support from women.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did the comments move the needle?</p><p>CARTER: I think they very well could. And Ivanka was an amazing spokesman  and for they have the fact on our side. They were able to demonstrate that  they do have equal pay. They have any experience about women and it's  really resonating.</p><p>You could see there, the Republicans off the charts again with an A.  Independent it gave them something to think about and Democrats for a C  which ultimately isn't that bad considering the way things have been.  Democrats usually are on the floor when we're talking about Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do guys agree with this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And Ivanka seemed to suggest, suggest mind you that her  father favors pay -- help with childcare, subsidized childcare and even  paid family leave.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which is a Democratic talking points. But again, we'll see where  that goes in the month of few months ahead.</p><p>BROWN: And the Democrats do that regularly.</p><p>I know in my office when I was a senator I paid women more than I paid the  men. Just how it turned out and the people that I had run against, it was  the reverse and it was, you now, just about bullet points, talking points.  It's not really in fact as you referenced there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah. And there's a lot of discussion and whether we are just  too politically correct in the county right now.</p><p>Donald Trump discussed this last night as well. Listen to this. Got to get  your take on that one.</p><p>CARTER: Yup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot  afford to be so politically correct anymore.</p><p>So, if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and  the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week, go  there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did that resonate?</p><p>CARTER:  It really did.  I mean you could see the Republicans there off the  charts again.  He had an amazing night with Republicans and Independents as  well, Democrats, he wasn't expecting to move them along that, you know,  that. But he had to deliver the goods last night and what the voters said  was he did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah. He said he's ready to go to work for the American people.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  I have had a truly great life in business, but now, my sole  and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for  you.  It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.  We don't win  any more but we are going to start winning again.</p><p>But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did he say enough to win over Independents with that?</p><p>CARTER:  You know I have really think he had a great night with  Independents.  We've been seeing Independents have been tracking with  Republicans are match for this election.</p><p>But this was a night where people really were going to take a look.   They're going to start thinking about whether or not they're going to cast  their vote for him.  He had to be more substantive and I really believed  that the voters that responded to us said I'm going to give it a second  thought and really believed, I was like, I think he's going to have a big  bump.  We're going to see it next week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Despite the headlines that were written by people who either  they wrote them before he spoke or even didn't watch the speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>BROWN:  Right.  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  No, I think .</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shame on them for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Washington Post is particularly negative on Trump.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROWN:  Did you actually do anything on the prosecution of Hillary and e- mails and that -- the trustworthy, credibility issue.  What were your  thoughts and views there?</p><p>CARTER:  From earlier this week?</p><p>BROWN:  From -- actually from the speech was there anything like that?</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think that what people did talk about and they  responded they had a different tone last night.  And instead of talking  about crooked Hillary, talked to her about his opponent, he talked about  those kinds of things.  And he did in a much more eloquent way than he has  before and that people did respond to that.  They're more willing to listen  to it.</p><p>BROWN:  So, what's your prediction in terms of the bump, any number?</p><p>CARTER:  I'm not exactly sure.  I think I've heard people say it could be  as high as 10.  I think at least 5 points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of people said 10 points.  But you know what else?  So  who told us earlier in the week, Dagen that you want to look at it?  I  think it was John Bolton, Ambassador John Bolton.</p><p>He said you want to look 10 days after the Democratic Convention about  really what the impact of these conventions will be on both parties?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BROWN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Its one week and then two weeks -- it's roughly two weeks after  the start of the RNC.</p><p>I want to point out Ivanka did not mention Hillary Clinton in her speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She didn't -- that was calculated, it has been enough early.  It  was about her dad, give the American people reason to vote for him not  against her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She didn't want to be in anti.  She didn't want to be negative.   Lee Carter, great stuff.</p><p>CARTER:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.</p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  See you soon, Lee.</p><p>Coming up, Big Mac's in Venezuela missing one key ingredients.  Behind  McDonald's decision to change the menu that has customers open arms.</p><p>Then outrage over the NBA's decision to relocate the all-star game out of  Charlotte.</p><p>More on the controversial decision and the impact in the local economy,  straight ahead, we're back in two minutes time live from Cleveland at the  Republican National Convention.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BERTIROMO:  Welcome back Baton Rouge preparing for funerals of the three  police officers who were shot to death in an ambush last Sunday.  Cheryl  Casone, with the story and the head lines in New York right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yeah that's right, good morning, Maria.</p><p>Well the city is getting ready to say goodbye to three heroes this weekends  services for Matthew Gerald are set for this morning in Baton Rouge, the  41-year-old, Army and marine veteran, graduated from the Police Academy  earlier this year.</p><p>But station of funeral services for 45-year-old Sheriff's deputy Brad  Garafola will take place tomorrow.  Garafola was a 24-year veteran of the  Sheriff's Office.</p><p>And services for 32-year-old, Montrell Jackson will be held on Monday.

His  Facebook post before his death about the dangerous environment went viral  after his death in Baton Rouge.</p><p>Well, we got some breaking news coming out of India.  Looks like an Indian  Air Force plane with 29 people on board has now gone missing.  This news is  coming out of New Delhi right now.</p><p>We're showing you a map right now.

But after the plane was supposed to land and in three hours even  after that, the plane has not been seen or heard from there's a massive air  and water search underway right now for that missing Aircraft.</p><p>And then also, we got some news coming out of Venezuela.</p><p>McDonald's stopped selling the Big Mac in Venezuela.  That's because the  company can't find the bread that it needs to make the iconic and -- well  pretty good hamburger.  These of course follow in the countries massive  shortages.  McDonald's already have to suspend sales of French fries last  year in Venezuela.</p><p>Now, in Venezuela, the food shortages have been triggered by an economic  crisis after the global plunge in oil prices and of course as you on your  screen there.  The humanitarian situation, Maria in Venezuela continues to  get worst day by day.</p><p>And that's all of headlines from New York.

Speaking to her .</p><p>BARTIROMO: She was amazing.</p><p>BROWN: She never gets nervous ever and as we're heading up here yesterday,  says, \"Oh my gosh, I can't believe how nervous I am.\"  And then I said,  \"When did that stop,\" she says, \"When people started singing with me.\" I  said, \"Oh men, this is so cool.\" And she said, it is the highlight of her  career and she's been doing it for 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How wonderful.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah. Thank you for bringing that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you kidding, it was just wonderful.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The only thing I miss was in NASCAR races, they sing the anthem.

Here's the fun piece of trivia for you. The Trump- Pence ticket may be too short in terms of syllables to make America great  again.</p><p>Since 1900, the presidential ticket with the most syllables has won the  general election with the exception of President Bush's reelection in 2004.</p><p>What do you think -- here, the year .</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, there is no logic. If you're going to ask me, there's no  logic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Shorter syllable tickets of either party only prevailed eight  times in 29 presidential election since 1900. And in -- but in most of the  instances where they prevailed, a Bush was on the ticket.</p><p>BROWN: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, I'm sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's -- I guess, you would call it statistically insignificant  data pool.  How is that?  Yeah.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Politics has been turned on its head this year. So I just trust  any .</p><p>MCDOWELL: But again, single -- so two, you know, it's only two syllables in  that ticket then that working against and if you look at that report.</p><p>And -- so the answer to party some politics might be Netflix consumer  research company, E-Poll has compiled a list of Republicans and Democrats  favorite television shows.</p><p>Here are the three shows that make the Top 10 list of both parties.  Supernatural, which I've never watch, Morgan's over here shaking our head.</p><p>ORTAGUS: No, I'm looking at it a bit .</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Big Bang Theory which is actually the top-rated comedy in all  of televisions so that was great of course but both Republicans and  Democrats watch that and then the Walking Dead.</p><p>Supernatural tops the list for Republicans and of course, Game of Thrones  is the Democrat's number one pick.</p><p>BROWN: Oh come on man, it was my favorite -- that's my favorite show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Game of Throne?</p><p>BROWN: Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS: The best show in this history of television.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I have not seen any of those shows.</p><p>BROWN: Seen everyone, I love Atlanta too. Atlanta is very .</p><p>MCDOWELL: I read the blogs on Game of Thrones.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm like House of Cards still Dagen, you know that's my  favorite.</p><p>BROWN: Winter is coming.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Winter is here. House of Cards isn't on either the top 10 list  and either is Veep so again .</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, there I miss that now. That's the show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is the show, I totally agree.</p><p>Do we have time to look at this Hillary Clinton t-shirt? This was one of  the best selling t-shirt, I think it says, Hillary for prison is the .</p><p>ORTAGUS: I saw that yesterday. That was .</p><p>BROWN: There is some incredible -- there is some .</p><p>MCDOWELL: The pro Trump-Pence is not -- I think that's how you went a lot.</p><p>BROWN: There are some incredible t-shirts and merchandise. My wife and  daughter went out like they're going to shopping spree. We have bags and  bags of stuff.

Very different traffic moving streets  many of the streets already back, reopened, all of the big security force  is gone, very different from earlier in the week.</p><p>We did have protests. But I'll you we had a lot worse protests at previous  Republican Conventions, than we did here. Unprecedented number of police  had a protest yesterday over the bridge. Only one group took advantage of  the bridge, the big long parade route. People were supposed to be on that  all the time one time, they used it, pretty amazing.</p><p>Yes, you're right we did have a disruption at the Donald Trump's speech  last night.

We will be live all week, Jeff, and you're  right, a lot of -- I think it's in the thousands, tens of thousands are  planning to protest.</p><p>Jeff thanks you so much. Jeff Flock, live on the ground this morning in  Cleveland. They were plenty of highs and lows from Donald Trump lengthy  speech last night, as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination.  Take a listen to some of the high lights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nobody knows this system better  than me, which is why I alone can fix it. My opponent asks certain  supporters to recite a three word loyalty pledge. It reads, \"I'm with her.\"</p><p>I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads \"I'm with you, the  American people.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to bring in a Hank Sheinkopf right now with Democratic  strategist and former campaign advisory to Bill Clinton and John Jordan a  Republican strategists. Good to see both gentlemen. Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>JOHN JORDAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Good morning</p><p>BARTIROMO: John, let me kick it off with you, your highlights from Trump's  speech last night. What did you take away?</p><p>HANK SHEINKOPF, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well Maria, Mr. Trump last night  served notice on the left that the new Republican Party, is going to  compete for minority votes. You know, some might say this is a little  event, certainly a challenge for Republican but all he has to do is be one  or two points better than Romney or McCain did especially if the Democrats  don't get the turnout among their core groups they normally have.</p><p>And Mr. Trump doesn't have a certain appeal for that. He always to do is do  great -- much better job and relative to Hillary Clinton. Be just a little  more charming. And that he could win decisively especially where is with  white boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, there is also real outreach to the gay and lesbian  community last night. No doubt about it, PayPal co-founder and tech  billionaire Peter Thiel spoke last night. He made history at the RNC.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER THIEL, PAYPAL CO-FOUNDER AND TECH BILLIONAIRE: I'm not a politician.  But neither is Donald Trump. He is a builder and it's time to rebuild  America. Of course, every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be  gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an  American.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That I thought that was that stunning. I thought it was  terrific. John, what do you think?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I think it's the Republican Party moving beyond the platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>JORDAN: I mean all that the Trump people truly kind of going beyond that,  the platform is kind of an antiquated idea that, you know, was more  relevant in elections past than it is today because now, it's kind of just  been some subsumed by the candidate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hank Sheinkopf weigh in here. You're a big .</p><p>SHEINKOPF: Highlight is Trump. Donald Trump finally looks like he's running  for president supposed to addressing a rally of some kind where who knows  what to these were elements are about. That's the good news. The Republican  I think that can win a lot of minority votes probably delusion at some of  the Republicans talk about an awful a lot.</p><p>But the real issue here is the kind of coalition that Donald Trump is  putting together, very different than anything we've seen before. The  attack on the elites, even discussions my campaign and adviser of this  about bringing back Glass-Steagall, that's an attempt to bring white, blue  collared people together with others including gays and coming up with the  different kind of way thinking about things, more he integrated and less  destructive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What did you think of Peter Thiel?</p><p>SHEINKOPF: I thought it was pretty stunning. And that frankly talks this --  what this indicates is the lack of dominance by the religious right in  Republican Party politics which probably will makes some room for all kinds  of other people.</p><p>SCOTT BROWN: And I was with Peter in the greenroom prior to his speech. And  I -- he was a little nervous. I'm going to be honest with you and I said,  \"Listen, just speak from your heart. Tell people what's in your heart and  what the message you want to get out because they're going to listen to  you.\"</p><p>The people in the crowd were very receptive. They -- it is I think a  different as we referenced Morgan many times in different and wider tent,  bigger tent Republican Party and that's a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is Donald Trump did that?</p><p>JORDAN: Yeah. And it was standing ovation he got. So you saw the reaction  from the crowd that, you know, what he said really, really did resonate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was courageous.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR: John, I'm curious, in the  past we saw is the religious right did not come up. This is Ted Cruz's  argument this year that the religious right did not come out four years ago  and that's why Mitt Romney lost.</p><p>With our nominee and talking about LGBTQ rights, his daughter talking about  it, do you think that was suppress the religious right vote or Pence sort  of make that up.</p><p>JORDAN: One of the things you say in the primary this cycle is that the  religious right as we understood it to be didn't vote on the issues or for  the candidates. We all thought they would. You look how Ted Cruz really  didn't do that. But you have thrice divorce media mogul who did really well  with them. There was a higher work -- more votes for the Republican nominee  this time than ever before, so .</p><p>BROWN: I don't know that those rules still apply.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROWN: We oppose to Maria that is an American first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>BROWN: You know, American first, that is the key and that's what people are  forgetting and I think there is going to be a stark contrast between what  happened here and what's going to happen in a couple days in Philly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, he said, I am proud to be gay. I'm proud to be Republican.  I'm proud to be an American. Hank what you're saying?</p><p>SHEINKOPF: Well, what was the same very simply? Everybody seems to have the  amnesia here. There's a whole history of attacks on gays of alleges right  of separation of blacks and Latin's. The discussion about violence, about  immigrants, I'm not going to provide this rosy picture that you all think  is going to happen.</p><p>But what is important here is that anyone has any doubts that Donald Trump  can win this election in the fall is just plain wrong. That's the  overriding theme that comings through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about Hillary's news today. Who will her V.P. be?  She's going to probably announce this today what's your take?</p><p>SHEINKOPF: Look, Kaine seems to be in a much better position if you read  the New York Times, this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tim Kaine.</p><p>SHEINKOPF: I think that that's a probably a big mistake that it would be  better to have somebody from the mid west not that -- it would compete with  Pence but if you can feel much more like places. She needs to win and do  better, whether a white men who have been in the blue collar workforce and  feel their futures that kind of stunted.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What concerns you most about the Hillary ticket, Hank?</p><p>SHEINKOPF: What concerns anybody most who thinks about this is Trump is  creating coalition. It's going to be very hard to get around. He has three  significant negatives against her. How do you find somebody, running for  vice President, who can talk economics, military security and say, \"By the  way, she may -- you may not like a lot of things about her but she's the  one and get the job done.\" It's very difficult fit. And it's going to be  hard to get past this Trump arguments which where very, very well done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the trust issue is sticking. And one of the things .</p><p>SHEINKOPF: It never left.</p><p>ORTAGUS: It was Tim Kaine. Yeah, with Tim Kaine has the base is going after  him this week. Because he singed a letter to regulators wanting to at least  loosen some jurisdiction on community banks and local banks. And that  Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren left was going after him for that. So,  we might see an uprising if he's the V.P.</p><p>JORDAN: It's even reported last week that there would be. But he was on the  list of people that was unacceptable to a lot of Bernie people. And they  promised to make a little bit of stake at convention if he was nominated.</p><p>BROWN: And you have Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders left occupy Wall  Street moveon.org. Remember Elizabeth Warren was the creator of the occupy  Wall Street movement. They're already camping out. They're ready to let the  -- their people know Hillary Clinton that they're angry. Because they feel  that Bernie and Elizabeth Warren have sold out to Hillary Clinton, probably  Wall Street.</p><p>SHEINKOPF: Nobody could do more damage than Ted Cruz that on a national  Television than any party, frankly.</p><p>And it was good news about Republicans .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHEINKOPF: . takes up front first. And they've now gone away for a while.  The Democratic lunatics will disappear because they understand mistakes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh God. Hank Sheinkopf, you are so direct. I love it.</p><p>SHEINKOPF: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, sir. Hank Sheinkopf , John Jordan, thank you  very much gentlemen. We will see you soon. And we will see you in  Philadelphia next week.</p><p>Don't miss our live coverage of the Democratic National Convention right  here on the program.</p><p>Coming up, in American Airlines emergency in Florida, more on plane  malfunction that sent 24 people to the hospital.</p><p>Then Charlotte's economy bracing for a major hit in the wake up the NBA's  decision to relocate the All-star game.</p><p>More in the whopping cost the local business straight ahead, we're live  this morning from Cleveland. Keep it right here on Mornings with Maria.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the NBA moving the 2017 All-Star game from Time  Warner Cable in Charlotte, North Carolina to another state, the governor  the obviously very upset about this.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with that and the other headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Now, that is right, Maria very upset. So the  move is because the NBA objects to North Carolina house bill two which  limits anti-discrimination protection for lesbian, gay and transgender  people in that state.</p><p>And the NBA's decision to relocate the game will cost of North Carolina an  estimated $100 million. And of course Governor Pat McCrory furious about  this, he says, \"Left wing special interest groups have no moral authority  to try to intimidate the large majority of American parents who agree and  common sense bathroom and shower privacy for children.</p><p>Well, some various scary moments on board on in American airlines plane in  Florida before it even left the ground. Two dozen people were taken to the  hospital with minor injuries after an Airbus 320 developed a hydraulic leak  while it was on taxi way yesterday. This happened at Palm Beach Internation  Airport.</p><p>Many of the passengers suffering from burning eyes, itchy skin and  breathing problems, they used emergency slides to evacuate the plane which  was bound for Philadelphia. American apologizing for what it says was a  quote \"Maintenance issue.\"</p><p>And finally there is some business this morning. The launch of Apple car  might have been delayed. Now reports said that Apple pushed back its target  launch from 2020 to 2021.</p><p>Some reports says that have Apple is working, of course on Electric car  that's got self-driving features. The company though has never acknowledged  these claims or these reports.</p><p>Tesla CEO, Elon Musk describes Apple's car project does, \"The worst kept  secret in Silicon valley\". You might have a point.</p><p>And now finally this, it is the end of an era. The world last producer of  home use video cassette recorders is ending production at the end of the  month. The company in Japan, is Funai Electronics says the reason is  declining sales and difficulty now finding parts.</p><p>At one point the company sold as many as 50 Million VCRs. But in 2015, that  was sales down to 750,000 units.</p><p>OK, Maria the magnetic VCR tapes first introduced in Japan 1976. They came  to the United States in 1977. I can tell you Maria personally I still have  about of 30 cassette tapes in my apartment. Maybe I can put them on e-bay.  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah. Now I know. You're right me, too. I actually I miss them  because now everything is digital. And you can't really save things that  much. There you.</p><p>CASONE: I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure. Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, do you just point into hire opening for the boarder  markets today after snapping a nine day winning streak yesterday when  investors should expect from the last trading session of the week.</p><p>Plus the internet erupting in the wake of Donald Trump's acceptance speech,  we are breaking down the best social media moments of the night.</p><p>You don't want to miss that, back in a moment right here live from  Cleveland.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Nobody knows the system better than me. Which is why I alone can fix  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Republican nominee Donald Trump last night delivering  one of the most particular lines on social media. From the Republican  National Convention, in Cleveland, Dagen is looking at all top moments of  the week right now what did you learn?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I learned some stuff that the Democrats  and the Liberals drive a lot of social media conversation. So that was a  line from Trump's speech last night. And it was the most tweeted about  moment according to Twitter's internal information.</p><p>In fact all three of the top moments during the final night of the RNC came  from Trump's speech. But you can see that first one, because again, the  thing that -- in that first one that we just heard \"Why I alone can fix  it,\" that's what the Democrats jumped on \"The alone,\" part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the second most tweeted -- right. The second most tweeted  moment was Trump's reference to the LGBTQ community and the Orlando terror  attack. The third moment was his defense of law enforcement quote, \"An  attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.\"</p><p>So, that first one though people were making fun of the \"Alone\" remark like  he's going to do it by himself. I think that that's why it was one of the  most.</p><p>BROWN: They're nitpicking as usual, the Democrats and the media, the  mainstream liberal media are going to drive the conversation and change the  conversation because I thought he had a fantastic night. I thought this  convention was exiting the enthusiasm was off the charts. If you went  around the Convention Center people actually paying attention, they weren't  lowly gagging around, they weren't eating and, you know, joking around,  they were focused on listening to the speakers and being part of this  historic day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, this is the Twitter data shows that this tweet from Senator  Bernie Sanders was the most retweeted tweet during Donald Trump's speech.</p><p>So again at least, Democrats were listening I guess. Sanders reacting to  Trump's one, \"I alone can do this,\" tweeting \"This guy running for  president or dictator #RNC with Bernie.\"</p><p>So -- And by the way, speaking of VCRs, Bernie Sanders, there was a photo  of him sitting in front of T.V. watching Trump speech and he has an old  VCR.</p><p>BROWN: It's no surprise that they're going to try to tear that apart  because we don't have leadership right now. At least Donald Trump is saying  I am going to fix because certainly Washington isn't fixing anything. So,  he's going to go down there and that's of the reasons I ended up supporting  him because he's going to get down there and shake it up.</p><p>ORTAGUS: There was actually some parts of the speech that I didn't care for  just to be balanced. But I actually thought that \"I alone can fix it,\" I  thought that was one of the stronger parts when he -- every time he talks  about the system being ridged and saying that he's come again to break that  Washington, that's the strongest part for me.</p><p>BROWN: Takes leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, the police provided great security all week. And they even  have the time to have some fun on Twitter. On Tuesday, they posted this  tweet most difficult missing person case in history hash tag .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then Thursday, the Cleveland Clinic posted this tweet of  Cleveland police getting ready for the day with some sunrise yoga, we love  sunrise yoga.</p><p>ORTAGUS: That's funny. Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm assuming that we've actually slept the night before. And  here's your feel good story of the week, I think certainly on social media  #getIvankaherearringback. College student, Annabelle Murray posted this  picture at 10:17 a.m. yesterday, where they picture of Ivanka's earring  that she found at the RNC. She posted the second tweet of the found earring  and tweeter users retweeted that of that over 300 times, by 3:40 p.m.  Thursday, Annabelle posted this tweet with Ivanka.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROWN: Well, that's very cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's pretty earring.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The power of social media. So Ivanka got her earring back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is very cool.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good stuff. Over all take away. Senator before you go.</p><p>BROWN: Listen, it is going to be such a contrast to next week. I'm really,  really excited to be in Philly next week to see how the other side is going  to kind of counter what we saw here this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right take a moment, senator.</p><p>Dagen, thank you for the social media .</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We wanted you to take a moment to connect with us on social  media.

Your top stories right  now at 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.

These are the forgotten  men and women of our country.  And they are forgotten, but they're not  going to be forgotten long.  These are people who work hard but no longer  have a voice.  I am your voice. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland, Clinton  looking to make waves ahead of the democratic convention next week,  expected to name her vice presidential pick at an event in Florida today.   On to the business world, a massive headache for General Motors to report,  the company is recalling over 4 million vehicles.  Chipotle profitable  again, the result however didn't miss expectations, leaving investors  hungry for growth.  We'll tell you about it.  Then Facebook's drone taking  flight, the stunning images of its maiden voyage.  Markets this morning are  pointing to a higher opening once again, after snapping a nine-day trading  win.

In Europe this morning, markets are searching  for some direction.  Take a look, investors are watching manufacturing data  out of the Eurozone and many of their purchasing manger's indexes were  below expectations.  In Asia overnight, markets were lower, led by Japan's  Nikkei average big names like Nintendo in the red making Nikkei average  down better than 1%.  All of those stories coming up this morning and  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Maverick Pac National Co-chair Morgan Ortagus and former Massachusetts  Senator and Trump supporter, Scott Brown.  Good morning every body.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  That's my Hillary voice.  That's my \"I didn't  sleep enough\" voice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As much as I was watching Donald Trump's speech, I thought Peter  Thiel, what he did and what Ivanka Trump did, really drove home various  messages. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Thiel, I'm proud to be gay.  I'm proud to be Republican,  I'm proud to be an American. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The first time that's ever happened where someone went on stage  and quite said, I am gay on a GOP, in front of a GOP convention audience,  the first time it's ever happened. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was stunning and he got lots of applause for it.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Ivanka was the speech of the week for me.  I mean, she is my age,  we're both young, millennial women.  She spoke about women, you know,  earning the same as men.  She spoke about young mothers and what that's  like in the workforce.  I think that she had warmth and grace and a message  that would really attract young women.  It was the speech of the week,  yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a dress from her line that's not very expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I saw that.</p><p>BROWN:  The important thing is, well, the important thing was Donald Trump  did exactly what he had to do.  He needed to really not, I think, veer off  too far away.  There were times when he kind of looked at the crowd and was  very humble, and you know, cracked a couple of jokes and I thought that  really brought out some good personality.  And I thought he had every  single topic.  My wife and family and a lot of folks around the convention  center were like, whoa, okay, you know, I wish he had done that a while  ago.  So here we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it was a great night.  We're going to talk all about it  this morning and joining us to talk about it is Texas Congressman, Louie  Gohmert is with us.

Also with us Comedian Joe Piscopo, you don't want to miss a moment with  them, so if you stay with us as we kick it off right now with top story.   Donald Trump accepting the Republican nomination last night with a historic  address to the crowd.  Blake Berman is live in the Quicken Loans Arena  right now with all the highlights, Blake. </p><p>BERMAN:  Hi there Maria, good morning to you.  Donald Trump really did not  reinvent the wheel last night as far as it relates to the issues that he's  talked about over the last 400 days of his campaign, trade, immigration,  security.  However, he certainly hit the gas pedal as it relates to  focusing on Hillary Clinton and that'll be his focus from now until  November.  One issue that definitely stood out here last night was the  issue of security, especially in light of the recent shootings here all  across the country in the last couple of weeks.  Trump started off his  speech by saying beginning January 20th, 2017, quoting here, he says,  safety will be restored.  Trump was introduced last night by his daughter  Ivanka and then an hour and 15 minutes later, the longest convention speech  in some four-plus decades, Trump made this vow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Friends, delegates and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully  accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.  To all  Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make  this promise.  We will make America strong again.  We will make America  proud again.  We will make America safe again.  And we will make America  great again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Coming back out here live from the Quicken Loans Arena, you can  see the party is quite literally over here this morning, construction crews  taking things down.  They got to get everything out of here.  Now, the  attention turns over to Philadelphia where it is quite a different scene  this morning as the preparations there are underway now.  The Democrats  will have their turn, Hillary Clinton will be in the spotlight and many  will be keeping an eye on today, possibly tomorrow as to who she will  select as her vice presidential running mate.  Maria, back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Berman with the  latest there, Donald Trump savoring the moment he officially became the  Republican nominee for president, his speech clocking in at about 75  minutes as you heard, the longest national party convention acceptance  speech since 1972.  I want to bring in the Fox News contributors, Mercedes  Schlapp, a Republican strategist and Julie Roginsky, a Democratic  strategist.  Ladies, it's good to see you both.  Mercedes, it's good to  talk with you, your reaction to all these since last night and the speech.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, I got to tell you Maria, it  was incredibly, just there was so much energy in that room, I think the  delegates responded so well.  And I was texting with folks back at home,  individuals who kept saying he's doing a great job.  And why he was focused  on the working class message, I think was incredibly important for him to  be able to address the workers.  And one of my favorite lines was when he  goes after big business, when he goes after the elite media and basically  saying Hillary is with them.  I'm not with them, I'm your champion.  And I  think that message really resonate across America.  I think the biggest  challenge is going to be in terms of whether he's able to attract again the  women and the minorities which I think Ivanka did a great job. Sometimes I  wish I would have both of them on to stage at the same time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  I wonder if Ivanka's performance will  move the needle in terms of the female voter.  I want to talk about that  this morning.  But Julie, what's your take?  What grade would you give  Trump last night? </p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You know, I give him a C minus and  I'll explain why.  He did what he had to do for the B because certainly, it  gave him the red meat as they demanded, but he didn't really move the  needle much with anybody else.  Look, if you are scared to death and you  think Hillary Clinton in the anti-Christ, you're already voting for Donald  Trump.  You need to expand that out to people who are on the fence and  dependents, potentially the Democrats that he was trying to get would  appeal to Bernie Sanders' voters.  But it was such a dystopian dark speech,  people called it the midnight in America's speech.  And it really was, that  it didn't do much for people who were hoping for some solutions for him and  hoping for something positive.  Ivanka gave the speech last night that he  should have given.  They should have just flipped scripts.  She was  fantastic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. </p><p>ROGINSKY:  She had a bright speech.  She appealed to the better angels in  our country.  She did not, and I feel like he kind of stepped on the sorry  that she was trying to tell that time.</p><p>BROWN:  Maria, with respect to Julie, a C minus I think that's really  ridiculous.  He gave a fantastic speech and did exactly what he needed to  do.  And if you would just look at the focus groups after the fact, a lot  of those folks in those focus groups are not voting for Hillary at all, and  a lot of them actually are coming over to Donald Trump.  He showed humility  and he showed humor and I thought he laid a very matter-of-factly, the  differences between him and Hillary and also the things that he wants to  tackle on his first hundred days in office.  So I thought it was one of the  better speeches in my family by the way who were not going to vote for him,  were kind of on the fence at this point.  They're all in now.  So that's a  good thing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah I want to -- Well actually C minus is hard.  What would  you give him Mercedes?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I gave him a B and the reason why it's above average is the fact  that it was a very long speech.  So I think you'll lose a lot of the folks  going through.  And I think the strongest points were at the end.  I think  he was very strong when he -- he softened his tongue when he spoke about  his parents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  He was -- when he was able to connect in terms of saying, you  know, it's about Hillary, it's about I'm with her.  But I am with you.   That is such a strong and powerful message.</p><p>And I think what he tried to do was talk about the dreary picture of the  State of America and then he moved to the positive where we need to be  going moving forward.  I wish I could have seen more of that just one in  the beginning of the speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That has been the big issue from critics.  That it was a  dire speech.  I didn't see it that way.  But --</p><p>BROWN:  The crowd didn't see it that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the crowd --</p><p>ROGINSKY:  And the people at home didn't see it that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, but the crowd -- </p><p>ROGINSKY:  What I thought was really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yeah.  I was going to say, the crowd with all due respect are  already with him.  And that's my whole point.  Senator, with all due  respect, you're already with him.   So, you're not the message -- you're  not person to whom the message needs to appeal.  Who it needs to appeal to  are -- </p><p>BROWN:  I should go home then I guess Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Are the people that needs to appeal to, or the people that are  watching from home.  And consistently, what I saw was this very dark,  dystopian vision of America, which I think most people don't share.  We  believe that we're a great country.  We don't believe that we're going off  a cliff despite what he does -- he has to say.</p><p>It's a speech that Vladimir Putin, that Vladimir Putin could have given  about this country.  It's not a speech that somebody who loves and cares  about this country and thinks it's great, needs to get and that's the  problem. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the talking points from the critical...</p><p>BROWN:  I love you, Julie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... Democratic sides certainly more you know.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  But Julie, what did you think about the fact that -- I was struck  when we mentioned this earlier about Peter Thiel getting up and saying you  know that, \"I'm gay.  I'm Republican.  I'm American\".  And also both Ivanka  and Mr. Trump referenced LGBTQ and getting it right at 6 a.m. in the  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Referenced those rights.  So we've never heard that on the  Republican stage before.  So, someone who attended the Big Tent Brunch this  week, I was really excited to hear that coming from the stage.  Do you  think that maybe that applied to millennial voters at all?</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I love it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And independents.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yeah, listen.  I love it.  I think it's about high time that we  have both parties in this country join in supporting the LGBT community and  opportunities for them.  Yeah, to the extent that you reconcile it with the  Republican platform that was passed earlier last week which essentially was  probably the most regressive in terms of LGBT issues in the history of the  party.  It consistently spoke out against everything that Peter Thiel was  talking about that even that Donald Trump was talking about.</p><p>So you've got these two strains in the party that need to be reconciled.   But to the extent that millions of people were watching Peter Thiel and  Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump appeared to our better angels and the part of  the LGBT community, I think it was a very, very positive step in such a  difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Morgan, from 2004 when -- if you remember a lot of what the  Republican Party did to win that race was run against gay marriage in  places like Ohio, it's very refreshing to see 12 years later how much the  party has verbally shifted on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, we certainly know where Trump is, much more to the middle  than all the way on the right.  Mercedes, good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, Julie again it would be always a pleasure.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Thanks very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks everybody.  We will see you soon.</p><p>Coming up next, Cleveland police declaring a safe end to the convention,  with a surprisingly few numbers of arrest, more on the efforts to keep  convention attendees safe.  That's next.</p><p>And then the government spending billions to subsidize your junk food,  guilty pleasures.  The shocking numbers straight ahead.  Back in a minute  live from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, Cleveland Police reporting relatively few arrests  at the Republican National Convention this week.</p><p>With Cheryl Casone at our New York Headquarters with the headlines and  more.  Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEW CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>Well, after all the concerns about violence in a week of protests, there  have only been about 23 arrests.  But Cleveland's Police Chief says, still  that is too many.  There were concerns that the city would see an extreme  amount of protest and arrest following the recent shootings across the  country.  Thousands of police officers were deployed to keep everyone safe  in Cleveland.  Looks like they have succeeded.</p><p>Well, in business headlines this morning, stock to watch, General Motors.   The company may have to recall millions of more vehicles because of  defective Takata airbags.  GMs says federal regulators may force them to  recall 4.3 million more vehicles and additional cost of $550 million.</p><p>In May, GM recalled almost 2 million vehicles because of the airbag problem  and expanded the recall to another 600,000 in the month of June.</p><p>And finally this, despite the Government's healthy food initiatives, the  federal Government apparently has been heavily subsidizing the fast food  industry.</p><p>The New York Times reports from 1995 to 2010 the Government spent -- get  this, $170 billion in agricultural subsidies to produce ingredients that  make chunk food cheaper.  This is as report from the Centers for Disease  and Control Prevention shows that only a small fraction of federal  subsidies actually support fresh produce production.</p><p>By the way, Maria, Congress renews the farm bill every five years.  They  may want to take a closer look at this particular part of their spending  bill.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, not over yet.  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Coming up  next, customers still passing on Chipotle's Burritos, details on the  company's struggle to convince customers to move past that e-coli outbreak.</p><p>And then Facebook taking flight, the social media giant's internet beaming  drone making its maiden voyage more on the company's plan to bring internet  to remote parts of the world.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, markets are looking higher today.  Take a look.   Dow Jones Industry leverage up, that's 30 points right now in terms of  futures, looking at a pretty good open.  Markets are digesting mixed second  quarter results this week.  That certainly has been the driver.  Chipotle,  for one, reporting disappointing second quarter numbers after the bell last  night.  It is still struggling to regain its footing following the food  safety concerns.  Joining us right now, Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist Michael Block in New York.  Michael, good to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS, LLC:  Great to see  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the earning season so far? </p><p>BLOCK:  You know, earning season, you know, we'll talk about Chipotle last  night, but really, expectations were really low, Maria.  The bar was really  low and, you know, coming into it last night, you had something of over  three quarters of the companies that reported, surpassed the expectations.   Those expectations were a lot lower.  Take a company like Goldman Sachs,  everyone was excited that they beat analyst estimates for their second  quarter.  However, those numbers have been lower substantially where they  had come from.  It was really inline numbers, and not a question as what's  good, what's bad.  The point is, the bar was low they were exceeding it.   Now, in the case of Chipotle, they weren't really exceeding it and I think  that's something that's interesting here in terms of looking at that  company, but looking at the U.S. consumer as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah and that's an individual story.  But you know, as always,  digging it's always the guidance.  So, what are we hearing from companies  about the rest of the year?  Has that been better than expected?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In some instances and I'm curios what Michael thinks about  because again, your winners have been in technology to a certain extent.   But what about these sectors that look very expensive at this point and I  think technology would be one of them, right, Mike? </p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, technology that, you know, again, it comes down to it's  always a tale of two cities, who is winning and who is losing, and what are  the expectations here?  Take the other night, a great example of what I'm  talking about.  You had Intel and Qualcomm reporting.  There was a lot of  excitement going into Intel.  People were excited about this growth in the  server business, the cloud business, if you will.  And maybe they fell a  little bit short of expectations in the stock as accordingly as compared to  Qualcomm where there's concerns about mobile growth, lo and behold.  The  bar was low, they vaulted over it, the stock traded better.  Last night you  had -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I sure did. It was up 8 percent that was the best, right?</p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, look at that, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that helped the NASDAQ, NASDAQ hit a record high yesterday  following a week of record highs for the other two major indices.  So, like  you said, it really is technology and that's why you had the NASDAQ doing  so well yesterday. </p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, well, as that no -- so you know, biotech has got a nice,  little, stealthy run.  It gets left for dead and then it walks back because  people, growth investors, need to find a growth somewhere.  Where did they  find it?  They're not finding it in industrials.  They're not finding it in  utilities.  They're going to find it in areas like biotech.  So, that's  where the opportunity's big.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I still think that there are no story which broke last year's,  scared a lot of people out of biotechnology companies. </p><p>BLOCK:  Sure, it's a big boy game.  You have to really know what you're  doing.  You can quietly enter duty stocks but, you know, for the talented  bottoms up biotech experts, there's a lot of opportunity out there.  Now,  last night, we had Chipotle but we also had Star Bucks not doing so well,  and we also had Capital One which is the bank, but it's a proxy play on the  U.S. consumer, not doing as well there.  What does that all mean?  We've  had advanced retail sales numbers looking better, some U.S. economic data  looking better, but what are those companies telling us?  Star Bucks can't  get over a relatively high bar.  What does that tell us?  Capital One, what  does that tell us?  Next week we are going to have Apple, we're going to  have Amazon, and Alphabet, A.K.A. Google, some very big tech names.  Now,  if tech has been the driver, can that continue?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to do before that?  As an investor, what are  you going to do ahead of Apple, Google and these big tech names? </p><p>BLOCK:  Again, everything has its time and price.  If expectation is going  to Apple a little guarded, maybe that tells you that the -- you know, that  everyone's leading the wrong way and that the bar is lower.  They can give  some good color in upcoming products, they can give color on margins.   Maybe that's all the stock needs.  And Apple is also very well known for  sandbagging their guidance and I think that's built into expectations as  well.  Google, everyone is excited about the ad platform.  Everyone is so,  you know, worried about at -- But then there's some worry about regulation,  the European commission cracking down on them, can they get expectations  there?  As for Amazon, I hear over and over again, this is a thousand  dollar stock, everyone loves it, they dominate retail.  That's a high bar  to get over and that valuation matters in that company but, you know, I've  heard a lot of bullish arguments there.  So that number better be good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is Amazon going to -- is anybody going to look at valuation on  Amazon?  I mean, that has been the story in retail to buy, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anytime anybody says valuation isn't important, then it will  suddenly become important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And regardless of whatever metric you use to value it.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, and that's what it comes down to with.  I can make the  argument that that be carved out the cloud business.  We're going to do  businesses separately.  People have said, hey, that business is cheap.   I've actually heard that argument.  We don't have time to get into it here,  but suffice to say, that's the mentality out there.  So it tells you about  expectations from the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.  Jeff Bezos keeps knocking to cover up the ball,  Michael, good to see you my friend.  We'll see you back in New York.   Michael Block there.</p><p>BLOCK:  All right.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead, the Democratic National Convention has not even started  but the speaker list is already sparking outrage from police.  We will tell  you why.  Stay with us on that and then Donald Trump officially expecting  the Presidential nomination with the message of law and order.  We will get  Congressman Gohmert's highlights from last night, coming up.  Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the Republican National Convention in  Cleveland, Ohio, once again, here is Maria BARTIROMO.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  I am Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, July 22nd.  We are coming to you live from the  Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>First though your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the east coast, it is  official, Donald Trump formally accepting the Republican Party's nomination  for president of the United States last night.  The acceptance the end of a  big night that included a speech from Trump's daughter, Ivanka.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER:  Come January 2017 all things will  be possible again, we can hope and dream and sink big again.  No one has  more faith in the American people in my father.  He will be your greatest,  truest, and most loyal champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland Hillary  Clinton looking to make waves ahead of the Democratic convention next week.   She is expected to name her vice presidential pick today at an event in  Florida.</p><p>Plus a Russian warplane reportedly bombing a secret U.S. military base in  Syria.  The latest on the escalating global tensions.</p><p>The future of crime-fighting, why police in Michigan are turning to 3D  printing to solve a case.</p><p>Pandora reportedly tunes out a takeover bid, the decision that is weighing  on stock ahead of the open this morning.</p><p>Plus Facebook's drone taking flight, the stunning images of its maiden  voyage.</p><p>Markets this morning indicating a higher opening.  Futures are looking good  after snapping a nine-day trading win streak yesterday.</p><p>We are waiting earnings from big names like General Electric and Honeywell.   They may very well set the tone next week, big week for tech.</p><p>In Europe, markets are searching for direction this morning.  Investors are  watching manufacturing data out of the Eurozone.  The purchasing manager's  index coming in slightly above expectations but not enough to move market,  though.  DAX index in Germany down a fraction.  The FT 100 up about 20  points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower led by Japan's Nikkei average, which  was down over 1 percent.</p><p>With the Republican National Convention wrapping up, it is now the  Democrats turn, Philadelphia gearing up for the Democratic National  Convention next week.</p><p>That is where we find, Fox News' Doug McKelway.  Doug, good morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Good morning, Maria.  How are you doing?  I think  this is your first live shot out of the city of Philadelphia.  So glad to  be kicking things off here.</p><p>They are in the final stages of preparation.  Things are going fast and  furiously around here as they put the finishing touches on the Wells Fargo  Center.  In fact, they are going to be unveiling the arena and the floor  inside the arena within the next 15 minutes or so.</p><p>So we will be rushing over as a live shot is done.  I got a sneak peek of  it last night, no cameras allowed.  It's an impressive site indeed.</p><p>Philadelphia, the city itself also in the last stages of preparation as  they expect a number of demonstrators, many of which will be occurring in  FDR Park, which is a block to my right.  Things could get a little bit  tense here as they did at the Republican convention.</p><p>Manhole covers have been sealed shut, extra surveillance cameras and  chemical detectors have been put in place and all trucks over 5 tons have  been prohibited from using Interstate 95 in close proximity of the Wells  Fargo Center.</p><p>In fact, all traffic will be blocked off in the immediate vicinity of the  Wells Fargo Center.  The convention itself offers -- promises to offer as  stark a contrast to the Republican convention as anything we have seen in  generations.</p><p>And one clue to that is a tweet that Hillary Clinton sent out last night  just after midnight after Donald Trump had completed his speech.  Her tweet  said and I quote, \"I am with you @realdonaldtrump.  Not included women,  African-Americans, LGBT people, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants.\"</p><p>So the battle lines are drawn, Maria.  Another indication of how stark  those battle lines are now is a group of people who will be speaking here  on Tuesday night.  This is a group that's known as the Mothers of the  Movement.</p><p>It includes the mother of Eric Garner, the mother of Trayvon Martin and the  mother of Michael Brown, the young African-American who was shot by a  police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, which helped to set off so much of  the tension, which exists in this country.</p><p>Recall that the major theme in Donald Trump's speech last night was law and  order.  We are going to be hearing a very, very stark contrast to that at  the Democratic convention here at the Wells Fargo Center.  Back to you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug, thanks so much.  We'll check in as news  develops there.  Joining us right now is Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert.   Congressman, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  Are you  expecting Hillary to announce her VP pick today and who do you think?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  The truth is I don't really care.   It just doesn't matter.  She is going to be at the top ticket and that I  think the vice president in her case really is irrelevant.</p><p>In Trump's case it made a difference.  He is a big risk taker, which always  helps for foreign policy.  When \"Saturday Night Live (inaudible) where is  the red button?  That was great because your enemies need to think you are  unpredictable and that is why Trump will make a terrific president when it  comes to foreign affairs.</p><p>But with Hillary Clinton, I mean, come on.  It just doesn't matter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think that's right.  I mean, people are voting.  When  they vote, they are going to vote for Hillary Clinton if they want -- they  are not going to vote for her VP pick whereas Trump's pick for the VP was  much more important.  Isn't that right, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT BROWN, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR:  Absolutely.  The stability he  offers -- with Pence he brought in the constitutional conservatives.  He  actually bridged the gap between leadership being a former congressman and  knowing his way and the ability to pass legislation and that executive  experience as a governor.</p><p>Let me ask you something, Congressman, so obviously Ted and what he said  the night before, how is that affecting your delegation -- I mean, I've  heard from many Texans, who were saying, you know what, he shouldn't have  done it.  We are really one party.</p><p>It's really not about Ted or Kasich.  It's about the party and the  direction of our country.  What are your thoughts?</p><p>GOHMERT:  I have gotten a lot of mixed readings from so many of the Texans  about backing Texas, getting messages, and from people up here, but a lot  of people were disappointed.  Brian Kilmead (ph) was just giving me a hard  time.</p><p>I told him before the speech, Ted is so intelligent, this is going to be  very well thought out and bring us together.  It was interesting.  But you  know something else, Scott, I've heard from people who are devout  Christians going wow, Trump comes out looking like he is the forgiving one.   That is not exactly what some Christians were hoping for.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Looking back at the last week, are people  going to -- because Trump still has to worry about getting 90 percent of  Republican voters and he has been somewhere in kind of the mid to high 70  percent range at least in some of the recent polls.</p><p>Will people look back at the last week, will they remember the Melania  Trump snafu or will they remember Ted Cruz or are they going to remember  last night?</p><p>GOHMERT:  The Melania Trump snafu, I don't talk to anybody who even thinks  about the Melania Trump snafu.  There is no way they'll remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My mother brought it up on the phone, what the heck happened  there?</p><p>GOHMERT:  People that read the \"Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times,\"  they really spend a lot of time on it.</p><p>BROWN:  And if you want to talk about speeches, let's talk about the 21  million Hillary got the fact that she has not released any of the  transcripts from her speeches with Wall Street because with respect, those  speeches that she's probably doing the wink, wink, nod, nod.  Hey, listen,  you guys give me all your money and I'll take care of you when I get  elected.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to my point that Trump still coming into this week had to  worry about winning over some Republicans who are still on the sidelines.</p><p>GOHMERT:  But to think Trump had going for him is all about comparison.   And Maria, I know that's why you had me on the show.  You need to look at  Trump, the bar he had to clear, McCain, Romney, he was glowing last night  in comparison.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Romney got no bump after his convention in 2012.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Trump is getting a bump, right?  I mean, this is helping.</p><p>GOHMERT:  Who was he talking to?  Unlike the Democratic convention, they  are going to be talking to all of those that they are giving benefits.   Trump was talking to all the people across America, the middle-class that  are paying the way for everybody else, that made it a really strong speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, the DNC released the list of speakers, and now we know  that Hillary has invited the families of those lost African-Americans, but  she didn't invite the families of the police who were shot -- </p><p>GOHMERT:  Are you telling me that Hillary is going to have 2,000 parents  from Chicago whose kids were shot on the street?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She has some of the families are on the speaker list.</p><p>GOHMERT:  You are talking about all those that have been killing each other  on the streets of Chicago.  Those are the true victims.  Those are the  black lives matter that people aren't talking about, on the streets of  Chicago, the streets of Washington, D.C, where there is so much gun control  and yet you have 2,000 people shot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to look like she is politicizing this?</p><p>BROWN:  Of course, she politicizes everything, that is Democratic playbook  101 is to divide and conquer, us versus them, the \"have\" and the \"have  not,\" 99 percent, 1 percent, they divide so they keep everybody fighting  and pick them off one by one.</p><p>You will see such a contrast of what we saw here and I think the Occupy  Wall Street and moveon.org and Black Lives Matter, they are not happy with  Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders selling out to the queen of Wall Street  and there will be hell to pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about Trump's speech because it was so anticipated  at the convention.  Donald Trump accepting the nomination obviously and  laying out his plans for Trump administration.  Listen to this, want to get  your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have a message for all of you,  the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, I mean,  very soon, come to an end.  Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will  be restored.  Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of  the United States are enforced.  We are going to be considerate and  compassionate to everyone, but my greatest compassion will be for our own  struggling citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did the message resonate?  What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>GOHMERT:  I think he resonated loud and clear.  The sensitivity to what is  really bothering Americans was born out, who talked about the TSA needing  fixed?  Americans traveling are so sick of the TSA and the way he plugs  that in is on Middle America's radar but Hillary won't notice that.</p><p>He has a private plane and yet he still knows what is really bothering  people these days.  One thing you won't hear from Republicans after Hillary  brings victims' families, you won't hear unlike Hillary you won't hear  Republicans say what difference at this point does it make because people  are very sensitive on the Republican side to the violence except we don't  want to pander, we want to fix the problem.  I love hearing that from  Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you know, it's interesting, the party -- they don't  necessarily like each other.  I mean, a lot of people are holding their  nose saying I will get in line.  Republicans can't do that.  They don't  just fake it.</p><p>GOHMERT:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You saw that in the blues on Wednesday nights.  One criticism of  the speech last night, 75 minutes is too long.  When you go past 11:00 at  night that is a problem.  A commute and a speech should never be longer  than 60 minutes.</p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, except he may have messed up in looking to build Clinton  for the proper length of the speech.  Hillary will have -- the built her  husband, didn't have.</p><p>I was asking the clerk, who retired a few years ago, what is the most  memorable thing that happened during in your time?  And he said it was Bill  Clinton's state of the union address where the teleprompter didn't work and  he got a number of applause lines because he was winging it.</p><p>And he turned around, and I asked Stephanopoulos, he said this is  absolutely true, he said he turned around to Al Gore, facing Al Gore,  Stephanopoulos is on the wing, and he said they got the wrong speech on the  teleprompter.</p><p>And turned back smiling, and Stephanopoulos runs out, gets them to punch  out the cd and it turned out they had the year before state of the union.   They spent much of the speech -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is an episode -- </p><p>GOHMERT:  That was Bill Clinton.  Hillary can't do that.</p><p>BROWN:  It's not Bill Clinton's party anymore, Maria, sorry to jump on you.   It's not Bill Clinton's party anymore or JFK's -- so it's so true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Louie Gohmert, good to see you.  Thank you so much,  sir.  Great to have you.  Appreciate it very much.  We'll take a short  break.</p><p>Then criminals could prove to be no match for scientists.  Straight ahead,  how a lab in Michigan is using 3D printing to help police catch a murderer.</p><p>Starbucks customers become disloyal after changes to its loyalty program,  breaking its 25 quarter growth streak.  More on that coming up next.  Back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Russian fighter jets targeting a Syrian outpost  used by the U.S. military.  Cheryl Casone with the story and the headlines  now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  That's right, Maria.  Good morning.  Well,  alert sirens went off at the Pentagon last month after U.S. officials say  the base near the Jordanian border, which is used by American and British  Special Forces with hit by missile fire.</p><p>Turns out the outpost was bombed by Russian warplanes.  After the first  strike, the U.S. military reached out to the Russian air campaign  headquarters in Syria saying the base should not be attacked, but Russian  jets hit it again about 90 minutes later.  Four Syrian rebel troops were  killed in those airstrikes, we should say.  British troops had just left  the base one day before.</p><p>Here at home police in Michigan are working with a 3D printing lab to try  and catch a killer.  The lab is working to, get this, recreate the fingers  of a murder victim.</p><p>With those prints they hope to unlock the victim's iPhone, which might  include clues to who killed him.  The lab is using a set of fingerprints  from the victim that were taken during an unrelated prior arrest.   Technicians at the lab hope to use the 3D fingers to bypass the biometric  lock that is on the dead man's iPhone.</p><p>And finally this, Facebook's drone has completed its first test flight in  Arizona.  The solar powered drone which a wingspan of a Boeing 737 lifted  off the runway at a military installation in Arizona yesterday.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg was there on site to witness it.  The drone was airborne  for about 90 minutes, more than three times longer than Facebook, and you  can see Mr. Zuckerberg celebrating the victory for his company.</p><p>You know what, Maria, this is interesting.  Facebook plans to use the drone  to deliver faster internet service to billions of people that who don't  have it.  Think, Maria, about other continents in particular like Africa.   But again, Mark Zuckerberg, big celebration in Arizona for him yesterday  with that drone.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  We're going to take a short  break.  We will be right back with highlights from this week's special  coverage of the Republican National Convention.

We want to show of the highlights from our great guests this  week.

Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  S&amp;P 500 sectors ending the week mixed and technology  leading driven by solid earnings from eBay up 13 percent and Qualcomm up 9  percent.  Energy, the biggest drag, supply concerns sent oil sliding almost  3 percent for the week.  So Maria, obviously it has been a decent week for  our markets.
