These what-have-we-wrought manifestos - Evgeny Morozov's \"The Net Delusion,\" Jaron Lanier's \"You Are Not a Gadget,\" Nicholas Carr's \"The Shallows,\" to name but a few - are a chorus line of King Canutes yelling, largely in vain, against the incoming tide of insidious data mining, surveillance economies, endangered jobs and smartphone addiction. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest volume to wash up on the rocky shores of doubt is \"How to Fix the Future\" by Andrew Keen, an entrepreneur turned technology pundit. Published close on the heels of his 2015 curmudgeonly treatise, \"The Internet Is Not the Answer,\" Keen's new book is far less grumpy, as the author trains his lens on tools he believes can help correct our course. </p><p>The title is a bit off. Forget the future. The book is a courageous attempt to offer some constructive solutions to a world already filled with monoliths that make the Microsoft of the 1990s, whose hegemony we once feared so much that the government saw fit to break it into pieces, look like a humble Etsy vendor. </p><p>Keen is mercifully brief with his indictments of big tech. Just in case you need it, a quick refresher: Uber isn't merely exploiting its drivers but working overtime to render them unnecessary. Amazon (whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post) has tentacles in pretty much everything, including health care and education. Apple's iPhone is turning us all into zombies. Facebook, conduit of fake news, is a crime scene. And just try to go 15 minutes without using something of Google's.</p><p>So what do we do? Keen asks, reasonably enough. </p><p>Keen offers a five-part solution, consisting of greater consumer choice, social responsibility, competitive innovation, smart regulation and enlightened education. At the center, not surprisingly, is humanity itself. </p><p>In his search for the humans who are playing key roles in preserving the fundamentals of a civilized society, Keen does something admirable: He hits the road, interviewing dozens of folks around the world who are doing - and saying -  interesting, innovative things. </p><p>He visits the chief technology officer of Estonia, the first country in the world to offer \"e-residency,\" an electronic passport that allows any small-business owner to use a variety of Estonian services and technologies. Intended as an antithesis to the \"dark web,\" the country is reimagining cyberspace as civic space, Keen reports. </p><p>Then there's Singapore, one of the most wired countries on the planet, where Keen explores the Smart Nation initiative, whose goal, as its politicians would have us believe, is to reinvent Singapore so that digitized information becomes the foundation of a new public space for civic innovation. Writes Keen, \"The plan is to erect an electronic mirror that will enable [Singapore] to become ever more self aware.\" </p><p>So rosy is Keen's tone in parts that I was put in mind of a wide-eyed, if craggy-faced, 21st-century Dorothy, picking up valuable lessons on her way to Oz.</p><p>It was when Keen got to Singapore that I began to wonder if he might be looking for solutions in the wrong places. Singapore? I mean, I'd like to see cleaner sidewalks as much as the next San Franciscan, but doesn't Singapore take things a tad too far? As Keen himself points out, human and free-speech rights champions, to say nothing of privacy advocates, aren't whistling Dixie with their worries over what Singapore might have in mind with its deployment of sensors and cameras across the island.</p><p>And the notion of e-citizenry, while fascinating, seems of questionable applicability to the United States. </p><p>Still, I came away from Keen's world travels grateful to him for enduring all those endless flights to far-flung places so we wouldn't have to.</p><p>Keen's trip to Brussels makes more sense. There he meets with Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, who is bravely standing up to the likes of Google and Apple. Vestager imposed a 13 billion-euro fine on Apple in back taxes for the company's dodgy tax arrangements with Ireland. And she has set her antitrust sights on Google. Last year, she fined the company a record 2.42\u00a0billion euros for giving preferential treatment to Google Shopping, its price comparison service. </p><p>\"How to Fix the Future\" has its share of annoyances. The phrase \"you'll remember,\" to remind us of someone or something he has mentioned plenty of times already, sometimes quite recently, becomes a distracting literary tic. </p><p>And there are mistakes. Some are easily forgiven. I can see getting Angela Merkel's name wrong (which Keen does); after all, the German prime minister isn't a constant presence in Keen's Silicon Valley-centric world. But misspelling the first names of Sergey Brin and Marc Benioff is just plain inexcusable. And an Internet expert like Keen should know that science fiction writer William Gibson coined the word \"cyberspace\" not in his 1984 novel, \"Neuromancer,\" but two years earlier in his short story \"Burning Chrome.\"</p><p>Eventually our Dorothy returns to Kansas, which in Keen's case is his own back yard of Oakland, Calif. He describes with great admiration work being done by Freada Kapor Klein, a longtime tech activist. Together with her husband, Mitch Kapor, she has created a workspace in Oakland that blends high tech with humanism. Working to ensure that everyone gets a chance at a tech career, the couple invests in start-ups whose founders are women or people of color, and they've started a program that funnels underprivileged kids into math and science.  All of this, as Keen puts it, is a \"counterweight to Silicon Valley's most corrosive indifference to the impact of its disruption on the world around it.\" Well put, and a brave ambition for a scary new world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-b82ebe6e232511e886f654bfff693d2b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTY-V581-JB4M-V37J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><timeReceived>5:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 9, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000A4JV</classCode><className>INDICTMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBQzg5RTRGNTcwNDVFOEFDRjJFODQwOTc3NTFFOEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFFNkY3ODg0ODk4NEEwNTk4Q0RDNUQwMUI4NzgzMkM</classCode><className>Indictments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAKE NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp;

These what-have-we-wrought manifestos - Evgeny Morozov's \"The Net Delusion,\" Jaron Lanier's \"You Are Not a Gadget,\" Nicholas Carr's \"The Shallows,\" to name but a few - are a chorus line of King Canutes yelling, largely in vain, against the incoming tide of insidious data mining, surveillance economies, endangered jobs and smartphone addiction.</p><p>The latest volume to wash up on the rocky shores of doubt is \"How to Fix the Future\" by Andrew Keen, an entrepreneur turned technology pundit. Published close on the heels of his 2015 curmudgeonly treatise, \"The Internet Is Not the Answer,\" Keen's new book is far less grumpy, as the author trains his lens on tools he believes can help correct our course.</p><p>The title is a bit off. Forget the future. The book is a courageous attempt to offer some constructive solutions to a world already filled with monoliths that make the Microsoft of the 1990s, whose hegemony we once feared so much that the government saw fit to break it into pieces, look like a humble Etsy vendor.</p><p>Keen is mercifully brief with his indictments of big tech. Just in case you need it, a quick refresher: Uber isn't merely exploiting its drivers but working overtime to render them unnecessary. Amazon (whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post) has tentacles in pretty much everything, including health care and education. Apple's iPhone is turning us all into zombies. Facebook, conduit of fake news, is a crime scene. And just try to go 15 minutes without using something of Google's.</p><p>So what do we do? Keen asks, reasonably enough.</p><p>Keen offers a five-part solution, consisting of greater consumer choice, social responsibility, competitive innovation, smart regulation and enlightened education. At the center, not surprisingly, is humanity itself.</p><p>In his search for the humans who are playing key roles in preserving the fundamentals of a civilized society, Keen does something admirable: He hits the road, interviewing dozens of folks around the world who are doing - and saying - interesting, innovative things.</p><p>He visits the chief technology officer of Estonia, the first country in the world to offer \"e-residency,\" an electronic passport that allows any small-business owner to use a variety of Estonian services and technologies. Intended as an antithesis to the \"dark web,\" the country is reimagining cyberspace as civic space, Keen reports.</p><p>Then there's Singapore, one of the most wired countries on the planet, where Keen explores the Smart Nation initiative, whose goal, as its politicians would have us believe, is to reinvent Singapore so that digitized information becomes the foundation of a new public space for civic innovation. Writes Keen, \"The plan is to erect an electronic mirror that will enable [Singapore] to become ever more self aware.\"</p><p>So rosy is Keen's tone in parts that I was put in mind of a wide-eyed, if craggy-faced, 21st-century Dorothy, picking up valuable lessons on her way to Oz.</p><p>It was when Keen got to Singapore that I began to wonder if he might be looking for solutions in the wrong places. Singapore? I mean, I'd like to see cleaner sidewalks as much as the next San Franciscan, but doesn't Singapore take things a tad too far? As Keen himself points out, human and free-speech rights champions, to say nothing of privacy advocates, aren't whistling Dixie with their worries over what Singapore might have in mind with its deployment of sensors and cameras across the island.</p><p>And the notion of e-citizenry, while fascinating, seems of questionable applicability to the United States.</p><p>Still, I came away from Keen's world travels grateful to him for enduring all those endless flights to far-flung places so we wouldn't have to.</p><p>Keen's trip to Brussels makes more sense. There he meets with Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, who is bravely standing up to the likes of Google and Apple. Vestager imposed a 13 billion-euro fine on Apple in back taxes for the company's dodgy tax arrangements with Ireland. And she has set her antitrust sights on Google. Last year, she fined the company a record 2.42 billion euros for giving preferential treatment to Google Shopping, its price comparison service.</p><p>\"How to Fix the Future\" has its share of annoyances. The phrase \"you'll remember,\" to remind us of someone or something he has mentioned plenty of times already, sometimes quite recently, becomes a distracting literary tic.</p><p>And there are mistakes. Some are easily forgiven. I can see getting Angela Merkel's name wrong (which Keen does); after all, the German prime minister isn't a constant presence in Keen's Silicon Valley-centric world. But misspelling the first names of Sergey Brin and Marc Benioff is just plain inexcusable. And an internet expert like Keen should know that science fiction writer William Gibson coined the word \"cyberspace\" not in his 1984 novel, \"Neuromancer,\" but two years earlier in his short story \"Burning Chrome.\"</p><p>Eventually our Dorothy returns to Kansas, which in Keen's case is his own backyard of Oakland, Calif. He describes with great admiration work being done by Freada Kapor Klein, a longtime tech activist. Together with her husband, Mitch Kapor, she has created a workspace in Oakland that blends high tech with humanism. Working to ensure that everyone gets a chance at a tech career, the couple invests in start-ups whose founders are women or people of color, and they've started a program that funnels underprivileged kids into math and science. All of this, as Keen puts it, is a \"counterweight to Silicon Valley's most corrosive indifference to the impact of its disruption on the world around it.\" Well put, and a brave ambition for a scary new world.</p><p>Hafner is a journalist and author whose books include \"Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet\" (with Matthew Lyon).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-571479</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWV-3TX1-JBM5-P02W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 18, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000A4JV</classCode><className>INDICTMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBQzg5RTRGNTcwNDVFOEFDRjJFODQwOTc3NTFFOEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFFNkY3ODg0ODk4NEEwNTk4Q0RDNUQwMUI4NzgzMkM</classCode><className>Indictments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAKE NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DLCR</classCode><className>RIDE SHARING SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000444</classCode><className>DATA MINING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DI5R</classCode><className>HIDDEN WEB</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009VUU</classCode><className>JEFFREY P BEZOS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GC571</classCode><className>ESTONIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

AMZN recently noted to a spike in demand for household staples and essentials, and for its Amazon Web Services offerings (video conferencing, remote leaning, online health), with about 175,000 added headcount and 60%+ increase in its grocery delivery capacity, while shifting to  one-day delivery, with likely continued strong growth in its global Prime membership of 150,000+.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MDNTRD-A2224785</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MDNTRD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FP-BY21-DY03-M2F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">263815</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"196\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MT Newswires Live Briefs</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13222\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Many AI experts (including Jeff Dean, head of AI at Google, and Andrew Ng, founder of Coursera and deeplearning.ai) say that warnings about sentient robots are overblown, but other harms are not getting enough attention. I agree. I am an AI researcher, and I'm worried about some of the societal impacts that we're already seeing.</p><p><br/>Before we dive in, I need to clarify one point that is important to understand:\u00a0algorithms (and the complex systems they are a part of) can make mistakes. These mistakes come from a variety of sources: bugs in the code, inaccurate or biased data, approximations we have to make (e.g. you want to measure health and you use hospital readmissions as a proxy, or you are interested in crime and use arrests as a proxy. These things are related, but not the same), misunderstandings between different stakeholders (policy makers, those collecting the data, those coding the algorithm, those deploying it), how computer systems interact with human systems, and more.<br/>Algorithms are often implemented without ways to address mistakesAfter the state of Arkansas implemented software to determine people's healthcare benefits, many people saw a drastic reduction in the amount of care they received, but were given\u00a0no explanation and no way to appeal. Tammy Dobbs, a woman with cerebral palsy who needs an aid to help her to get out of bed, to go to the bathroom, to get food, and more, had her hours of help suddenly reduced by 20 hours a week, transforming her life for the worse. Eventually,\u00a0a lengthy court case uncovered errors\u00a0in the software implementation, and Tammy's hours were restored (along with those of many others who were impacted by the errors).<br/>Observations of fifth grade teacher Sarah Wysocki's classroom yielded positive reviews. Her\u00a0assistant principal wrote, \"It is a pleasure to visit a classroom in which the elements of sound teaching, motivated students and a positive learning environment are so effectively combined.\" Two months later,\u00a0she was fired by an opaque algorithm, along with over 200 other teachers. The head of the PTA and a parent of one of Wyscoki's students described her as \"One of the best teachers I've ever come in contact with. Every time I saw her, she was attentive to the children, went over their schoolwork, she took time with them and made sure.\" That people are losing needed healthcare without an explanation or being fired without explanation is truly dystopian!<br/>As I covered in a previous post,people use outputs from algorithms differently than they usedecisions made by humans:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Algorithms are more likely to be implemented with\u00a0no appeals process\u00a0in place.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Algorithms are often used\u00a0at scale.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Algorithmic systems are\u00a0cheap.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>People are more likely to assume algorithms are\u00a0objective or error-free. As\u00a0Peter Haas said, \"In AI, we have Milgram's ultimate authority figure,\" referring to Stanley Milgram's\u00a0famous experiments\u00a0showing that most people will obey orders from authority figures, even to the point of harming or killing other humans. How much more likely will people be to trust algorithms perceived as objective and correct?</p></bodyText></listItem></list>There is a lot of overlap between these factors. If the main motivation for implementing an algorithm is cost-cutting, adding an appeals process (or even diligently checking for errors) may be considered an \"unnecessary\" expense. Cathy O'Neill, who earned her math PhD at Harvard, wrote a book\u00a0Weapons of Math Destruction, in which she covers how algorithms are disproportionately impacting poor people, whereas the privileged are more likely to still have access to human attention (in hiring, education, and more).<br/>AI makes it easier to not feel responsibleLet's return to the case of the buggy software used to determine health benefits in Arkansas. How could this have been prevented? In order to prevent severely disabled people from mistakenly losing access to needed healthcare, we need to talk about responsibility. Unfortunately,\u00a0complex systems lend themselves to a dynamic in which nobody feels responsible for the outcome.<br/>The creator of the algorithm for healthcare benefits, Brant Fries (who has been earning royalties off this algorithm, which is in use in over half the 50 states), blamed state policy makers. I'm sure the state policy makers could blame the implementers of the software. When asked if there should be a way to communicate how the algorithm works to the disabled people losing their healthcare, Fries callously said, \"It's probably something we should do. Yeah, I also should probably dust under my bed,\" and then later clarified that he thought it was someone else's responsibility.<br/>This passing of the buck and failure to take responsibility is common in many bureaucracies. As danah boyd observed, Bureaucracy has often been used to shift or evade responsibility. Who do you hold responsible in a complex system?Boyd gives the examples of high-ranking bureaucrats in Nazi Germany, who did not see themselves as responsible for the Holocaust. Today's algorithmic systems are extending bureaucracy.<br/>Another example of nobody feeling responsible comes from the case of research to classify gang crime. A database of gang members assembled by the Los Angeles Police Department (and 3 other California law enforcement agencies) was found to have 42 babies who were under the age of 1 when added to the gang database (28 were said to have admitted to being gang members). Keep in mind these are just some of the most obvious errors- we don't know how many other people were falsely included. When researchers presented work on using machine learning on this data to classify gang crimes, an audience member\u00a0asked about ethical concerns. \"I'm just an engineer,\" responded one of the authors.<br/>I don't bring this up for the primary purpose of pointing fingers or casting blame. However, a world of complex systems in which nobody feels responsible for the outcomes (which can include severely disabled people losing access to the healthcare they need, or innocent people being labeled as gang members) is not a pleasant place.\u00a0Our work is almost always a small piece of a larger whole, yet a sense of responsibility is necessary to try to address and prevent negative outcomes.<br/>AI encodes &amp; magnifies biasBut isn't algorithmic bias just a reflection of how the world is? I get asked a variation of this question\u00a0every time I give a talk about bias. To which my answer is: No, our algorithms and products impact the world and are part of feedback loops. Consider an algorithm to predict crime and determine where to send police officers: sending more police to a particular neighborhood is not just an effect, but also a cause. More police officers can lead to more arrests in a given neighborhood, which could cause the algorithm to send even more police to that neighborhood (a mechanism described in this paper on runaway feedback loops).<br/>Bias is being encoded and even magnified in a variety of applications:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Software used to decide prison sentences that has twice as high a false positive rate for Black defendants as for white defendants</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Computer vision software from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM performs significantly worse on people of color</p></bodyText></listItem></list>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Word embeddings, which are a building block for language tools like Gmail's SmartReply and Google Translate, generate useful analogies such as Rome:Italy :: Madrid:Spain, as well as biased analogies such as man:computer programmer :: woman: homemaker.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Machine learning used in recruiting software developed at Amazon\u00a0penalized applicants who attended all-women's colleges, as well as any resumes that contained the word \"women's.\"</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Over 2/3 of the images in ImageNet, the most studied image data set in the world, are from the Western world (USA, England, Spain, Italy, Australia).</p></bodyText></listItem></list>\u00a0<br/>Since a Cambrian explosion of machine learning products is occurring, the biases that are calcified now and in the next few years may have a disproportionately huge impact for ages to come (and will be much harder to undo decades from now).<br/>Optimizing metrics above all else leads to negative outcomesWorldwide, people watch one billion hours of YouTube per day (yes, that says PER DAY). A large part of YouTube's success has been due to its recommendation system, in which a video selected by an algorithm automatically begin playing once the previous video is over. Unfortunately,\u00a0these recommendations\u00a0are disproportionately for conspiracy theories promoting\u00a0white supremacy, climate change denial, and\u00a0denial of the mass shootings\u00a0that plague the USA. What is going on? YouTube's algorithm is trying to\u00a0maximize how much time\u00a0people spend watching YouTube, and\u00a0conspiracy theorists watch significantly more YouTube than people who trust a variety of media sources. Unfortunately, a recommendation system trying only to maximize time spent on its own platform will incentivize content that tells you\u00a0the rest of the media is lying.<br/>\"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century,\" Professor\u00a0Zeynep Tufekci wrote in the New York Times.\u00a0Guillaume Chaslot\u00a0is a former YouTube engineer turned whistleblower. He has been outspoken about the harms caused by YouTube, and he\u00a0partnered with the Guardian\u00a0and the Wall Street Journal to study the extremism and bias in YouTube's recommendations.<br/>\u00a0<br/>YouTube is owned by Google, which is earning billions of dollars by aggressively introducing vulnerable people to conspiracy theories, while the rest of society bears the externalized costs of rising authoritarian governments, a resurgence in white supremacist movements, failure to act on climate change (even as extreme weather is creating increasing numbers of refugees), growing distrust of mainstream news sources, and a failure to pass sensible gun laws.<br/>This problem is an example of the tyranny of metrics: metrics are just a proxy for what you really care about, and unthinkingly optimizing a metric can lead to unexpected, negative results. One analog example is that when the UK began publishing the success rates of surgeons, heart surgeons began turning down risky (but necessary) surgeries to try to keep their scores as high as possible.<br/>Returning to the account of the popular 5th grade teacher who was fired by an algorithm, she suspects that the underlying reason she was fired was that her incoming students had unusually high test scores the previous year (making it seem like their scores had dropped to a more average level after her teaching), and that their former teachers may have cheated. As USA education policy began over-emphasizing student test scores as the primary way to evaluate teachers, there have been widespread scandals of teachers and principals cheating by altering students scores, in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Virginia, Texas, and elsewhere. When metrics are given undue importance, attempts to game those metrics become common.<br/>There is no accountability for big tech companiesMajor tech companies are the primary ones driving AI advances, and their algorithms impact billions of people. Unfortunately, these companies have zero accountability. YouTube (owned by Google) is helping to radicalize people into white supremacy. Google allowed advertisers to target people who search racist phrases like \"black people ruin neighborhoods\" and Facebook allowed advertisers to target groups like \"jew haters\". Amazon's facial recognition technology misidentified 28 members of congress as criminals, yet it is already in use by police departments. Palantir's predictive policing technology was used for 6 years in New Orleans, with city council members not even knowing about the program, much less having any oversight. The newsfeed/timeline/recommendation algorithms of all the major platforms tend to reward incendiary content, prioritizing it for users.<br/>In early 2018, the UN ruled that Facebook had played a \"determining role\" in the ongoing genocide in Myanmar. \"I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast,\" said the UN investigator. This result was not a surprise to anyone who had been following the situation in Myanmar. People warned Facebook executives about how the platform was being used to spread dehumanizing hate speech and incite violence against an ethnic minority as early as 2013, and again in 2014 and 2015. As early as 2014, news outlets such as\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0were covering Facebook's role in inciting ethnic violence in Myanmar.<br/>One person\u00a0close to the case\u00a0said, \"That's not 20/20 hindsight.

As of 2015, Facebook only\u00a0employed 4 contractors\u00a0who spoke Burmese (the primary language in Myanmar).<br/>Contrast Facebook's inaction in Myanmar with their swift action in Germany after the passage of a new law, which could have resulted in penalties of up to 50 million euros.\u00a0Facebook hired 1,200 German contractors\u00a0in under a year. In 2018, five years after Facebook was first warned about how they were being used to incite violence in Myanmar, they hired \"dozens\" of Burmese contractors, a fraction of their response in Germany. The\u00a0credible threat of a large financial penalty\u00a0may be the only thing Facebook responds to.<br/>While it can be easy to focus on regulations that are misguided or ineffective, we often take for granted safety standards and regulations that have largely worked well. One major success story comes from automobile safety. Early cars had sharp metal knobs on dashboard that lodged in people's skulls during crashes, plate glass windows that shattered dangerously, and non-collapsible steering columns that would frequently impale drivers. Beyond that, there was a widespread belief that the only issue with cars was the people driving them, and car manufactures did not want data on car safety to be collected. It took consumer safety advocates decades to push the conversation to how cars could be designed with greater safety, and to pass laws regarding seat belts, driver licenses, crash tests, and the collection of car crash data. For more on this topic, Datasheets for Datasets covers cases studies of how standardization came to the electronics, pharmaceutical, and automobile industries, and 99% Invisible has a deep dive on the history of car safety (with parallels and contrasts to the gun industry).<br/>Here's how we can do betterThe good news: none of the problems listed here are inherent to algorithms!

Technology is just a tool, and it can be used for good or bad. Let's work to use it for good, to improve the lives of many, rather than just generate wealth for a small number of people.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-459737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW3-JM31-JBYT-H4R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Many AI experts (includingJeff Dean[1], head of AI at Google, andAndrew Ng[2], founder of Coursera and deeplearning.ai) say that warnings about sentient robots are overblown, but other harms are not getting enough attention. I agree. I am an AI researcher, andI'm worried[3]about some of the societal impacts that we're already seeing. </p><p>Before we dive in, I need to clarify one point that is important to understand:algorithms (and the complex systems they are a part of) can make mistakes. These mistakes come from a variety of sources: bugs in the code, inaccurate or biased data, approximations we have to make (e.g. you want to measure health and you use hospital readmissions as a proxy, or you are interested in crime and use arrests as a proxy. These things are related, but not the same), misunderstandings between different stakeholders (policy makers, those collecting the data, those coding the algorithm, those deploying it), how computer systems interact with human systems, and more. Algorithms are often implemented without ways to address mistakes After the state ofArkansas implemented software[4]to determine people's healthcare benefits, many people saw a drastic reduction in the amount of care they received, but were givenno explanation and no way to appeal. Tammy Dobbs, a woman with cerebral palsy who needs an aid to help her to get out of bed, to go to the bathroom, to get food, and more, had her hours of help suddenly reduced by 20 hours a week, transforming her life for the worse. Eventually,a lengthy court case uncovered errorsin the software implementation, and Tammy's hours were restored (along with those of many others who were impacted by the errors). Observations of fifth grade teacher Sarah Wysocki's classroom yielded positive reviews. Herassistant principal wrote[5], 'It is a pleasure to visit a classroom in which the elements of sound teaching, motivated students and a positive learning environment are so effectively combined.' Two months later,she was fired by an opaque algorithm, along with over 200 other teachers. The head of the PTA and a parent of one of Wyscoki's students described her as 'One of the best teachers I've ever come in contact with. Every time I saw her, she was attentive to the children, went over their schoolwork, she took time with them and made sure.' That people are losing needed healthcare without an explanation or being fired without explanation is truly dystopian!<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Headlines\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Headlines</url> from The Verge and the Washington PostAs I covered in aprevious post[6],people use outputs from algorithms differently than they usedecisions made by humans: Algorithms are more likely to be implemented withno appeals processin place. Algorithms are often usedat scale. Algorithmic systems arecheap. People are more likely to assume algorithms areobjective or error-free. AsPeter Haas said[7], 'In AI, we have Milgram's ultimate authority figure,' referring to Stanley Milgram'sfamous experiments[8]showing that most people will obey orders from authority figures, even to the point of harming or killing other humans. How much more likely will people be to trust algorithms perceived as objective and correct? There is a lot of overlap between these factors. If the main motivation for implementing an algorithm is cost-cutting, adding an appeals process (or even diligently checking for errors) may be considered an 'unnecessary' expense. Cathy O'Neill, who earned her math PhD at Harvard, wrote a bookWeapons of Math Destruction[9], in which she covers how algorithms are disproportionately impacting poor people, whereas the privileged are more likely to still have access to human attention (in hiring, education, and more).AI makes it easier to not feel responsibleLet's return to the case of thebuggy software used to determine health benefits[10] in Arkansas. How could this have been prevented? In order to prevent severely disabled people from mistakenly losing access to needed healthcare, we need to talk about responsibility. Unfortunately,complex systems lend themselves to a dynamic in which nobody feels responsible for the outcome. The creator of the algorithm for healthcare benefits, Brant Fries (who has been earning royalties off this algorithm, which is in use in over half the 50 states), blamed state policy makers. I'm sure the state policy makers could blame the implementers of the software. When asked if there should be a way to communicate how the algorithm works to the disabled people losing their healthcare, Fries callously said, 'It's probably something we should do. Yeah, I also should probably dust under my bed,' and then later clarified that he thought it was someone else's responsibility. This passing of the buck and failure to take responsibility is common in many bureaucracies. Asdanah boyd observed[11],Bureaucracy has often been used to shift or evade responsibility. Who do you hold responsible in a complex system?Boyd gives the examples of high-ranking bureaucrats in Nazi Germany, who did not see themselves as responsible for the Holocaust.Today's algorithmic systems are extending bureaucracy. Another example of nobody feeling responsible comes from the case ofresearch to classify gang crime[12]. A database of gang members assembled by the Los Angeles Police Department (and 3 other California law enforcement agencies) wasfound to have 42 babies[13]who were under the age of 1 when added to the gang database (28 were said to have admitted to being gang members). Keep in mind these are just some of the most obvious errors- we don't know how many other people were falsely included. When researchers presented work on using machine learning on this data to classify gang crimes, an audience memberasked about ethical concerns[14]. 'I'm just an engineer,' responded one of the authors. I don't bring this up for the primary purpose of pointing fingers or casting blame. However, a world of complex systems in which nobody feels responsible for the outcomes (which can include severely disabled people losing access to the healthcare they need, or innocent people being labeled as gang members) is not a pleasant place.Our work is almost always a small piece of a larger whole, yet a sense of responsibility is necessary to try to address and prevent negative outcomes.AI encodes ...gnifies biasBut isn't algorithmic bias just a reflection of how the world is?I get asked a variation of this questionevery time[15]I give a[16]talk about bias[17]. To which my answer is: No,our algorithms and products impact the world and are part of feedback loops. Consider an algorithm to predict crime and determine where to send police officers: sending more police to a particular neighborhood isnot just an effect, but also a cause. More police officers can lead to more arrests in a given neighborhood, which could cause the algorithm to send even more police to that neighborhood (a mechanism described inthis paper[18]on runaway feedback loops). Bias is being encoded andeven magnified[19]in a variety of applications: Software used todecide prison sentences[20]that has twice as high a false positive rate for Black defendants as for white defendants Computer vision software fromAmazon[21],Microsoft, and IBM[22]performs significantly worse on people of color      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Research\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Research</url> by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru found that commercial computer vision software performed significantly worse on women with dark skin. Gendershades.org Word embeddings[23], which are a building block for language tools like Gmail's SmartReply and Google Translate, generate useful analogies such as Rome:Italy :: Madrid:Spain, as well asbiased analogies[24]such as man:computer programmer :: woman: homemaker. Machine learning used in recruiting software developed at Amazonpenalized applicants[25]who attended all-women's colleges, as well as any resumes that contained the word 'women's.' Over2/3 of the images in ImageNet[26], the most studied image data set in the world, are from the Western world (USA, England, Spain, Italy, Australia).      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Chart\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Chart</url> from 'No Classification without Representation' by Shankar, et. al, shows the origin of ImageNet photos: 45 percent US, 8 percent UK, 6 percent Italy, 3 percent Canada, 3 percent Australia, 3 percent SpainSince a Cambrian explosion of machine learning products is occurring, the biases that are calcified now and in the next few years may have a disproportionately huge impact for ages to come (and will be much harder to undo decades from now).Optimizing metrics above all else leads to negative outcomesWorldwide, people watchone billion hours of YouTube per day[27](yes, that says PER DAY). A large part of YouTube's success has been due to its recommendation system, in which a video selected by an algorithm automatically begin playing once the previous video is over. Unfortunately,these recommendations[28]are disproportionately for conspiracy theories promotingwhite supremacy[29], climate change denial, anddenial of the mass shootings[30]that plague the USA. What is going on? YouTube's algorithm is trying tomaximize how much time[31]people spend watching YouTube, andconspiracy theorists watch significantly more YouTube than people who trust a variety of media sources. Unfortunately, a recommendation system trying only to maximize time spent on its own platform will incentivize content that tells youthe rest of the media is lying. 'YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century,' ProfessorZeynep Tufekci wrote in the New York Times[32].Guillaume Chaslot[33]is a former YouTube engineer turned whistleblower. He has been outspoken about the harms caused by YouTube, and hepartnered with the Guardian[34]and the Wall Street Journal to study the extremism and bias in YouTube's recommendations.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Photo\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/12/30/researcher-here-are-5-things-that-scare-me-about-ai/#Photo</url> of Guillaume Chaslot from the Guardian articleYouTube is owned by Google, which is earning billions of dollars by aggressively introducing vulnerable people to conspiracy theories, while the rest of society bears theexternalized costs[35]of rising authoritarian governments, a resurgence in white supremacist movements, failure to act on climate change (even as extreme weather is creating increasing numbers of refugees), growing distrust of mainstream news sources, and a failure to pass sensible gun laws. This problem is an example ofthe tyranny of metrics[36]: metrics are just a proxy for what you really care about, and unthinkingly optimizing a metric can lead to unexpected, negative results. One analog example is that when the UK began publishing the success rates of surgeons,heart surgeons began turning down[37] risky (but necessary) surgeries to try to keep their scores as high as possible. Returning to the account of the popular5th grade teacher who was fired by an algorithm[38], she suspects that the underlying reason she was fired was that her incoming students had unusually high test scores the previous year (making it seem like their scores had dropped to a more average level after her teaching), and that their former teachers may have cheated. As USA education policy began over-emphasizing student test scores as the primary way to evaluate teachers, there have beenwidespread scandals[39]of teachers and principals cheating by altering students scores, in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Virginia, Texas, and elsewhere. When metrics are given undue importance, attempts to game those metrics become common.There is no accountability for big tech companiesMajor tech companies are the primary ones driving AI advances, and their algorithms impact billions of people. Unfortunately, these companies have zero accountability. YouTube (owned by Google) is helping toradicalize[40]people into white supremacy.Google allowed advertisers[41]to target people who search racist phrases like 'black people ruin neighborhoods' andFacebook allowed advertisers[42]to target groups like 'jew haters'. Amazon's facial recognition technologymisidentified 28 members of congress[43]as criminals, yet it isalready in use[44]by police departments.Palantir's predictive policing technology[45]was used for 6 years in New Orleans, with city council members not even knowing about the program, much less having any oversight. The newsfeed/timeline/recommendation algorithms of all the major platforms tend to reward incendiary content, prioritizing it for users. In early 2018,the UN ruled[46]that Facebook had played a 'determining role' in the ongoing genocide in Myanmar. 'I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast,' said the UN investigator. This result was not a surprise to anyone who had been following the situation in Myanmar.People warned Facebook executives[47]about how the platform was being used to spread dehumanizing hate speech and incite violence against an ethnic minority as early as 2013, and again in 2014 and 2015. As early as 2014, news outlets such asAl Jazeera[48]were covering Facebook's role in inciting ethnic violence in Myanmar. One personclose to the case[49]said, 'That's not 20/20 hindsight. The scale of this problem was significant and it was already apparent.'Facebook execs were warned in 2015 that Facebook could play the same role in Myanmar thatradio broadcasts had played during the 1994 Rwandan genocide[50]. As of 2015, Facebook onlyemployed 4 contractors[51]who spoke Burmese (the primary language in Myanmar). Contrast Facebook's inaction in Myanmar with their swift action in Germany after the passage of a new law, which could have resulted in penalties of up to 50 million euros.Facebook hired 1,200 German contractors[52]in under a year. In 2018, five years after Facebook was first warned about how they were being used to incite violence in Myanmar, they hired 'dozens' of Burmese contractors, a fraction of their response in Germany. Thecredible threat of a large financial penaltymay be the only thing Facebook responds to. While it can be easy to focus on regulations that are misguided or ineffective, we often take for grantedsafety standards and regulations[53]that have largely worked well. One major success story comes fromautomobile safety[54]. Early cars had sharp metal knobs on dashboard that lodged in people's skulls during crashes, plate glass windows that shattered dangerously, and non-collapsible steering columns that would frequently impale drivers. Beyond that, there was a widespread belief that the only issue with cars was the people driving them, and car manufactures did not want data on car safety to be collected. It took consumer safety advocates decades to push the conversation to how cars could be designed with greater safety, and to pass laws regarding seat belts, driver licenses, crash tests, and the collection of car crash data. For more on this topic,Datasheets for Datasets[55]covers cases studies of how standardization came to the electronics, pharmaceutical, and automobile industries, and 99% Invisible has adeep dive on the history of car safety[56](with parallels and contrasts to the gun industry).Here's how we can do betterThe good news: none of the problems listed here are inherent to algorithms! There are ways we can do better: Make sure there is a meaningful, human appeals process. Plan for how to catch and address mistakes in advance. Take responsibility, even when our work is just one part of the system. Be on the lookout for bias. Create data sheets for data sets. Choose not to just optimize metrics. Push for thoughtful regulations and standards for the tech industry. The problems we are facing can feel scary and complex. However, it is still very early on in this age of AI and increasing algorithmic automation. Now is a great time to take action: we can change our culture, cultivate a greater sense of responsibility for our work, seek out thoughtful accountability to counterbalance the inordinate power that major tech companies have, and choose to create more humane products and systems. Technology is just a tool, and it can be used for good or bad. Let's work to use it for good, to improve the lives of many, rather than just generate wealth for a small number of people. This article was originally published on Medium[57] by Rachel Thomas, a director of the USF Center for Applied Data Ethics and co-founder of Fast AI[58], a company making deep learning more accessible to people with little computational power and non-traditional backgrounds. Thomas was selected by Forbes as one of 20 Incredible Women in AI, earned her math PhD at Duke, and was an early engineer at Uber.

The solution, a significant sacrifice for Google, would be to open its entire search index to the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, which controls about 92 percent of the internet search market, has been fined more than $8 billion by the European Union since 2017, and now, U.S. authorities are considering the idea that the company has an antitrust issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Robert Epstein argues that by opening its index, Google can avoid more drastic regulatory measures, such as being carved up into many smaller companies, which may undermine its usefulness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The search index is a database of all web pages known to Google, including detailed data about each page that allows Google to determine what's on the page and how it should be categorized. Users currently can only peek into the index one search at a time. Epstein proposes for Google to allow unlimited access to the entire database.</p><p>\"If entities worldwide were given unlimited access to Google's index, ... within a year or two, thousands of new search platforms might emerge, each with different strengths and weaknesses,\" he wrote in a July 15 Bloomberg op-ed.</p><p>That, according to Epstein, would solve some of the most pressing problems of Google's monopoly.</p><p>'Manipulate the Thinking'</p><p>Epstein established a network of volunteers that share with him data about their Google searches. Based on the results, he determined that the company has an \"unprecedented ability to manipulate the thinking of 2.5 billion people, soon to be 4-plus billion.\"</p><p>\"The methods that they're using are invisible. They're subliminal. They're more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in behavioral sciences and I've been in behavioral sciences for almost 40 years,\" he testified to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on July 16. The core issue: \"People blindly trust high-ranking search results over lower ones.\"</p><p>Google's influence is so vast, it can shift undecided voters-four out of five ofthem in some demographics, he said.</p><p>\"In 2016, Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton, whom I supported,\" he testified. \"I know this, because I preserved more than 13,000 election-related searches prior to Election Day and Google's search results were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton.\"</p><p>For the 2018 election, Epstein further expanded his monitoring system, concluding that in the weeks leading up to Election Day, \"bias in Google search results may have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes, spread across many races, to the candidates of one political party.\"</p><p>Moreover, the \"Go Vote\" reminder that Google displayed on its home page in 2018 \"gave one political party at least 800,000 more votes than it gave the other party,\" he said.</p><p>\"That reminder was not a public service; it was a vote manipulation.\"</p><p>He warned that tech companies such as Google and Facebook were \"overconfident\" in 2016, but \"in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out.\"</p><p>\"If these companies all support the same candidate, they will have the power to shift 15 million votes to that candidate,\" he said.</p><p>Epstein is now fundraising to set up an even more extensive monitoring system for 2020, but suggests that making Google open up its index could preempt many of the problems.</p><p>\"At the moment, it's entirely up to Google to determine which bubble you're in, which search suggestions you receive, and which search results appear at the top of the list; that's the stuff of worldwide mind control,\" he wrote in the op-ed. \"But with thousands ofsearch platforms vying for your attention, the power is back in your hands.\"</p><p>He drew a parallel to the 1956 consent decree that made AT&amp;T share its patents.</p><p>\"There's precedent both in law and Google's business practices to justify taking this step,\" he said.</p><p>He concluded the testimony warning that \"democracy, as originally conceived, cannot survive big tech as currently empowered.\"</p><p>Google representatives have previously dismissed Epstein's research methodology as \"flawed,\" but didn't say how.</p><p>Google didn't respond to a request for comment regarding Epstein's proposal as put forward in the oped.</p><p>Political Preferences</p><p>Google has repeatedly claimed political neutrality.</p><p>\"We operate a number of platforms and they are constructed and operated to be politically neutral or apolitical,\" said Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president for Government Affairs and Public Policy, during the July 16 hearing.</p><p>That position, however, has been undermined by a growing pile of evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Project Veritas, a right-leaning investigative journalism nonprofit, published on June 24 a video showing Google employees and internal documents backing the allegation that Google infuses its political worldview into its products without disclosing that to its users.</p><p>The expos\u00e9 corroborated from multiple sources that Google uses a doctrine of \"fairness\" to tweak its products in order to surreptitiously push its users toward its preferred political worldview.</p><p>On June 25, Project Veritas published an internal email that shows a Google employee calling conservative voices such as Ben Shapiro and PragerU, led by Dennis Prager, as \"Nazis using dog whistles.\" It also labeled Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson as such. All three are outspoken critics of Nazism.</p><p>\"Two of three of these people are Jewish, very religious Jews, and yet, you think they're Nazis,\" said Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) while questioning Derek Slater, Google's global director of information policy, during a June 26 hearing. \"It begs the question: What kind of education do people at Google have so they think that religious Jews are Nazis?\"</p><p>More overtly, Google and other major tech platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, have publicly endorsed a model of content policing that reflects certain political leanings.</p><p>All of them, for instance, prohibit \"hate speech,\" a concept much more broadly adopted by the political left, a 2017 Cato survey showed.</p><p>Moreover, the concept is so subjective it's impossible to enforce fairly and impartially, said Nadine Strossen, a law professor and former president of the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>\"Even if we have content moderation that is enforced with the noblest principles and people are striving to be fair and impartial, it is impossible,\" she said, testifying at the June 26 House hearing. \"These so-called standards are irreducibly subjective. What is one person's hate speech ... is somebody else's cherished loving speech.\"</p><p>At the moment, it's entirely up to Google to determine which bubble you're in, which search suggestions you receive, and which search results appear at the top of the list; that's the stuff of worldwide mind control.</p><p>Robert Epstein, psychologist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2263228078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP2-DRV1-JC85-J36C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1150\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 493</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump highlighted the research that showed Google shifted millions of voters for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and the company is now working to create a much bigger impact on the 2020 election. And Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, responded with a tweet linking to the research that Trump was referring to in his tweet.Here is analysis/testimony on @Google[5]'s impact on our elections to which President @RealDonaldTrump[6] is referencing, and which Hillary Clinton and this era's totalitarian left are now trying to suppress.

Epstein described himself as a 'very strong public supporter of Hillary Clinton,' but he said the influence of Google, Facebook, Twitter and other sites threatens American Democracy. 'So you're not dismayed that people voted for (Clinton), your testimony is that Google is through bias in search results manipulating voters in a way that they're not aware of?' Sen. Ted Cruz questioned at the senate hearing. [embedded content] 'On a massive scale,' Epstein said, 'and what I'm saying is that I believe in Democracy, I believe in the free and fair election, more than I have any kind of allegiance to a candidate or a party.'Declare Your Independence!

Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomEpstein detailed some of the many ways - from total control over search results and quick-answer results, to voting reminders and other tactics - that Big Tech swayed 'a rock bottom minimum' of 2.6 million to as many as 10.4 million votes to Clinton in 2016. In his promised 'twitter storm' Dr. Epstein first called out President Trump on three points: point #1: I've never said that #Google deliberately 'manipulated' the 2016 election, but I measured substantial pro-#Hillary bias in #Google's search results by preserving ...alyzing 13,207 election-related searches ...e 98,044 web pages linked to those searches. point #2: The level of pro-#Hillary bias I found in #Google's search results - absent on #Bing ...ahoo - was enough to convince between 2.6 ....4 million undecided voters to vote for Hillary. @realDonaldTrump said 16 million; that's wrong. point #3: It doesn't matter whether the bias in #Google search results was deliberate or not.

I have a framed, signed letter from #Bill on the wall near my desk. But #Hillary should be ashamed of herself.'#Hillary[16] has long depended on #Google[17] for both money ...tes. Her largest donor in 2016 was Alphabet/Google. Her Chief Technology Officer during the campaign was Stephanie Hannon, a former Google exec. And then there's #EricSchmidt[18], longtime head of Google - the guy in the pic: pic.twitter.com/dSV8wOPwAH[19]; \u2014 Dr. Robert Epstein (@DrREpstein) August 20, 2019[20][In the interest of readability, the rest of his tweets are presented here in the order they were posted complete with the links as he posted them.] About 96% of 2016 campaign donations from #Google employees went to #Hillary. And #ElanKriegel, Hillary's Chief Analytics Officer, credits his 2012 tech team, informally supervised by #EricSchmidt, for half of Obama's win margin: nearly 2.5 million votes.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/obamas-big-data-inconclusive-results-political-campaigns-72687\">https://psmag.com/social-justice/obamas-big-data-inconclusive-results-political-campaigns-72687</url>[21] If my work has been 'debunked,' why was it included in a volume just published by #Oxford U.?

It's the year when a firework of electric-vehicle (EV) launches began and charging infrastructure became solid in key regions; when cars enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) began to replace \"dumb\" ones; when we moved from advanced driver-assistance systems to autonomous vehicles (AVs) in real life; when the automotive and mobility industries shifted from a driver- or owner-focused value proposition to a customer-centered one; and when micromobility started to scale up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You can make the case that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-automotive-revolution-is-speeding-up\">all four ACES trends</url>-autonomous driving, connected cars, electrification, and smart mobility-made appreciable advances in 2018, despite some setbacks. It was the year when theoretical discussions about the future of mobility turned into concrete actions across businesses, cities, and key world regions. Please join us in reviewing some of the highlights from this singular year and exploring what the future could bring.</p><h>Autonomous vehicles</h><p>Possibly the furthest into the future measured by large-scale commercialization, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/autonomous-driving-disruption-technology-use-cases-and-opportunities\">AVs still appear on track</url> in terms of technology. While manufacturers are still working to ensure safety requirements are met, they seem to have overcome major technology hurdles, and most of them made exciting moves in 2018. OEMs are seriously considering AVs as a business. They reallocate capacity and their vehicle portfolio to free up cash for AV investments, restructure their organizations by moving key executives to AV business units, and are most aggressive in forming partnerships with cities and local municipalities.</p><p>High cost is an ongoing concern, however, which is one reason major automotive, high-tech, and mobility players are teaming up (Exhibit 1). The field is becoming more crowded as well-for example, with all three of China's big tech players now pursuing AVs.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex1.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The pace of overall investment in future mobility technology is accelerating greatly: between the periods of 2010 to 2013 and 2014 to 2017, the average annual investment across all technologies jumped nearly sixfold, to $25.3 billion per year, from $4.3 billion per year. While investments in sharing and autonomous solutions account for much of this acceleration, investments in hardware like sensors and semiconductors are rather stable, showing a steady trend of consolidation. (For a deeper dive on the topic, see \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/analyzing-start-up-and-investment-trends-in-the-mobility-ecosystem\">Analyzing start-up and investment trends in the mobility ecosystem</url>.\")</emphasis></p><p>Overall, regulation remains supportive of AVs. In 2018, many regions adopted new definitions that pave the way for vehicles without steering wheels. We have also noted that industry players are engaging in self-regulation when AV crashes occur by voluntarily suspending testing activities. Such responsibility apparently does not go unnoticed by consumers: in McKinsey's recent ACES survey, 42 percent of respondents had a positive view of the technology.</p><p>Mobility and automotive players increasingly focus on use cases to understand the imminent AV market, as growing numbers of them concentrate on bringing viable products to market as soon as possible. Early target cities include Phoenix and San Francisco, and we are hearing much more about so-called \"geofenced\" applications for use in airports and other similarly enclosed venues. Companies are also working out the bugs on specific AV applications, such as those enabling AV fleets to relocate autonomous carsharing vehicles at night in places like Eindhoven in the Netherlands. It has become clear that different players explore different use cases-from robo-taxis, autonomous shuttles, to private-campus autonomous shuttles-which indicates that this market offers room for multiple players to exist.</p><p>It becomes clearer that most AV companies plan to operate the fleet without major infrastructure measures.</p><p>As the automotive industry transitions from hardware- to software-defined vehicles, the average software and electronics content per vehicle is rapidly increasing (Exhibit 2). And AI will continue to play an important role (Exhibit 3).</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex2.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Software represents 10 percent of overall vehicle content today for a D-segment, or large, car (approximately $1,220), and the average share of software is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 11 percent, to reach 30 percent of overall vehicle content (around $5,200) in 2030. Not surprisingly, players across the digital automotive value chain are attempting to capitalize on innovations enabled through software and electronics. (For more, see \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/rethinking-car-software-and-electronics-architecture\">Rethinking car software and electronics architecture</url>.\")</emphasis></p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex3.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AI is creating value not only in the vehicle itself but also in the company: in the short to medium term, there is a substantial, AI-enabled opportunity that by 2025 could reach an annual value of about $215 billion for automotive OEMs worldwide (Exhibit 3). This corresponds to nine percentage points of earnings before interest and taxes for the whole automotive industry, or a theoretical average-annual-productivity increase of approximately 1.3 percent over seven years-a significant value to boost the industry's regular productivity aspiration of about 2 percent annually. (For more, see \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-as-auto-companies-new-engine-of-value\">Artificial intelligence as auto companies' new engine of value</url>.\")</emphasis></p><h>Connected cars</h><p>This is another trend in which the industry focus is shifting from discussing to doing. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/accelerating-the-car-data-monetization-journey\">Monetizing all that car data</url> is a hot topic in this area, with more companies exploring the prospects for in-car payments. McKinsey's ACES survey suggests that consumers expect to spend nearly 30 percent of their time in an AV focused on entertainment offers and online shopping.</p><p>Industry stakeholders (and governments) increasingly seek to \"stack hands\" on standards while also finding new ways of cooperating and sharing data streams and cybersecurity (Exhibit 4). In one case, two ridesharing companies have joined forces to share data with cities.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex4-expanded.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Although most recognize that today's and tomorrow's car will increasingly be connected, there is no clear-cut standard yet to define what \"connectivity\" means. This lack of clarity is hindering the development of connectivity use cases, as there is no standard language for industry, and it is difficult for customers to compare features and understand how the capability of the cars matches their needs. To address the issue, McKinsey developed a Connected Car Customer Experience (C3X) framework (Exhibit 4). The C3X framework describes five levels of user experience in connected cars-ranging from the most basic to the highly complex. (For more, see \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/setting-the-framework-for-car-connectivity-and-user-experience\">Setting the framework for car connectivity and user experience</url>.\")</emphasis></p><p>Connected-car advances are forcing traditional automotive companies to rethink car software and electronics architecture, and several have launched AI-supported human-machine interfaces with a totally different level of user experience and truly modular infotainment platforms, enabling also over-the-air updates at scale. Some players keep pushing the boundaries of software and computing power, with one EV company installing the most advanced centralization of computing power in a water-cooled supercomputer. Another key challenge involves efforts to integrate future fifth-generation telecom technologies into connected-car platforms.</p><h>Electric vehicles</h><p>Regulation remains the primary market maker for EVs, offering substantial incentives as well as noncash benefits, such as special-highway-lane access and favorable licensing arrangements. This strong regulatory \"push\" helps to make the EV tipping point the most visible among the four ACES trends (Exhibit 5). More countries and cities are announcing plans to ban the internal combustion engine, and while the European Union has proposed ambitious passenger-car and truck carbon-dioxide (CO2) reductions through 2030 this year, the United States is the only major government focused on unwinding its aspirational CO2 targets.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex5.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Electric mobility follows the same four-step evolution as other disruptive trends do. Having reached a critical mass of EVs, Norway is clearly ahead of other countries-the EV disruption is inevitable. Most other countries are still in the first stage, except for China and Sweden, which have already advanced to the second: disruption is somewhat more clear, with the EV emerging as a validated model.

Batteries and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/lithium-and-cobalt-a-tale-of-two-commodities\">the raw materials to produce them</url> remain a key EV challenge (Exhibit 6), and a wide variety of companies around the world are establishing production capacity. They are also hammering out details regarding greater technological cooperation via joint ventures and other types of alliances with governments (as seen with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/charging-ahead-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-demand\">charging infrastructure</url>) and new mobility-industry players, such as tech giants, chip makers, and battery producers (Exhibit 7).</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex6.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Despite higher up-front investments-in the form of engineering hours, new tooling, and so on-native EV platforms have proved advantageous over nonnative models in multiple ways. Designing the vehicle architecture entirely around an EV concept, without combustion-engine-legacy elements, means fewer compromises and more flexibility, on average.

Focused primarily on passenger vehicles, a variety of players will also concentrate on commercial vehicles. Traditional OEMs are introducing an increasingly rich and attractive array of EV models, including cars, SUVs, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/fast-transit-why-urban-e-buses-lead-electric-vehicle-growth\">buses</url>, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks. From a regional perspective, China remains the EV-market leader, with companies there gaining a 46 percent production-market share.</p><p>While EVs remain one of the most visible ACES trends, it became more and more clear this year that we need a broad power-train portfolio that will last for a long time. For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/hydrogen-the-next-wave-for-electric-vehicles\">hydrogen has gained increasing currency</url> as one of the key ways to make the transition to clean energy happen. Look for more on hydrogen over the next 12 months.</p><h>Smart or shared mobility</h><p>The \"next big thing\" in shared mobility could be rather small: micromobility. It involves the use of shared electric scooters, bicycles, and other simple conveyances, facilitated via special apps. The industry has already attracted more than $1 billion in investments. However, as bikesharing services in China show, successful micromobility plays require robust organization and strong community and local government support.</p><p>In general, shared mobility offers cities an outsize opportunity to solve some critical problems, but left unmanaged, it could create some equally large challenges. Meanwhile, several major automakers are pushing to take active shared-mobility roles and restructuring their current mobility organizations to create entirely new business models, sometimes in league with major competitors. Other OEMs are pushing new mobility-subscription models as well.</p><p>The ride-hailing market continued to evolve in 2018, with major players focusing on fewer markets with greater market shares. The overall lack of profitability of carsharing and ride-hailing businesses remains a central industry challenge-one that will become a more visible issue as major players prepare to launch initial public offerings.</p><p>A parallel industry development involves freightsharing or trucksharing, especially when dealing with \"last mile\" deliveries (Exhibit 8).</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Automotive and Assembly/Our Insights/Reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/SVGZ-Reserve-a-seat-ex8.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Customers are demanding more from their delivery providers, and a highly competitive environment combined with customer sensitivity to high cost has pushed forward the development of technology that will help the industry deliver on these demands. Combined, these trends mandate immediate adoption of these new technologies by last-mile players. The growing importance of technology in the last-mile industry will affect the overall ecosystem, including its competitive dynamics and the distribution of value across industry players. (For more, see \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-transport-and-logistics/our-insights/technology-delivered-implications-for-cost-customers-and-competition-in-the-last-mile-ecosystem\">Technology delivered: Implications for cost, customers, and competition in the last-mile ecosystem</url>.\")</emphasis></p><p>It has also been an exciting year for urban aerial mobility, personal air vehicles, electric vertical takeoff and landing, or, more informally, \"flying cars\"-whichever term you prefer to describe new vehicles transporting people through the air in cities and their surroundings. On the investment side, we have seen the first triple-digit investment round. Fueled by the increased funding and awareness, there are now more than 100 companies exploring different designs and operational models. At the same time, we are seeing pioneers in this field move toward operational testing, with one player announcing flight tests in the center of Singapore in the second half of 2019. All these advances are pushing regulators to move at speeds unheard of before. Creating a safe and reliable new mode of transportation in the urban environment will continue to push all players to their limits.</p><h>All eyes on 2019</h><p>As the next 12 months unfold, and the pace of change in the mobility sector likely quickens, we would like to raise several key questions regarding the future of mobility as a whole and of the four ACES trends in particular. First, the general question: Will cities build integrated seamless mobility plans and, in the process, orchestrate ecosystems and drive the four ACES trends to completion as elements of their own visions of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future\">smart cities</url></p><p>For AVs, how will the experiences of the first real-life applications influence the subsequent industry, and should mobility players focus on managing the public debate on the levels of technology failure users will accept? Likewise, will we see a convergence of driving systems, and will clear \"winners\" emerge in the tech stack?</p><p>As for connected cars, will increasing connectivity enable breakthroughs in certain use cases, such as predictive maintenance? Will players create business models around connectivity that create new levels of value for consumers?</p><p>Regarding electrification, how will the availability of many more EVs play out? Will it seem like a general market ramp-up, or will market shares of established OEMs versus new players change the retail market in fundamental ways? What will happen to industry profitability?</p><p>Regarding smart and shared mobility, will use cases emerge that can scale up shared mobility in areas like commuting? Will established platform providers become the winners behind mobility as a service and new mobility platforms? And finally, what will it take to establish a successful micromobility business? As the future of mobility begins to unfold, companies, regulators, and society alike will need to keep both eyes on the street in 2019 to manage the technological disruptions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Download \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/reserve a seat the future of mobility is arriving early/reserve-a-seat-the-future-of-mobility-is-arriving-early.ashx\">Reserve a seat-the future of mobility is arriving early</url>,\" to read the full collection of articles discussed (PDF-6MB).</emphasis></p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=A3622AEA29D84101BEBA1E2D031CD6AE&amp;_z=z\">Timo M\u00f6ller</url></emphasis> is a senior expert in McKinsey's Cologne office, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=25C04011150D4DBD8D5B3D1A82C6659B&amp;_z=z\">Asutosh Padhi</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the Chicago office, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=581F73A30A7842D9B7E7B6B071C2B28D&amp;_z=z\">Dickon Pinner</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the San Francisco office, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=C361A19D0834406287BF5FF1E74D18D4&amp;_z=z\">Andreas Tschiesner</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the Munich office.

The bank put together three scenarios for the economy in Friday's August <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/aug/\">Statement of Monetary Policy</url>, which is now our most up-to-date official view of the economy -- the government's July economic update having been, through no fault of Josh Frydenberg, comprehensively trashed by events in Victoria.  Even the RBA's \"baseline\" scenario, seen as most likely, paints a miserable few years for Australians. The Great Morrison Stagnation that was the world pre-COVID will seem like nirvana in 2021 and 2022. And we still don't really know how the recovery will play out -- the RBA admits (as it has done for a while now) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be confident about key economic estimates more than three months into the immediate future. Nevertheless.  \"It is expected that there will be ample spare capacity in the labour market over the next few years, with broader measures of labour market underutilisation remaining elevated,\"\u00a0the RBA says. \"Consumption is not expected to reach its pre-COVID-19 level until early 2022 ... household income is expected to decline over coming quarters as government support is tapered.\"  The RBA is also pessimistic about business investment other than mining. It expects it won't start recovering until\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">after</emphasis> household consumption has picked up again.  \"The timing and pace of the recovery in non-mining investment remains highly uncertain, but is expected to lag the recovery in consumption. This reflects the assumption that firms will first use up spare capacity as demand picks up, as well as the typical long lags in the planning and approval of construction projects. By the end of the forecast horizon, non-mining business investment is forecast to still be below its pre-pandemic level.\"  That will be a key impediment to jobs growth, and will create a vicious circle in which households aren't spending because of a lack of jobs growth, and businesses aren't investing, and putting on more staff, because households aren't spending.   That was the kind of rut we were stuck in before the pandemic: the 2018-19 budget forecast of non-mining investment growth of over 5% ended up at just 1.6%; a similar forecast in last year's pre-election budget was drastically revised down to 2% in last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, long before anyone had heard of COVID-19.  Getting businesses investing is thus a key challenge of the October budget. Business, of course, is insisting that reducing company tax, making it easier to cut wages, increasing the GST and deregulation will get them investing, and the government is sympathetic to that view.  Even if we accept those arguments from business (in the face of evidence), there are other impediments to investment and innovation that the government can control.   It's now well-established that growing market concentration in the US over the last two decades has led to overly high profits (at least according to the organ of socialism,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Economist</emphasis>) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy\">declines</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/reporter/2019number4/philippon.html\">business investment</url>. Labor's Andrew Leigh has long studied and written about the problem <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.andrewleigh.com/markets_monopolies_moguls_speech\">from an Australian perspective</url>, where if anything we have a significantly more concentrated economy.  The current recession will exacerbate this problem. As smaller, more marginal businesses succumb to the recession, larger businesses survive and enjoy greater market share. Competition regulators and governments are more likely to approve mergers of failing businesses with successful competitors. That happens in every recession.   But the pandemic has also entrenched the power of big yech. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/07/31/tech-giants-profits-2020/\">have all unveiled results</url> recently that show them essentially impervious to the historic contraction underway -- or, in the case of Amazon, actually benefiting from it. These companies are now significantly larger than all but the biggest economies around the world.  That was before the Trump administration decided it wanted one of the big tech firms to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/10/hypocrisy-around-tiktok-is-nothing-short-of-astonishing/\">compulsorily acquire TikTok</url>, one of the few successful competitors to big tech's dominance outside China.  The only way to address the problem of concentration undermining investment is an aggressive application of competition law that reduces concentration.

The bank put together three scenarios for the economy in Friday's August <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/aug/\">Statement of Monetary Policy</url>, which is now our most up-to-date official view of the economy -- the government's July economic update having been, through no fault of Josh Frydenberg, comprehensively trashed by events in Victoria.  Even the RBA's \"baseline\" scenario, seen as most likely, paints a miserable few years for Australians. The Great Morrison Stagnation that was the world pre-COVID will seem like nirvana in 2021 and 2022. And we still don't really know how the recovery will play out -- the RBA admits (as it has done for a while now) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be confident about key economic estimates more than three months into the immediate future. Nevertheless.  \"It is expected that there will be ample spare capacity in the labour market over the next few years, with broader measures of labour market underutilisation remaining elevated,\"\u00a0the RBA says. \"Consumption is not expected to reach its pre-COVID-19 level until early 2022 ... household income is expected to decline over coming quarters as government support is tapered.\"  The RBA is also pessimistic about business investment other than mining. It expects it won't start recovering until\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">after</emphasis> household consumption has picked up again.  \"The timing and pace of the recovery in non-mining investment remains highly uncertain, but is expected to lag the recovery in consumption. This reflects the assumption that firms will first use up spare capacity as demand picks up, as well as the typical long lags in the planning and approval of construction projects. By the end of the forecast horizon, non-mining business investment is forecast to still be below its pre-pandemic level.\"  That will be a key impediment to jobs growth, and will create a vicious circle in which households aren't spending because of a lack of jobs growth, and businesses aren't investing, and putting on more staff, because households aren't spending.   That was the kind of rut we were stuck in before the pandemic: the 2018-19 budget forecast of non-mining investment growth of over 5% ended up at just 1.6%; a similar forecast in last year's pre-election budget was drastically revised down to 2% in last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, long before anyone had heard of COVID-19.  Getting businesses investing is thus a key challenge of the October budget. Business, of course, is insisting that reducing company tax, making it easier to cut wages, increasing the GST and deregulation will get them investing, and the government is sympathetic to that view.  Even if we accept those arguments from business (in the face of evidence), there are other impediments to investment and innovation that the government can control.   It's now well-established that growing market concentration in the US over the last two decades has led to overly high profits (at least according to the organ of socialism,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Economist</emphasis>) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy\">declines</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/reporter/2019number4/philippon.html\">business investment</url>. Labor's Andrew Leigh has long studied and written about the problem <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.andrewleigh.com/markets_monopolies_moguls_speech\">from an Australian perspective</url>, where if anything we have a significantly more concentrated economy.  The current recession will exacerbate this problem. As smaller, more marginal businesses succumb to the recession, larger businesses survive and enjoy greater market share. Competition regulators and governments are more likely to approve mergers of failing businesses with successful competitors. That happens in every recession.   But the pandemic has also entrenched the power of big yech. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/07/31/tech-giants-profits-2020/\">have all unveiled results</url> recently that show them essentially impervious to the historic contraction underway -- or, in the case of Amazon, actually benefiting from it. These companies are now significantly larger than all but the biggest economies around the world.  That was before the Trump administration decided it wanted one of the big tech firms to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/10/hypocrisy-around-tiktok-is-nothing-short-of-astonishing/\">compulsorily acquire TikTok</url>, one of the few successful competitors to big tech's dominance outside China.  The only way to address the problem of concentration undermining investment is an aggressive application of competition law that reduces concentration. Business hates that idea with a passion -- witness the hostile reaction to the Turnbull government's idea for divestment powers in energy regulation, something even Labor thought was outrageous.  But failing that, a low-competition, low-investment future beckons, with permanent implications for economic growth. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-2B31-JD6R-T016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><timeReceived>11:10:08 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN4D</classCode><className>LABOR MARKET</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX002023</classCode><className>LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000383</classCode><className>CONSUMPTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The bank put together three scenarios for the economy in Friday's August <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/aug/\">Statement of Monetary Policy</url>, which is now our most up-to-date official view of the economy -- the government's July economic update having been, through no fault of Josh Frydenberg, comprehensively trashed by events in Victoria.  Even the RBA's \"baseline\" scenario, seen as most likely, paints a miserable few years for Australians. The Great Morrison Stagnation that was the world pre-COVID will seem like nirvana in 2021 and 2022. And we still don't really know how the recovery will play out -- the RBA admits (as it has done for a while now) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be confident about key economic estimates more than three months into the immediate future. Nevertheless.  \"It is expected that there will be ample spare capacity in the labour market over the next few years, with broader measures of labour market underutilisation remaining elevated,\"\u00a0the RBA says. \"Consumption is not expected to reach its pre-COVID-19 level until early 2022 ... household income is expected to decline over coming quarters as government support is tapered.\"  The RBA is also pessimistic about business investment other than mining. It expects it won't start recovering until\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">after</emphasis> household consumption has picked up again.  \"The timing and pace of the recovery in non-mining investment remains highly uncertain, but is expected to lag the recovery in consumption. This reflects the assumption that firms will first use up spare capacity as demand picks up, as well as the typical long lags in the planning and approval of construction projects. By the end of the forecast horizon, non-mining business investment is forecast to still be below its pre-pandemic level.\"  That will be a key impediment to jobs growth, and will create a vicious circle in which households aren't spending because of a lack of jobs growth, and businesses aren't investing, and putting on more staff, because households aren't spending.   That was the kind of rut we were stuck in before the pandemic: the 2018-19 budget forecast of non-mining investment growth of over 5% ended up at just 1.6%; a similar forecast in last year's pre-election budget was drastically revised down to 2% in last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, long before anyone had heard of COVID-19.  Getting businesses investing is thus a key challenge of the October budget. Business, of course, is insisting that reducing company tax, making it easier to cut wages, increasing the GST and deregulation will get them investing, and the government is sympathetic to that view.  Even if we accept those arguments from business (in the face of evidence), there are other impediments to investment and innovation that the government can control.

The bank put together three scenarios for the economy in Friday's August <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/aug/\">Statement of Monetary Policy</url>, which is now our most up-to-date official view of the economy -- the government's July economic update having been, through no fault of Josh Frydenberg, comprehensively trashed by events in Victoria.  Even the RBA's \"baseline\" scenario, seen as most likely, paints a miserable few years for Australians. The Great Morrison Stagnation that was the world pre-COVID will seem like nirvana in 2021 and 2022. And we still don't really know how the recovery will play out -- the RBA admits (as it has done for a while now) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be confident about key economic estimates more than three months into the immediate future. Nevertheless.  \"It is expected that there will be ample spare capacity in the labour market over the next few years, with broader measures of labour market underutilisation remaining elevated,\"\u00a0the RBA says. \"Consumption is not expected to reach its pre-COVID-19 level until early 2022 ... household income is expected to decline over coming quarters as government support is tapered.\"  The RBA is also pessimistic about business investment other than mining. It expects it won't start recovering until\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">after</emphasis> household consumption has picked up again.  \"The timing and pace of the recovery in non-mining investment remains highly uncertain, but is expected to lag the recovery in consumption. This reflects the assumption that firms will first use up spare capacity as demand picks up, as well as the typical long lags in the planning and approval of construction projects. By the end of the forecast horizon, non-mining business investment is forecast to still be below its pre-pandemic level.\"  That will be a key impediment to jobs growth, and will create a vicious circle in which households aren't spending because of a lack of jobs growth, and businesses aren't investing, and putting on more staff, because households aren't spending.   That was the kind of rut we were stuck in before the pandemic: the 2018-19 budget forecast of non-mining investment growth of over 5% ended up at just 1.6%; a similar forecast in last year's pre-election budget was drastically revised down to 2% in last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, long before anyone had heard of COVID-19.  Getting businesses investing is thus a key challenge of the October budget. Business, of course, is insisting that reducing company tax, making it easier to cut wages, increasing the GST and deregulation will get them investing, and the government is sympathetic to that view.  Even if we accept those arguments from business (in the face of evidence), there are other impediments to investment and innovation that the government can control.   It's now well-established that growing market concentration in the US over the last two decades has led to overly high profits (at least according to the organ of socialism,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Economist</emphasis>) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy\">declines</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/reporter/2019number4/philippon.html\">business investment</url>. Labor's Andrew Leigh has long studied and written about the problem <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.andrewleigh.com/markets_monopolies_moguls_speech\">from an Australian perspective</url>, where if anything we have a significantly more concentrated economy.  The current recession will exacerbate this problem. As smaller, more marginal businesses succumb to the recession, larger businesses survive and enjoy greater market share. Competition regulators and governments are more likely to approve mergers of failing businesses with successful competitors. That happens in every recession.   But the pandemic has also entrenched the power of big yech.

The only way to address the problem of concentration undermining investment is an aggressive application of competition law that reduces concentration.

The bank put together three scenarios for the economy in Friday's August <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/aug/\">Statement of Monetary Policy</url>, which is now our most up-to-date official view of the economy -- the government's July economic update having been, through no fault of Josh Frydenberg, comprehensively trashed by events in Victoria.  Even the RBA's \"baseline\" scenario, seen as most likely, paints a miserable few years for Australians. The Great Morrison Stagnation that was the world pre-COVID will seem like nirvana in 2021 and 2022. And we still don't really know how the recovery will play out -- the RBA admits (as it has done for a while now) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be confident about key economic estimates more than three months into the immediate future. Nevertheless.  \"It is expected that there will be ample spare capacity in the labour market over the next few years, with broader measures of labour market underutilisation remaining elevated,\"\u00a0the RBA says. \"Consumption is not expected to reach its pre-COVID-19 level until early 2022 ... household income is expected to decline over coming quarters as government support is tapered.\"  The RBA is also pessimistic about business investment other than mining. It expects it won't start recovering until\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">after</emphasis> household consumption has picked up again.  \"The timing and pace of the recovery in non-mining investment remains highly uncertain, but is expected to lag the recovery in consumption. This reflects the assumption that firms will first use up spare capacity as demand picks up, as well as the typical long lags in the planning and approval of construction projects. By the end of the forecast horizon, non-mining business investment is forecast to still be below its pre-pandemic level.\"  That will be a key impediment to jobs growth, and will create a vicious circle in which households aren't spending because of a lack of jobs growth, and businesses aren't investing, and putting on more staff, because households aren't spending.   That was the kind of rut we were stuck in before the pandemic: the 2018-19 budget forecast of non-mining investment growth of over 5% ended up at just 1.6%; a similar forecast in last year's pre-election budget was drastically revised down to 2% in last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, long before anyone had heard of COVID-19.  Getting businesses investing is thus a key challenge of the October budget. Business, of course, is insisting that reducing company tax, making it easier to cut wages, increasing the GST and deregulation will get them investing, and the government is sympathetic to that view.  Even if we accept those arguments from business (in the face of evidence), there are other impediments to investment and innovation that the government can control.   It's now well-established that growing market concentration in the US over the last two decades has led to overly high profits (at least according to the organ of socialism,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Economist</emphasis>) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy\">declines</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/reporter/2019number4/philippon.html\">business investment</url>. Labor's Andrew Leigh has long studied and written about the problem <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.andrewleigh.com/markets_monopolies_moguls_speech\">from an Australian perspective</url>, where if anything we have a significantly more concentrated economy.  The current recession will exacerbate this problem. As smaller, more marginal businesses succumb to the recession, larger businesses survive and enjoy greater market share. Competition regulators and governments are more likely to approve mergers of failing businesses with successful competitors. That happens in every recession.   But the pandemic has also entrenched the power of big yech. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/07/31/tech-giants-profits-2020/\">have all unveiled results</url> recently that show them essentially impervious to the historic contraction underway -- or, in the case of Amazon, actually benefiting from it. These companies are now significantly larger than all but the biggest economies around the world.  That was before the Trump administration decided it wanted one of the big tech firms to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/10/hypocrisy-around-tiktok-is-nothing-short-of-astonishing/\">compulsorily acquire TikTok</url>, one of the few successful competitors to big tech's dominance outside China.  The only way to address the problem of concentration undermining investment is an aggressive application of competition law that reduces concentration. Business hates that idea with a passion -- witness the hostile reaction to the Turnbull government's idea for divestment powers in energy regulation, something even Labor thought was outrageous.  But failing that, a low-competition, low-investment future beckons, with permanent implications for economic growth. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MD-6JM1-JD6R-T031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><timeReceived>11:10:08 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN4D</classCode><className>LABOR MARKET</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX002023</classCode><className>LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000383</classCode><className>CONSUMPTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The bank put together three scenarios for the economy in Friday's August <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/aug/\">Statement of Monetary Policy</url>, which is now our most up-to-date official view of the economy -- the government's July economic update having been, through no fault of Josh Frydenberg, comprehensively trashed by events in Victoria.  Even the RBA's \"baseline\" scenario, seen as most likely, paints a miserable few years for Australians. The Great Morrison Stagnation that was the world pre-COVID will seem like nirvana in 2021 and 2022. And we still don't really know how the recovery will play out -- the RBA admits (as it has done for a while now) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be confident about key economic estimates more than three months into the immediate future. Nevertheless.  \"It is expected that there will be ample spare capacity in the labour market over the next few years, with broader measures of labour market underutilisation remaining elevated,\"\u00a0the RBA says. \"Consumption is not expected to reach its pre-COVID-19 level until early 2022 ... household income is expected to decline over coming quarters as government support is tapered.\"  The RBA is also pessimistic about business investment other than mining. It expects it won't start recovering until\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">after</emphasis> household consumption has picked up again.  \"The timing and pace of the recovery in non-mining investment remains highly uncertain, but is expected to lag the recovery in consumption. This reflects the assumption that firms will first use up spare capacity as demand picks up, as well as the typical long lags in the planning and approval of construction projects. By the end of the forecast horizon, non-mining business investment is forecast to still be below its pre-pandemic level.\"  That will be a key impediment to jobs growth, and will create a vicious circle in which households aren't spending because of a lack of jobs growth, and businesses aren't investing, and putting on more staff, because households aren't spending.   That was the kind of rut we were stuck in before the pandemic: the 2018-19 budget forecast of non-mining investment growth of over 5% ended up at just 1.6%; a similar forecast in last year's pre-election budget was drastically revised down to 2% in last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, long before anyone had heard of COVID-19.  Getting businesses investing is thus a key challenge of the October budget. Business, of course, is insisting that reducing company tax, making it easier to cut wages, increasing the GST and deregulation will get them investing, and the government is sympathetic to that view.  Even if we accept those arguments from business (in the face of evidence), there are other impediments to investment and innovation that the government can control.   It's now well-established that growing market concentration in the US over the last two decades has led to overly high profits (at least according to the organ of socialism,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Economist</emphasis>) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy\">declines</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/reporter/2019number4/philippon.html\">business investment</url>.

The current recession will exacerbate this problem. As smaller, more marginal businesses succumb to the recession, larger businesses survive and enjoy greater market share.

However, supervising Google or Amazon as a bank is not the way to do that, according to Felix Hufeld, president of German financial regulator BaFin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators must spot trends that could threaten the integrity of financial markets, instead of designing a new definition of banking services, Hufeld said at the European Banking Regulation conference in Frankfurt. New rules should be imposed only when technology-driven ventures need to bear certain responsibilities to safeguard that integrity, he said.</p><p>\"We want to supervise technology in a neutral fashion. We don't want to supervise companies just for the sake of technology,\" he said during a Nov. 20 panel discussion.</p><p>Although the likes of Amazon and Google already offer banking-related services, they have no incentive to become a bank as it would be \"highly dilutive\" to their share price, he said. Furthermore, it would be easy for nonfinancial firms to establish a front-end structure that could have a bank license that is based on a data-driven business model, but not on the actual value creation, which will happen somewhere else, he said.</p><p>Banks feel threatened by competition from big technology companies that offer a whole range of other services to global customers and could easily include banking offerings. Technology groups such as Apple, Samsung, Google and others are already offering solutions, especially in the payments space. Banks are concerned that in the long run they will lose primary contact with clients to global technology groups.</p><p>Those corporations already have a dominant market position and are not keen on sharing the space, Christian Ossig, CEO of the Association of German Banks, BdB, said during the discussion. He referred to a 2014 speech by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that \"competition is for losers.\"</p><p>\"These big techs, which from a current market perspective are not regulated, might become systemically relevant not only because they have entered the financial services market but because they are also service providers to banks today,\" Ossig said, noting that apart from its 50% market share in e-commerce, Amazon has a significant share of the cloud-services market as well. Therefore, regulators should tighten the rules and think of a new definition of systemic importance, Ossig said.</p><p>No need to 'reinvent the wheel'</p><p>Responding to Ossig's comments, Hufeld said \"the basic idea of redesigning the scope of financial regulation is a must\" and there is a need for an \"engaged dialogue\" to gradually arrive at \"conclusions [on] how to modernize and improve regulation.\"</p><p>However, that must not necessarily mean a fundamental change in definitions. Hufeld cited carmakers as an example, saying that although Volkswagen and Daimler are not under BaFin supervision per se, they have certain ad hoc publication responsibilities that they need to follow. If they breach these responsibilities, the financial regulator gets involved, he said.</p><p>Similar tools that are fit for a broader ecosystem, including nonfinancial companies, could be developed for banking services as well, \"safeguarding the integrity of financial markets regardless whether you are called Google, or Amazon or something else,\" Hufeld said.</p><p>\"It's not at all impossible to create regulatory structures to enlarge the space and scope of financial supervision without having to reinvent the wheel,\" he said.</p><p>Tech-neutral approach is key</p><p>European banks, in particular, are under pressure to digitize their services given their high costs and low profitability, and they are also \"being challenged on all fronts by innovators and third-party institutions,\" said panelist Adam Farkas, executive director at the European Banking Authority.</p><p>Innovators are always striving to become the monopoly in their markets, he said. However, financial regulators cannot impose new rules for all technological innovations that come into the market, he said. They need to monitor closely and understand the new technology businesses and their interconnectedness with the financial services sector to apply targeted rules which would ensure a level playing field, Farkas said.</p><p>\"When virtual currencies became the headlines of the day in 2014, we identified 74 areas of regulation but we decided we should not go that far to regulate the left, right and center of every aspect of them,\" he said.</p><p>In the end, the EBA recommended bringing virtual currency exchanges and wallet providers under the market regulator's remit as they were providing services that in the traditional market space are heavily regulated due to anti-money laundering concerns, Farkas said. \"And that is an example of a level playing field in regulation,\" he said.</p><p>\"Where I would criticize the industry in that sense is that sometimes we feel [banks] are trying to promote the use of financial regulation to block competition and I think that should not be used for defensive purposes,\" Farkas said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLEFD-48376947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLEFD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV0-3X41-F19Y-C2JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">375841</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL European Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While its peers are all more than 15% of their recent highs, and many have dropped 30% or more, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) currently trades just 8% off its all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is shocking. MSFT is typically viewed as similar to the FAANG names i.e. its seen as a mega-cap tech stock with lots of growth opportunities. But while all of the FAANG names are essentially in bear-market territory. MSFT stock isnt even in correction territory.</p><p>The resilience of MSFT is impressive and a testament to the strength of the companys fundamentals. There are a few headwinds that are weighing on mega-cap tech stocks. But none of those headwinds affect MSFT. Instead, MSFT stock is still being powered by continuous tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI) and data which arent slowing all that much.</p><p>MSFT  should be strong for the foreseeable future. The growth of MSFT is powered by AI and data, and it has limited exposure to increased regulation, higher tariffs, and rising interest rates. As a result, as long as AI and data continue to grow rapidly, Microsoft stock will continue to be the most resilient mega-cap tech stock in the market by a long shot.</p><p>Since AI and data will continue to quickly proliferate in the near, medium, and long terms, MSFT stock will both continue to weather the near-term volatility of the tech sector and head significantly higher in the long-run.</p><p>Prevailing Headwinds Wont Affect MSFT</p><p>In simple terms, the headwinds which are dragging down the FAANNG names simply do not apply to Microsoft stock.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is nearly 40% off its all-time highs because of regulation concerns, the slowing growth of its digital ad business, and its increased spending on security which is compressing its margins. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is more than 20% off its all-time highs because of its exposure to tariffs, valuation concerns, and slowing retail growth. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is 25% off its all-time highs because of slowing iPhone demand and plenty of exposure to China and tariffs. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is 35% below its all-time highs because of valuation concerns and the pressure that rising interest rates will place on its debt-loaded balance sheet.</p><p>Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down 50% from its peak due to its exposure to tariffs and the sudden end to the cryptocurrency mining craze. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) has dropped 20% below its all-time highs due to regulation concerns, the slowing growth of its digital ad business, and the fact that its margins are dropping because of a continued shift to mobile ads.</p><p>So there are a few headwinds which are weighing on mega-cap tech stocks. The growth of companies that are exposed to digital ads is under pressure. Rising interest rates are pressuring the stocks of companies with sky-high valuations and those with a bunch of debt. Tariffs are reducing demand for impacted products and pushing costs higher. The cryptocurrency hype has ended, and thats creating a drag on anything related to crypto. And increased regulation of big tech is as big a threat today as its ever been.</p><p>MSFT isnt plagued by any of these headwinds.</p><p>The company has some, but not much, exposure to digital ads through its Bing search engine, so lower prices for digital ads arent catastrophic for Microsoft stock. Meanwhile, MSFT trades at a fairly average forward multiple of 24, and the company has far more cash than debt on its balance sheet. Since the companys valuation and debt levels are reasonable, it shouldnt be hurt much by rising interest rates.</p><p>Also, tariffs werent mentioned once on Microsofts recent earnings conference call, and thats because the company hardly has any exposure to potential tariffs at the moment. MSFT also doesnt have any crypto exposure, nor has it been under the regulation microscope like Facebook and Alphabet.</p><p>Overall, the headwinds which are dragging down big tech stocks simply dont apply to MSFT stock. That is why Microsoft stock has been impressively resilient during this tech stock rout.</p><p>Microsofts Growth Remains Robust</p><p>Whereas the growth of most other mega-cap tech companies is slowing, Microsofts growth is actually accelerating.</p><p>This was the big takeaway from Microsofts strong first-quarter earnings report. Its rapidly growing cloud business remains on fire, and despite the current macroeconomic headwinds, Microsofts overall growth trajectory continues to improve. At the beginning of fiscal 2016, Microsofts revenue was declining. By the beginning of fiscal 2017, its revenues were growing 2%-3%. At the start of fiscal 2018, its revenue growth was in the 10%-plus range. Now, at the start of fiscal 2019, its revenue growth is nearing 20%.</p><p>The acceleration of Microsofts revenue growth has been very impressive, and it is entirely due to Microsofts cloud revolution. This revolution is still in its early innings. It is estimated that only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud thus far. Inevitably, that number will reach 100% in the long-run, implying that Microsofts biggest growth driver has plenty of room to accelerate.</p><p>More importantly, within the cloud sector, Microsoft has become the best-in-class. In the cloud world, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet  are known as the Big Three. But the Big Three is increasingly becoming the Big Two as Microsoft Azure is emerging as a solid runner-up to Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud is becoming a still-formidable but much smaller third wheel. Moreover, Azure is growing far faster than AWS (Azure is growing at a 76% clip versus 46% for AWS), so the big winner in the continuously-growing cloud space right now is Microsoft.</p><p>Because of this, Microsoft stock should benefit from solid and improving growth drivers in both the near-term and the long-term. As the cloud revolution goes global and AI and data become more important than ever, Microsofts growth trajectory will only improve, and MSFT stock will head higher.</p><p>The Bottom Line on MSFT</p><p>The headwinds affecting other mega-cap tech stocks dont apply to MSFT. Meanwhile, the tailwinds keeping other tech stocks at above-average valuations do apply to MSFT stock.</p><p>As a result, Microsoft should remain resilient in the near term and become  a winner in the long-term. 2018 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-131976771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVM-9MK1-F11P-X2B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, September 6th.  Your top stories  right now just after 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Critic in the midst -- President Trump with choice words for the supposed  administration official who wrote a scathing op-ed for the \"New York  Times\".  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  When you tell me about some  anonymous source within the administration, probably who is failing and  probably here for all the wrong reasons.  And the \"New York Times\" is  failing.  If I weren't here, I believe the \"New York Times\" probably  wouldn't even exist.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fallout from the White House this morning coming up. </p><p> Meanwhile, markets are looking higher today, futures indicating a  fractional gain at the start of trading.  But look what's just happened  actually in the last 20 minutes.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have turned  negative; Dow Industrials are up 12, S&amp;P down 1, Nasdaq down 6 -- more of a  mixed story on top of a mixed story yesterday on Wall Street.</p><p> The major indices were mixed with the Dow finishing up 22 points at the  close but the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P were negative.  The Nasdaq down better  than 1 percent yesterday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the indices are also mixed.  FT 100 down 10 points,  the CAC 40 in Paris is up 5 but the DAX index in Germany is down 6.</p><p> Asian markets finished lower overnight -- take a look.  Worst performer  Hong Kong, down about 1 percent.</p><p> Crypto crisis -- bitcoin and other crypto currencies taking a big hit.   We're taking a look at what's behind this slide this morning.</p><p> And a big night for football -- the NFL season opener kicks off tonight.   We will see if the new Colin Kaepernick Nike ad airing in the game will  bench viewers.</p><p> Forget those napkins -- a new grease-proof X-Box controller set to make it  easier for gamers to enjoy snacks while playing the game.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: our own Dagen McDowell; PWC partner Mitch Roschelle; and The  Hill columnist, Fox News contributor Liz Pete.  Great to see everybody this  morning.  </p><p> LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So much to talk about.</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Another busy news day.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And we've got the jobs number out tomorrow.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  We've got ADP today.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the ADP number today on jobs.  We're talking about all  of the gossip coming out of the White House and the name calling.  And  really most Americans want to know about their economic future and the  backdrop there.  We'll get another window into that tomorrow.  </p><p> PETE:  Yes.  And actually the Fed, Atlanta Fed, just came out with a 4.7  percent estimate for the third quarter, which is pretty astounding, right.   That may be why we have this op-ed in the \"New York Times\", by the way,  more good news on the economic front, that has to be countered by  Democrats.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  As he continues to have successes,  particularly economic successes, detractors are going insane.  They're  losing their minds.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I keep a list of all the good  news on the economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is literally just in the past week-and-a-half, maybe 10  days -- 18-year high consumer confidence, the job market.  We actually have  a labor shortage in some ways in this country.  Manufacturing activity --  factory sector strongest growth in 14 years.  I could go on.  But we have  guests.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do.  We have a lot coming up.</p><p> But you're right.  It's the story of the Trump administration, the economic  success that is unnerving his detractors.</p><p> Joining the conversation this morning, we're going to speak with the  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley is  here.  Former senior advisor for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove weighs  in this morning.  Along with Hall of Fame basketball coach, author of  \"Pitino: My Story\", Rick Pitino joining us this morning with that story.   And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well.</p><p> Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.  </p><p> We kick this hour right off with this -- President Trump just tweeting on  North Korea this morning.  He says this.  \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea  proclaims, quote, 'unwavering faith in President Trump'.  Thank you to  Chairman Kim.  We will get it done together.\"</p><p> Yes.  The North Koreans now say they want to denuclearize and the President  there, Kim Jong-un has confidence in President Trump, he says.</p><p> Our top story this hour: resistance from within.  An anonymous \"New York  Times\" op-ed claims to be a top Trump official working to thwart the  President at every turn.  Trump blasting the inside critic in Washington  yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial.  Can  you believe it?  Anonymous -- meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we're  doing a great job.  The poll numbers are through the roof.  Our poll  numbers are great.</p><p> And guess what?  Nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020  because of what we've done.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now to talk more about that is New Jersey  Congressman Leonard Lance.  He's also on the House Energy and Commerce  Committee and he questioned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey yesterday.  We'll get  to that in a moment -- sir.</p><p> Congressman -- thanks very much for joining us this morning.  Good to have  you.  </p><p> REP. LEONARD LANCE (R-NJ), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Thank you  -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this op-ed this morning?  </p><p> LANCE:  I prefer signed op-eds.  And I think that the \"New York Times\"  should have requested who actually wrote it.  And I think it leads to the  opinion of quite a few that we need to have specificity in this area.  And  I would hope that the \"New York Times\" might agree with that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean at this point it's not anything different than  we've heard from the President's detractors.  It's more of the same.  And  this particular op-ed is somebody saying what we've heard from his  detractors for the last year-and-a-half but unwilling to put his name to  it.  </p><p> LANCE:  That is correct.  And let me say, I have great faith in General  Kelly and, for example, in General Mattis.  And certainly I think that the  editorial should have been signed -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what about great faith in President Trump -- sir?  Do you  have faith in him?  </p><p> LANCE:  I agree with the President in some of his policies.  I disagree  with others of his policies.  But regarding the system of government we  have, Maria -- we have checks and balances here in Congress.  Indeed that's  what's occurring at the moment in the Senate with the nomination of Judge  Kavanaugh -- advice and consent.</p><p> And I believe in our system of government.  And As you pointed out at the  top of the hour, the economy is very strong at the moment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the technology CEOs and executives grilled  on Capitol Hill yesterday.  Twitter stock yesterday took a tumble after the  House questioned CEO Jack Dorsey over bias against conservatives.  You  specifically asked him about the algorithm's fairness.  Let's take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  We need to understand as we use this artificial  intelligence for more and more of the things that we do that, number one,  that they're unbiased outcomes; and number two, that they can explain why  they made the decision in the first place.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you feel like you -- do you feel like you got the answers  you were looking for -- Congressman?  </p><p> LANCE:  I think that remains to be seen.  And Mr. Dorsey said Twitter would  be doing a better job in the future.  Was the bias intentional or  unintentional?  I'm not sure.</p><p> But regardless of that, there should not be bias -- Maria.  And it's now  the responsibility of Twitter and other companies -- Google, for example --  to make sure that there is no bias.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I know, but I mean, he's blaming the algorithms and  saying we want the algorithms to be fair.</p><p> I mean we're not stupid.  Algorithms don't come out of magic.  Somebody  programs the algorithms.  Did you get at who is programming the algorithms  and what they're looking at in terms of metrics to put the algorithm  together?  </p><p> LANCE:  He was asked that.  And you're obviously precisely right that this  is based upon human input.  And we want to make sure that human input is in  no way biased against conservatives, for example.</p><p> And I do not believe Twitter has done a good job in the past.  And it has  to do a much better job in the future; and that was the opinion of the  committee.  And that is why Mr. Dorsey came before the committee.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So before we move on -- I want to ask you about the Kavanaugh  hearing -- but before we move on from this, what are the potential  drawbacks for the tech companies?  I mean what can you actually do in terms  of Congress writing a new law?  What do you think plays out from this?  </p><p> LANCE:  Of course, we're the committee of jurisdiction for legislation.  I  am not there yet.  I would prefer to have a situation where there doesn't  need to be further legislation but that remains to be seen, Maria, based  upon what these companies do in the future.</p><p> And incidentally I was disappointed that Google chose not to show up on the  Senate side of the Capitol yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, will you subpoena Google?  Where does that go in terms of  Google just blowing it off?  </p><p> LANCE:  I think it's a decision in the Senate as to whether the Senate  wishes to subpoena.  And I hope regarding future invitations, Google will  come in voluntarily -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- let me switch gears, the Senate heading into day  three of questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  He took a  stance on respecting and enacting the law, congress decides.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  We have to stick to the laws  passed by Congress.  You make the policy.  We'll follow the policy  direction that you put into the laws that are enacted, passed by the House  and Senate, signed by the President.</p><p> We don't rewrite those laws.  The executive branch also shouldn't be  rewriting those laws beyond the scope of the authority granted.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you feel, Congressman -- that you got what you needed from  Kavanaugh yesterday?  </p><p> LANCE:  I certainly agree with Judge Kavanaugh that it's our  responsibility, exclusively, to write legislation and the Supreme Court  should be the umpire.  It's neither the pitcher, nor the batter.</p><p> And this is also true regarding the executive branch.  It shouldn't engage  in action outside the scope of the statutory matters that we have enacted  here on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> And so I agree with Judge Kavanaugh and I think at least so far he's done a  fine job before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, one of the top stories in the \"Wall Street Journal\" this  morning, the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh would not say whether a  president could pardon himself or must comply with a subpoena.  Instead,  promising senators to be an independent justice, unswayed by politics.   Your reaction to that?  </p><p> LANCE:  I think that that is the appropriate stance because it might come  before him.  My own opinion, and I am a lawyer, is that presidents cannot  pardon themselves.  But I'm not been nominated to the Supreme Court, and of  course, he wants to view these matters as they may come before him in the  future.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Congressman -- there was a lot of hysteria over  the lack of documents that the Democrats wanted to see about Judge  Kavanaugh.  And I find it really ironic that here we have Congress on the  left demanding more documents about Judge Kavanaugh and yet the Congress,  the Intel Committee in particular has been asking the FBI and the DOJ for  documents for a year-and-a-half and they haven't gotten those documents and  we don't see that kind of hysteria there.</p><p> What is your take on what's going on in that investigation?  </p><p> LANCE:  I think you make a very good point and I think that Chairman  Grassley is doing an excellent job and he addressed those questions on the  first day.  And Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have  access to documents.</p><p> And I don't think this is different in substantial regard from what  occurred when Justice Kagan came before the court, she of course, having  been Solicitor-General.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting Brett Kavanaugh to get confirmed?  </p><p> LANCE:  I think that that is highly likely to occur and of course the  Senate may have a full complement, since Senator Kyl is coming back to the  Senate based upon the passing of Senator McCain.  And my best estimate at  the moment is that Judge Kavanaugh will become Justice Kavanaugh.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what do you want to see going into the midterms in terms of  priorities for this president?  </p><p> LANCE:  We want to keep the economy strong.  I favor bipartisanship moving  forward in the new term of Congress.  And in the district I serve, the  question I'm asked most is let's be bipartisan.</p><p> And I'm a member of what's known at the Problem Solvers Caucus here on the  House side of the capitol.  And I think we should work in a bipartisan  capacity moving forward.  And that's what the people of the United States  want -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think you're right.  So how does the Problem Solver  Caucus deal with the delays that we saw at the beginning of the Kavanaugh  hearing?  How does the Problem Solver Caucus deal with Senator Kamala  Harris who wanted to stop the whole thing even before it began?  </p><p> LANCE:  The Problem Solvers Caucus is here on the House side but regarding  my Senate colleagues, my distinguished Senate colleagues, I thought that  Chairman Grassley did a terrific job.  And I don't think that Kamala Harris  should have interrupted Chairman Grassley in literally his first paragraph.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> LANCE:  And I think that he is viewed as an incredibly fair chair.  I think  that all would agree with that on Capitol Hill.  And I think that he is  conducting an excellent hearing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So do you think voters will react to what's happening on the  left -- the constant hysteria and resist movement?  Are voters going to  vote against that in November?  </p><p> LANCE:  I think that the American people are in the sensible center, Maria,  and they do not like the partisan bickering back and forth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> LANCE:  I think it's much too extreme and we have to be governed in this  country by the sensible center.  I am a moderate conservative.  And I try  to work with those on the moderate liberal side.</p><p> But I don't think that we should move forward in a manner based upon  constantly interrupting each other. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LANCE:  I do not think that is in the best interest of the American people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much.</p><p> LANCE:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Leonard Lance joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, Nike's controversial debut, it happens tonight.  The backlash as  the athletic company gears up to air the first ad featuring Colin  Kaepernick during the NFL season kick-off game tonight.</p><p> Then calling all gamers, details on the new X-Box grease-proof controller,  taking the Internet by storm.  You can have your greasy chicken wings and  still game.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>South Korea's special envoy saying that Kim Jong-un's trust in President  Trump remains unchanged.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Mari.</p><p> After visiting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, South Korean officials have  said that Kim emphasized that he has never made a negative comment about  President Trump.  They also say that Kim wants to denuclearize his country  before President Trump's current term ends in early 2021.</p><p> And they set up a summit for September 18th through the 20th -- that's  going to be in Pyongyang between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae- in.  That's going to be their third meeting since April.</p><p> Meanwhile President Trump tweeted this morning, \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea  proclaims unwavering faith in President Trump.  Thank you to Chairman Kim.   We will get it done together.\"</p><p> Well, American Express reportedly under investigation by the FBI.  \"The  Wall Street Journal\" says that the FBI is looking into foreign exchange  transactions at the company and whether the international payments  department there misrepresented the pricing to the clients they were trying  to get more business they say.  The newspaper says the inquiry is right now  in the early stages.  Shares of American Express fell more than 1 percent  yesterday. </p><p> Well, crypto currencies getting hammered again today.  Bitcoin has fallen  more than 12 percent in the last 24 hours.  Some are blaming the downturn  on reports that Goldman Sachs has given up on plans to create a crypto  currency trading desk.  But the crypto markets are prone to wild swings and  flash crashes as we know by now.  Bitcoin down about 8 percent at this  hour, it's sitting right now at $6,398 -- $6,400 live on your screen.</p><p> And then there is this, we are soon going to know -- I mean I think we kind  of know what's going to happen to Kevin Spacey's character on \"House of  Cards\" for the sixth and final season.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROBIN WRIGHT, ACTRESS:  When they bury me it won't be in my backyard.  And  when they pay their respects they'll have to wait in line.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Oh, yes.  Robin Wright's character, Claire Underwood is standing  over the grave of her husband, Frank Underwood, who was played by Spacey,  of course, in we think the backyard.  Killing off (INAUDIBLE) might not be  as big a surprise for any of you, if you love the show.  Netflix cut ties  with Spacey last November after he was accused of sexual misconduct.</p><p> New season, Maria -- Netflix, November 2nd.  My favorite line from the  finale from last season was Claire said, \"It's my turn.\" </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was her.</p><p> CASONE:  It is.  </p><p> PETE:  That was her final line.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love it.  I'm excited about it.  Are you still excited about  it?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Robin Wright was the reason that I watched it anyway because  Kevin Spacey increasingly sounded like fog horn leg horn.  That was where  his acting was going.  </p><p> PETE:  And you don't like fog horn.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, it's like -- it's a caricature of a southerner.  \"I'm  Frank Underwood\".  You make Jeff Sessions sound like he's from south  Boston.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm excited about this.  November 2nd.  Ok, we're going to  watch that.</p><p> Meanwhile, we've got this -- breaking news, Vice President Pence's chief of  staff is tweeting out this denial after speculation that Pence may have had  a hand in the anonymous op-ed.  Here's what he's writing.  Jarrod AGen says  \"The Vice President puts his name on his op-eds.  The 'New York Times'  should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical  and gutless op-ed.  Our office is above such amateur acts.\"</p><p> We will take a break.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  More reaction, President Trump is tweeting again  this morning.  He says this right now, \"The deep state and the left and  their vehicle, the fake news media, are going crazy and they don't know  what to do.  The economy is booming like never before.  Jobs are at  historic highs.  Soon two Supreme Court justices and maybe declassification  to find additional corruption.  Wow.\"</p><p> That's my take on it, for sure.  That's why I think this op-ed is coming  out now, because he's having too many successes.</p><p> Meanwhile, the NFL season kicks off tonight amid more controversy.  Jared  Max is here with those details.  Jared -- good morning to you.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS:  Another wow.</p><p> Colin Kaepernick hasn't been a football player since 2016, but he may be  the most talked about figure we will see during tonight's season opener  between the Super Bowl champion Eagles and Atlanta Falcons.</p><p> Yesterday Kaepernick shared a new Nike commercial that will air during  NBC's broadcast tonight.  It's narrated by and features the athlete turned  activist.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  So don't ask if your dreams are  crazy.  Ask if they're crazy enough.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Don't ask if you're crazy; ask if you're crazy enough.  In this two  minute ad, Kaepernick narrates inspirational blurbs about athletes who  overcame unfavorable odds to achieve unprecedented athletic greatness.  And  then he gets tight into the message.</p><p> You remember Nate Boyer -- a veteran Green Beret, served multiple tours in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  A former NFL player convinced Kaepernick two years  ago to kneel instead of sitting.  There's never been a negative connotation  to taking a knee before.</p><p> He took issue with Colin's Nike ad for saying he sacrificed everything.  He  says \"It's dangerous territory to suggest something like that.  For me when  I hear sacrifice everything, the last thing I think about is money.  If  it's a matter of sacrificing money or your brand, that's far different than  sacrificing your life.</p><p> One of the athletes featured in the Nike ad, linebacker Shaquem Griffin,  who had his left hand amputated when he was a young child, a result of  pregnancy complications.  Now, a rook, he will be making his first start,  named a starter for the Seahawks against the Broncos, Sunday.</p><p> Tennis anyone?  Novak Djokovic entered the semifinals at the U.S. Open.   Last night Novak defeated John Millman, the guy who beat Federer in  straight sets.  So he will face K. Nishikori in the semis.</p><p>American Madison Keys also won which means we are on course for a possible  all-American women's final between Keys and Serena Williams.  The women's  semis are today.</p><p> Did you ever see a home run hit 505 feet?  Trevor Story of the (INAUDIBLE)  leading Colorado Rockies last night hit three.  This one traveled further  than any homer since Statcast began to track them three years ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Trevor Story, one more than Arenado has 94 now with the  two home runs tonight.  And then Story (INAUDIBLE) -- how about number  three?  Are you kidding me?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Trevor Story -- what a story.  Rockies lead the NOS (ph) by two.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good stories today -- Jared.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was clapping for Shaqueam Griffin. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MAX:  Yes, awesome stories.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He plays with his brother Shaquill Griffin.  And I noted his  performance during the NFL combine and predicted that he would get drafted  by the Seahawks.</p><p> MAX:  He's playing (ph) with a prosthetic hand.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the game should be interesting tonight with the new Nike  ad.  In my opinion, the people who are sacrificing everything are the  people who are going to fight for the freedoms of America.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Those people who actually decide -- </p><p> PETE:  Hear, hear.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- to sacrifice things and go fight in Afghanistan, in Iran,  and everywhere else in the Middle East, Iraq.  I mean, it's ridiculous to  say he sacrificed everything.  </p><p> MAX:  I also thing it was ridiculous that he got tied into this ad talking  about athletes.  I don't know where he fits in.  And for my money it seemed  like they completely ripped off a beautiful commercial that was made by  Apple over 20 years ago with the whole \"to the crazy ones campaign\".  I  mean to me I'm like is this plagiarized?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You used the right word, commercial.  This is, as I said earlier  this week, this is a business calculation.  They did the risk-reward  analysis.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" actually wrote a great herd (ph) on  the Street about it, that Nike is worried about losing its cultural  relevancy. </p><p> They don't care about older customers.  They're trying to be progressive  and about new customers and about choosing controversy over obscurity.</p><p> MAX:  I guess they figure they could fool the younger audience.  I don't  know.  I don't know where he's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Colin Kaepernick -- </p><p> PETE:  They're targeting 17 and 19 year-olds or whatever who like  disruption, who like this idea of being very challenging.  My view is, they  could have selected, to your point a vet who has an amputated leg and who  is participating in the various kinds of special Olympics and so forth.</p><p> I mean I think there are so many alternatives that could have fit their  bill -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PETE:  -- and not divided their customer base because that's what this is  going to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Colin Kaepernick should join the military.  </p><p> MAX:  He should join something and start to speak.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Adidas overnight gained.  Nike's sales went down three out  of the last four quarters.  That's why they're doing it because we're still  sitting here talking about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.

You own a car  to pick up the kids at school.  You own a car to get groceries, etcetera.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  And we're building out services to solve each of those use  cases and ultimately make it -- make it unnecessary for you to own a car.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will have more from our first on Fox Business interview in  just a few minutes.  Futures this morning showing the markets will open  mixed this morning.  Take a look at where we're looking.  The Dow  Industrials up about 20 points today, S&amp;P 500 up a quarter point, but the  NASDAQ is negative going into the open, two hours away.</p><p> After a mixed day on Wall Street yesterday, markets as you can see were  fractionally moving with the Dow up 22, S&amp;P down eight, but the NASDAQ was  the big story as the technology executives testified on Capitol Hill, the  NASDAQ was down better than one percent.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  FT-100 down 12 points, CAC  Quarante up 13 and the DAX Index in Germany up 15.</p><p> Checking the Asian markets finishing lower overnight across the board, the  worst performer Hong Kong.

All those  stories coming up this Thursday morning.  </p><p> But first, the future of Uber.  In a first time Fox Business interview,  Uber's CEO is speaking out on the path for the ride hailing company to go  public.  Susan Li got the exclusive interview and she's here with the  details, Susan.</p><p> LI:  Good morning to you.  So, 2019 seems to be on track for one of the  largest IPOs in the world.  Uber valued at close to $70 billion.  And of  course, I had to ask Dara Khosrowshahi if he is indeed going public next  year.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LI:  People want to know, are you still sticking with your time line of an  IPO in the back half of 2019?  Because your new CFO who will start in a few  days.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Nelson, he's starting next week.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, he says he's not on-board yet though for 2019 listing.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would expect nothing less of Nelson.  He's independent- minded.  He's rigorous.  And so far he's on the outside.  So I think, I  absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the  work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we are ready  for a 2019 IPO.  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  There's a bunch of system for that going on, financial work  that's going on.  The company is big enough.  The company is incredibly  important to the world.</p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  And we have some incredibly talented technologists out  there.  So, I think we're going to be ready but I absolutely want that  stamp of approval from the CFO.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, there's always a but.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes.</p><p> LI:  Lyft wants to also IPO in March or April next year.  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  So we hear, yes.</p><p> LI:  And the thinking on the street is if they IPO before you, they  basically take up all the IPO capital in the market.  Are you concerned?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I'm not concerned.  Listen, this is Lyft and ourselves are  part of a transportation revolution.  This is about ultimately ending car  ownership.  </p><p> The transportation market is a $6 trillion business.  You may think that  Uber is big but we're $50 billion.  We account for less than one percent of  miles driven and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to  break apart all the use cases of owning a car.  You own a car to get to  work.  You own a car to pick up the kids at school.  You own a car to get  groceries, etcetera.  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  And we're building out services to solve each of those use  cases and ultimately make it -- make it unnecessary for you to own a car.   And we think there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that  revolution.</p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  And I think investors are going to line up behind us and  Lyft.  I certainly hope they are.  </p><p> LI:  So you're guaranteeing a 2019 IPO?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  There's no guarantee.  You don't know what the market is  doing.   LI:  80 percent?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I can guarantee you that we'll be ready and we want to --  and hopefully, the markets will be ready for us.</p><p> LI:  So, you talked about how big Uber is in the ride hailing services.   Some say you own 73 percent of the market.  Given that the U.S. President  has talked about anti-trust situation with the big tech companies like  Google, Amazon, and Facebook.  Do you think that big tech companies like  Uber might be regulated in the future?  Might be broken up?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  Well, we're regulated -- listen, we're regulated now, right?  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  We work in every single city etcetera.  We look at the  market as the $6 trillion transportation market.  We're tiny, tiny, tiny  part of the market.  We account for less than one percent of miles driven  on the road.  </p><p> LI:  Right.</p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  So, I think Uber can be ultimately 20, 30 times bigger than  it is today.  </p><p> LI:  So, no fear of being broken up at all?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  No fear of being broken up.  And listen, I think that  ultimately regulators are our partners.  </p><p> LI:  Talking to our audience, you know, there's been a lot of concern about  political bias in Silicon Valley.  You're a giant, your respectable voice  in Silicon Valley.  So, I have to ask you this question.  President Trump  thinks that there's a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with big tech  companies.  Employees and big tech companies have said that they feel that  their conservative voices have been silenced.  Do you think that's true?  </p><p> KHOSROWSHAHI:  I guarantee you that your wait times for your Uber are going  to be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat.  I don't think --  listen, I think that bias sees -- if there's a bias, I don't think that it  is a bias on purpose.  </p><p> We as a -- as a company, as a leadership team have been trained on bias as  we're -- as well.  And there's some implicit biases that you may not be  aware of as a person and I think awareness is step one.  So, I don't think  that there's any bias on purpose but if you have a bunch of like-minded  people building product, you may get product that's shaped in one way or  the other.  </p><p> That's why for example, from our standpoint, we want to have more women, we  want to have more under-represented people working as engineers and product  people and have representation at all parts of our company so that the  products that we're building reflect our driver partners and our rider  partners and aren't with any biases that we're not aware of.  </p><p> So, listen, we're human.  All of us are vulnerable.  I think that all of  these companies are trying to do the right thing but they've got some  learning to do and I think the way that they operate going forward has to  change.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great interview.  And we will be showing you more of that  interview of Susan's throughout the day.  And Susan, I thought it was  really interesting that he's talking about this company potentially getting  20 to 30 times bigger.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, you imagine that Uber valued at close to 70 billion.  He was  under selling himself a little bit.  That's a really huge company.  But  there's just so much more potential because we're doing a lot of things,  not just ride hailing.  You know, they're n to flying taxis which he says  will be around in five years, believe it or not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's funny.</p><p> LI:  Yes, autonomous vehicles, they're still spending a lot of money trying  to develop self-driving cars.  And I would say that yes, they're just  thinking of different ways, like scooters and bikes in the future as well.   So it's not just cars.  And he doesn't think you need to own your own car  or your own transportation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's also his personality though, and the fact that people do  love working for this guy.  </p><p> LI:  They love him.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  When he talks about women that's very important.  Because under  Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber.</p><p> LI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was common knowledge that for women it was a hostile work  environment.  We've learned more detail about exactly what was going on  there in recent years.  Nevertheless, they couldn't hide -- no woman wanted  to go work there.  </p><p> LI:  But there was accusations of misogyny.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> LI:  And also sexual harassment claims as well.  But I covered him at  Expedia.  He was Expedia's CEO for 10 years, most loved, most liked, most  respected, charismatic man, and he's brought that to Uber.  Because after  the presentation when he went downstairs after all the interviews, a big  round of applause.  And I -- it's rare --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> LI:  -- in the corporate world.  And he's just a likable guy.  They just  want to rally for him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got new features, an emergency button fro drivers.  </p><p> LI:  That's right.  So, they were here in New York in the Midtown Manhattan  event to launch their new safety features for passengers and riders.  So,  it's something called ride check in the feature.  If you're on a ride, they  will basically use the sensors off your smartphone to detect if you've been  in an accident, if it takes longer than usual.  If you're making extra  stops, just to make sure everyone's OK.  </p><p> They'll also mask your location, your pick-up and drop-off locations and  your phone numbers to make sure no one else has access to that information.   Because as a woman or anyone really riding, you want to be safe at the end  of the day, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, that's number one.  Susa, great interview.  </p><p> LI:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for bringing that to us.  Susan Li there.</p><p> Coming up, Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino will join us.  He'll  discuss life off the basketball court.  And why he's done coaching, he  says, that's coming up. </p><p> Then, ranking your college education.  We're revealing the university that  came out on top this year.  You'll want to see this list, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trucks abandoned as a wildfire rages around a  California highway.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  What a scene, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, you thought these fires were over, Maria.  This is the Delta  fire.  It just erupted yesterday afternoon.  It's burned through nearly  eight square miles of timber and brush on both sides of Interstate five.   All of this is just north of Redding, Northern California.  </p><p> Now, according to California Highway Patrol, about 17 semitrailers have  been left behind at this point.  You can see some of that video there.  At  least four of them had caught fire.  The drivers were able to evacuate  safely.  </p><p> Well, CBS reportedly is holding talks with its majority shareholder, Shari  Redstone National Amusements over which company should gain control of the  broadcast network.  Sources are telling the Wall Street Journal that the  talks come less than a month before the dispute has to go to trial.  After  CBS led by Les Moonves sued National Amusements in an attempt to lower its  stake in the company in CBS.  </p><p> Redstone currently controls about 79 percent of CBS.  The stock is down  about 10 percent so far this year.  </p><p> Well, Harvard University taking the top spot in the Wall Street Journal  times higher education college rankings for the second straight year.  The  rankings indicate how well colleges prepare students for life after  graduation.  MIT came in second place after Harvard, followed by Yale,  Columbia and California Institute of technology.  That rounded out the top  five.  </p><p> Running down the list by the way, the top 10, Stanford, Brown and Duke tied  for seventh place.  Followed by Princeton and the University of  Pennsylvania.  </p><p> All right.  Good news for you gamers out there.  Xbox is coming out with a  grease-proof controller.  Now you can eat that bucket of chicken, that  greasy pizza, those chicken wings without worrying about ruining your  device.  Unfortunately, this is only being offered for limited edition in  Australia.  It's part of a marketing campaign for the game PlayerUnknown's  Battleground.  So if you're not in Australia, you can always put order the  official Xbox one wireless controller, that's hitting shelves October 30th.   But we've the grease of chicken on the side.  Shares of Sony, which makes  the Xbox, up 23 percent so far this year, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, good to know that.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, it's important information.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  You need a dog-proof one too.  Often eaten by dogs.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, they step on it.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I step on them.  The dog chews on them.  </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I'd like to see the grease accumulator on  some of the ones that have come back.  I mean that's really the interesting  sort of data point, right?  What do they look like?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino is here.   He'll discuss his new book Life Off the basketball court and why he's done  with coaching.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Life off of the court, former Louisville  Cardinals men's basketball coach Rick Pitino is out with a new book.   Documenting his coaching career and the recruiting scandal which shook  college basketball, you may remember.  </p><p> Joining us now is Hall of Fame basketball coach and the author of Pitino,  My Story, Rick Pitino.  Rick, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.  </p><p> RICK PITINO, HALL OF FAME BASKETBALL  COACH, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE:   Well, thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you said you recently -- you were done with coaching.   Let's start there, what led to that decision?  </p><p> PITINO:  Well, a lot of thought.  I love coaching.  The passion of it, love  being on the sidelines, just worship March Madness.  I just think that's  about the greatest month in all sports.  But I realized that after the  Southern District of New York put my name in a complaint and involved me  with something I was totally foreign to, it would be unfair for any college  to hire me.  Because you start out at a press conference, the colleges all  excited to have you, the student bodies all excited and then they bring up  two scandals.  So, I think it's best to close the book on that and to get  on with something else that's stimulating in my life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you walk us through how that felt for you?  Tell us about  the scandal and what happened.  </p><p> PITINO:  Well, all of a sudden my two assistant coaches are picked up by  the FBI and then they come and visit me and said do you want an attorney  present.  I said, for what?  They explained to me what happened.  And  basically, this has been going on since 2014.  They -- somebody was  indicted.  A scam artist, of which some very, very serious things that have  happened to him.  He was a scam artist and he said I can deliver college  basketball coaches to you who are doing it the wrong way.  And like they  all do, he turned in some people.  And then four years later after a lot of  FISA warrants would a lot of investigative work by the FBI, and the  talented men of the FBI.  I don't think they should be dealing with college  basketball assistants.</p><p> They've come away after four years with indicting four assistant coaches.   A couple Adidas representatives, an AAU coach that took money but they  exonerated him because he kept the money, he didn't give it to a prospect.</p><p> And meanwhile, my life has been shaken.  And I'm out of -- I'm out of my  passion.  But the worst part about the whole thing, because I sent my  lawyers in to visit with them and tell them that I've never cheated in a  game of college basketball.  I've never cheated the game itself.  I've just  given a lot to the game, I believe.  </p><p> And their response was interesting, it's look, you damaged this man's life,  his credibility, worked 40 years in the game.  And their response very  callously was we deal with collateral damage all the time.  </p><p> So, I'm waiting for the phone call from them, apologizing.  And everybody  says you're going to wait until you die because it's not happening.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Coach, there's been a lot of talk about potentially paying  college athletes not just basketball players, would that alleviate some of  the noise that's in the system?  </p><p> PITINO:  You know it's -- the problem is, I believe in paying the athletes,  letting them -- by paying -- if I'm a great athlete, I want to do a  commercial, I have the right to do a commercial.  The problem with that is  then cheating comes into that area.  OK, if I'm school X and I want to do a  car commercial.  We'll give you $60,000 instead of the other school giving  you $20,000.  </p><p> So, it's a difficult way to navigate through what to do, what not to do.  I  believe one thing, though.  If parents want to go see their child play and  you're making millions of dollars off that young man's athleticism, they  should be able to have their flights and hotel paid for to go see that  young man play, especially during March Madness in the tournament.  Every  game those parents should be able to be put up in a hotel and if flights  should be paid for.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you said it was unfair to colleges if they took you on as  a coach because of -- it would expose them to the allegations.  But has  anybody really approached you?  Have you -- did you get phone calls from  other colleges or even professional teams?  </p><p> PITINO:  I had two job offers last year.  We talked.  We sat down.  One  president came in and was nice enough to visit with me.  And then there was  another school, I was interested in -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you want to tell us which schools?  </p><p> PITINO:  I'd rather not.  But the other school I was -- I was interested  in.  They called the NCAA and said, can you give us clearance on Rick  Pitino, he did nothing wrong.  Their response to us, we can't investigate  anything until the Southern District of New York is done with their -- with  whatever they're doing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what, do you have a time line in terms of when they're done?   Are they done at this point?  </p><p> PITINO:  I don't know.  I know there's some things are going to trial yet  in September.  Nobody from Louisville, not myself.  I'm not involved in any  way.  And I have no fears about any of that because I know what I've done  with college basketball and I know what I believe in my beliefs in doing it  the right way and we do it like most coaches.  </p><p> By the way, I believe that less than 10 percent of college basketball is  corrupt.  I think 90 percent of college basketball, people do it the right  way, their hearts are with the student athletes.  They want to help those  young men prosper in life.  </p><p> But like any industry, whether it's Wall Street, whether it's the medical  professional, less than 10 percent does it the wrong way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> PITINO:  And that's what needs to be cleaned up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure, we're going to be watching that Rick.  Thanks so much for  joining us, telling us your story.  </p><p> PITINO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you coach.</p><p> PITINO:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rick Pitino there.  </p><p> Still ahead, a major shift for Burberry, the changes headed to the luxury  goods maker.  Next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is Thursday  September 6th.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, September 6th. Your top stories right now just after 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Critic in the midst -- President Trump with choice words for the supposed administration official who wrote a scathing op-ed for the \"New York Times\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration, probably who is failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons. And the \"New York Times\" is failing. If I weren't here, I believe the \"New York Times\" probably wouldn't even exist.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fallout from the White House this morning coming up.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets are looking higher today, futures indicating a fractional gain at the start of trading. But look what's just happened actually in the last 20 minutes. S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have turned negative; Dow Industrials are up 12, S&amp;P down 1, Nasdaq down 6 -- more of a mixed story on top of a mixed story yesterday on Wall Street.</p><p>The major indices were mixed with the Dow finishing up 22 points at the close but the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P were negative. The Nasdaq down better than 1 percent yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices are also mixed. FT 100 down 10 points, the CAC 40 in Paris is up 5 but the DAX index in Germany is down 6.</p><p>Asian markets finished lower overnight -- take a look. Worst performer Hong Kong, down about 1 percent.</p><p>Crypto crisis -- bitcoin and other crypto currencies taking a big hit. We're taking a look at what's behind this slide this morning.</p><p>And a big night for football -- the NFL season opener kicks off tonight.

Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So much to talk about.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Another busy news day.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And we've got the jobs number out tomorrow.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: We've got ADP today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have the ADP number today on jobs. We're talking about all of the gossip coming out of the White House and the name calling. And really most Americans want to know about their economic future and the backdrop there. We'll get another window into that tomorrow.</p><p>PETE: Yes. And actually the Fed, Atlanta Fed, just came out with a 4.7 percent estimate for the third quarter, which is pretty astounding, right. That may be why we have this op-ed in the \"New York Times\", by the way, more good news on the economic front, that has to be countered by Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. As he continues to have successes, particularly economic successes, detractors are going insane. They're losing their minds.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I keep a list of all the good news on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is literally just in the past week-and-a-half, maybe 10 days -- 18-year high consumer confidence, the job market. We actually have a labor shortage in some ways in this country. Manufacturing activity -- factory sector strongest growth in 14 years. I could go on. But we have guests.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we do. We have a lot coming up.</p><p>But you're right. It's the story of the Trump administration, the economic success that is unnerving his detractors.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, we're going to speak with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley is here. Former senior advisor for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove weighs in this morning. Along with Hall of Fame basketball coach, author of \"Pitino: My Story\", Rick Pitino joining us this morning with that story. And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>We kick this hour right off with this -- President Trump just tweeting on North Korea this morning. He says this. \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea proclaims, quote, 'unwavering faith in President Trump'. Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together.\"</p><p>Yes. The North Koreans now say they want to denuclearize and the President there, Kim Jong-un has confidence in President Trump, he says.</p><p>Our top story this hour: resistance from within. An anonymous \"New York Times\" op-ed claims to be a top Trump official working to thwart the President at every turn. Trump blasting the inside critic in Washington yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial. Can you believe it? Anonymous -- meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we're doing a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are great.</p><p>And guess what? Nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me now to talk more about that is New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance. He's also on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and he questioned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey yesterday. We'll get to that in a moment -- sir.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for joining us this morning. Good to have you.</p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R-NJ), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on this op-ed this morning?</p><p>LANCE: I prefer signed op-eds. And I think that the \"New York Times\" should have requested who actually wrote it. And I think it leads to the opinion of quite a few that we need to have specificity in this area. And I would hope that the \"New York Times\" might agree with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean at this point it's not anything different than we've heard from the President's detractors. It's more of the same. And this particular op-ed is somebody saying what we've heard from his detractors for the last year-and-a-half but unwilling to put his name to it.</p><p>LANCE: That is correct. And let me say, I have great faith in General Kelly and, for example, in General Mattis. And certainly I think that the editorial should have been signed -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what about great faith in President Trump -- sir? Do you have faith in him?</p><p>LANCE: I agree with the President in some of his policies. I disagree with others of his policies. But regarding the system of government we have, Maria -- we have checks and balances here in Congress. Indeed that's what's occurring at the moment in the Senate with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh -- advice and consent.</p><p>And I believe in our system of government. And As you pointed out at the top of the hour, the economy is very strong at the moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the technology CEOs and executives grilled on Capitol Hill yesterday. Twitter stock yesterday took a tumble after the House questioned CEO Jack Dorsey over bias against conservatives. You specifically asked him about the algorithm's fairness. Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: We need to understand as we use this artificial intelligence for more and more of the things that we do that, number one, that they're unbiased outcomes; and number two, that they can explain why they made the decision in the first place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you feel like you -- do you feel like you got the answers you were looking for -- Congressman?</p><p>LANCE: I think that remains to be seen. And Mr. Dorsey said Twitter would be doing a better job in the future. Was the bias intentional or unintentional? I'm not sure.</p><p>But regardless of that, there should not be bias -- Maria. And it's now the responsibility of Twitter and other companies -- Google, for example -- to make sure that there is no bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I know, but I mean, he's blaming the algorithms and saying we want the algorithms to be fair.</p><p>I mean we're not stupid. Algorithms don't come out of magic. Somebody programs the algorithms. Did you get at who is programming the algorithms and what they're looking at in terms of metrics to put the algorithm together?</p><p>LANCE: He was asked that. And you're obviously precisely right that this is based upon human input. And we want to make sure that human input is in no way biased against conservatives, for example.</p><p>And I do not believe Twitter has done a good job in the past. And it has to do a much better job in the future; and that was the opinion of the committee. And that is why Mr. Dorsey came before the committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So before we move on -- I want to ask you about the Kavanaugh hearing -- but before we move on from this, what are the potential drawbacks for the tech companies? I mean what can you actually do in terms of Congress writing a new law? What do you think plays out from this?</p><p>LANCE: Of course, we're the committee of jurisdiction for legislation. I am not there yet. I would prefer to have a situation where there doesn't need to be further legislation but that remains to be seen, Maria, based upon what these companies do in the future.</p><p>And incidentally I was disappointed that Google chose not to show up on the Senate side of the Capitol yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, will you subpoena Google? Where does that go in terms of Google just blowing it off?</p><p>LANCE: I think it's a decision in the Senate as to whether the Senate wishes to subpoena. And I hope regarding future invitations, Google will come in voluntarily -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- let me switch gears, the Senate heading into day three of questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. He took a stance on respecting and enacting the law, congress decides. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: We have to stick to the laws passed by Congress. You make the policy. We'll follow the policy direction that you put into the laws that are enacted, passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President.</p><p>We don't rewrite those laws. The executive branch also shouldn't be rewriting those laws beyond the scope of the authority granted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you feel, Congressman -- that you got what you needed from Kavanaugh yesterday?</p><p>LANCE: I certainly agree with Judge Kavanaugh that it's our responsibility, exclusively, to write legislation and the Supreme Court should be the umpire. It's neither the pitcher, nor the batter.</p><p>And this is also true regarding the executive branch. It shouldn't engage in action outside the scope of the statutory matters that we have enacted here on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And so I agree with Judge Kavanaugh and I think at least so far he's done a fine job before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, one of the top stories in the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning, the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh would not say whether a president could pardon himself or must comply with a subpoena. Instead, promising senators to be an independent justice, unswayed by politics. Your reaction to that?</p><p>LANCE: I think that that is the appropriate stance because it might come before him. My own opinion, and I am a lawyer, is that presidents cannot pardon themselves. But I'm not been nominated to the Supreme Court, and of course, he wants to view these matters as they may come before him in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Congressman -- there was a lot of hysteria over the lack of documents that the Democrats wanted to see about Judge Kavanaugh. And I find it really ironic that here we have Congress on the left demanding more documents about Judge Kavanaugh and yet the Congress, the Intel Committee in particular has been asking the FBI and the DOJ for documents for a year-and-a-half and they haven't gotten those documents and we don't see that kind of hysteria there.</p><p>What is your take on what's going on in that investigation?</p><p>LANCE: I think you make a very good point and I think that Chairman Grassley is doing an excellent job and he addressed those questions on the first day. And Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have access to documents.</p><p>And I don't think this is different in substantial regard from what occurred when Justice Kagan came before the court, she of course, having been Solicitor-General.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expecting Brett Kavanaugh to get confirmed?</p><p>LANCE: I think that that is highly likely to occur and of course the Senate may have a full complement, since Senator Kyl is coming back to the Senate based upon the passing of Senator McCain. And my best estimate at the moment is that Judge Kavanaugh will become Justice Kavanaugh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what do you want to see going into the midterms in terms of priorities for this president?</p><p>LANCE: We want to keep the economy strong. I favor bipartisanship moving forward in the new term of Congress. And in the district I serve, the question I'm asked most is let's be bipartisan.</p><p>And I'm a member of what's known at the Problem Solvers Caucus here on the House side of the capitol. And I think we should work in a bipartisan capacity moving forward. And that's what the people of the United States want -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you're right. So how does the Problem Solver Caucus deal with the delays that we saw at the beginning of the Kavanaugh hearing? How does the Problem Solver Caucus deal with Senator Kamala Harris who wanted to stop the whole thing even before it began?</p><p>LANCE: The Problem Solvers Caucus is here on the House side but regarding my Senate colleagues, my distinguished Senate colleagues, I thought that Chairman Grassley did a terrific job. And I don't think that Kamala Harris should have interrupted Chairman Grassley in literally his first paragraph.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>LANCE: And I think that he is viewed as an incredibly fair chair. I think that all would agree with that on Capitol Hill. And I think that he is conducting an excellent hearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you think voters will react to what's happening on the left -- the constant hysteria and resist movement? Are voters going to vote against that in November?</p><p>LANCE: I think that the American people are in the sensible center, Maria, and they do not like the partisan bickering back and forth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>LANCE: I think it's much too extreme and we have to be governed in this country by the sensible center. I am a moderate conservative. And I try to work with those on the moderate liberal side.</p><p>But I don't think that we should move forward in a manner based upon constantly interrupting each other.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LANCE: I do not think that is in the best interest of the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>LANCE: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Leonard Lance joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Nike's controversial debut, it happens tonight. The backlash as the athletic company gears up to air the first ad featuring Colin Kaepernick during the NFL season kick-off game tonight.</p><p>Then calling all gamers, details on the new X-Box grease-proof controller, taking the Internet by storm. You can have your greasy chicken wings and still game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>South Korea's special envoy saying that Kim Jong-un's trust in President Trump remains unchanged.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Mari.</p><p>After visiting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, South Korean officials have said that Kim emphasized that he has never made a negative comment about President Trump. They also say that Kim wants to denuclearize his country before President Trump's current term ends in early 2021.</p><p>And they set up a summit for September 18th through the 20th -- that's going to be in Pyongyang between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae- in. That's going to be their third meeting since April.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump tweeted this morning, \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea proclaims unwavering faith in President Trump. Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together.\"</p><p>Well, American Express reportedly under investigation by the FBI. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that the FBI is looking into foreign exchange transactions at the company and whether the international payments department there misrepresented the pricing to the clients they were trying to get more business they say. The newspaper says the inquiry is right now in the early stages. Shares of American Express fell more than 1 percent yesterday.</p><p>Well, crypto currencies getting hammered again today. Bitcoin has fallen more than 12 percent in the last 24 hours. Some are blaming the downturn on reports that Goldman Sachs has given up on plans to create a crypto currency trading desk. But the crypto markets are prone to wild swings and flash crashes as we know by now. Bitcoin down about 8 percent at this hour, it's sitting right now at $6,398 -- $6,400 live on your screen.</p><p>And then there is this, we are soon going to know -- I mean I think we kind of know what's going to happen to Kevin Spacey's character on \"House of Cards\" for the sixth and final season. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBIN WRIGHT, ACTRESS: When they bury me it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects they'll have to wait in line.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Oh, yes. Robin Wright's character, Claire Underwood is standing over the grave of her husband, Frank Underwood, who was played by Spacey, of course, in we think the backyard. Killing off (INAUDIBLE) might not be as big a surprise for any of you, if you love the show. Netflix cut ties with Spacey last November after he was accused of sexual misconduct.</p><p>New season, Maria -- Netflix, November 2nd. My favorite line from the finale from last season was Claire said, \"It's my turn.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that was her.</p><p>CASONE: It is.</p><p>PETE: That was her final line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. I'm excited about it. Are you still excited about it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Robin Wright was the reason that I watched it anyway because Kevin Spacey increasingly sounded like fog horn leg horn. That was where his acting was going.</p><p>PETE: And you don't like fog horn.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's like -- it's a caricature of a southerner. \"I'm Frank Underwood\". You make Jeff Sessions sound like he's from south Boston.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm excited about this. November 2nd. Ok, we're going to watch that.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got this -- breaking news, Vice President Pence's chief of staff is tweeting out this denial after speculation that Pence may have had a hand in the anonymous op-ed. Here's what he's writing. Jarrod AGen says \"The Vice President puts his name on his op-eds. The 'New York Times' should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical and gutless op-ed. Our office is above such amateur acts.\"</p><p>We will take a break. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. More reaction, President Trump is tweeting again this morning. He says this right now, \"The deep state and the left and their vehicle, the fake news media, are going crazy and they don't know what to do. The economy is booming like never before. Jobs are at historic highs. Soon two Supreme Court justices and maybe declassification to find additional corruption. Wow.\"</p><p>That's my take on it, for sure. That's why I think this op-ed is coming out now, because he's having too many successes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the NFL season kicks off tonight amid more controversy. Jared Max is here with those details. Jared -- good morning to you.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS: Another wow.</p><p>Colin Kaepernick hasn't been a football player since 2016, but he may be the most talked about figure we will see during tonight's season opener between the Super Bowl champion Eagles and Atlanta Falcons.</p><p>Yesterday Kaepernick shared a new Nike commercial that will air during NBC's broadcast tonight. It's narrated by and features the athlete turned activist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER: So don't ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they're crazy enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Don't ask if you're crazy; ask if you're crazy enough. In this two minute ad, Kaepernick narrates inspirational blurbs about athletes who overcame unfavorable odds to achieve unprecedented athletic greatness. And then he gets tight into the message.</p><p>You remember Nate Boyer -- a veteran Green Beret, served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former NFL player convinced Kaepernick two years ago to kneel instead of sitting. There's never been a negative connotation to taking a knee before.</p><p>He took issue with Colin's Nike ad for saying he sacrificed everything. He says \"It's dangerous territory to suggest something like that. For me when I hear sacrifice everything, the last thing I think about is money. If it's a matter of sacrificing money or your brand, that's far different than sacrificing your life.</p><p>One of the athletes featured in the Nike ad, linebacker Shaquem Griffin, who had his left hand amputated when he was a young child, a result of pregnancy complications. Now, a rook, he will be making his first start, named a starter for the Seahawks against the Broncos, Sunday.</p><p>Tennis anyone? Novak Djokovic entered the semifinals at the U.S. Open. Last night Novak defeated John Millman, the guy who beat Federer in straight sets. So he will face K. Nishikori in the semis.</p><p>American Madison Keys also won which means we are on course for a possible all-American women's final between Keys and Serena Williams. The women's semis are today.</p><p>Did you ever see a home run hit 505 feet? Trevor Story of the (INAUDIBLE) leading Colorado Rockies last night hit three. This one traveled further than any homer since Statcast began to track them three years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trevor Story, one more than Arenado has 94 now with the two home runs tonight. And then Story (INAUDIBLE) -- how about number three? Are you kidding me?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Trevor Story -- what a story. Rockies lead the NOS (ph) by two.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good stories today -- Jared.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was clapping for Shaqueam Griffin.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: Yes, awesome stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He plays with his brother Shaquill Griffin. And I noted his performance during the NFL combine and predicted that he would get drafted by the Seahawks.</p><p>MAX: He's playing (ph) with a prosthetic hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the game should be interesting tonight with the new Nike ad. In my opinion, the people who are sacrificing everything are the people who are going to fight for the freedoms of America.</p><p>MAX: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Those people who actually decide --</p><p>PETE: Hear, hear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- to sacrifice things and go fight in Afghanistan, in Iran, and everywhere else in the Middle East, Iraq. I mean, it's ridiculous to say he sacrificed everything.</p><p>MAX: I also thing it was ridiculous that he got tied into this ad talking about athletes. I don't know where he fits in. And for my money it seemed like they completely ripped off a beautiful commercial that was made by Apple over 20 years ago with the whole \"to the crazy ones campaign\". I mean to me I'm like is this plagiarized?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You used the right word, commercial. This is, as I said earlier this week, this is a business calculation. They did the risk-reward analysis. \"The Wall Street Journal\" actually wrote a great herd (ph) on the Street about it, that Nike is worried about losing its cultural relevancy.</p><p>They don't care about older customers. They're trying to be progressive and about new customers and about choosing controversy over obscurity.</p><p>MAX: I guess they figure they could fool the younger audience. I don't know. I don't know where he's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Colin Kaepernick --</p><p>PETE: They're targeting 17 and 19 year-olds or whatever who like disruption, who like this idea of being very challenging. My view is, they could have selected, to your point a vet who has an amputated leg and who is participating in the various kinds of special Olympics and so forth.</p><p>I mean I think there are so many alternatives that could have fit their bill --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETE: -- and not divided their customer base because that's what this is going to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Colin Kaepernick should join the military.</p><p>MAX: He should join something and start to speak.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Adidas overnight gained. Nike's sales went down three out of the last four quarters. That's why they're doing it because we're still sitting here talking about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true. Thank you -- Jared Max.</p><p>All right. Catch Jared's sports reports on FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" or on Sirius Radio, XM115.</p><p>Coming up, the future of Uber.

Futures this morning showing the markets will open mixed this morning. Take a look at where we're looking. The Dow Industrials up about 20 points today, S&amp;P 500 up a quarter point, but the NASDAQ is negative going into the open, two hours away.</p><p>After a mixed day on Wall Street yesterday, markets as you can see were fractionally moving with the Dow up 22, S&amp;P down eight, but the NASDAQ was the big story as the technology executives testified on Capitol Hill, the NASDAQ was down better than one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.

All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.</p><p>But first, the future of Uber. In a first time Fox Business interview, Uber's CEO is speaking out on the path for the ride hailing company to go public. Susan Li got the exclusive interview and she's here with the details, Susan.</p><p>LI: Good morning to you. So, 2019 seems to be on track for one of the largest IPOs in the world. Uber valued at close to $70 billion. And of course, I had to ask Dara Khosrowshahi if he is indeed going public next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI: People want to know, are you still sticking with your time line of an IPO in the back half of 2019? Because your new CFO who will start in a few days.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Nelson, he's starting next week.</p><p>LI: Yes, he says he's not on-board yet though for 2019 listing.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I would expect nothing less of Nelson. He's independent- minded. He's rigorous. And so far he's on the outside. So I think, I absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we are ready for a 2019 IPO.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: There's a bunch of system for that going on, financial work that's going on. The company is big enough. The company is incredibly important to the world.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: And we have some incredibly talented technologists out there. So, I think we're going to be ready but I absolutely want that stamp of approval from the CFO.</p><p>LI: Yes, there's always a but.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Yes.</p><p>LI: Lyft wants to also IPO in March or April next year.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: So we hear, yes.</p><p>LI: And the thinking on the street is if they IPO before you, they basically take up all the IPO capital in the market. Are you concerned?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I'm not concerned. Listen, this is Lyft and ourselves are part of a transportation revolution. This is about ultimately ending car ownership.</p><p>The transportation market is a $6 trillion business. You may think that Uber is big but we're $50 billion. We account for less than one percent of miles driven and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to break apart all the use cases of owning a car. You own a car to get to work. You own a car to pick up the kids at school. You own a car to get groceries, etcetera.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: And we're building out services to solve each of those use cases and ultimately make it -- make it unnecessary for you to own a car. And we think there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that revolution.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: And I think investors are going to line up behind us and Lyft. I certainly hope they are.</p><p>LI: So you're guaranteeing a 2019 IPO?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: There's no guarantee. You don't know what the market is doing. LI: 80 percent?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I can guarantee you that we'll be ready and we want to -- and hopefully, the markets will be ready for us.</p><p>LI: So, you talked about how big Uber is in the ride hailing services. Some say you own 73 percent of the market. Given that the U.S. President has talked about anti-trust situation with the big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Do you think that big tech companies like Uber might be regulated in the future? Might be broken up?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Well, we're regulated -- listen, we're regulated now, right?</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: We work in every single city etcetera. We look at the market as the $6 trillion transportation market. We're tiny, tiny, tiny part of the market. We account for less than one percent of miles driven on the road.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: So, I think Uber can be ultimately 20, 30 times bigger than it is today.</p><p>LI: So, no fear of being broken up at all?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: No fear of being broken up. And listen, I think that ultimately regulators are our partners.</p><p>LI: Talking to our audience, you know, there's been a lot of concern about political bias in Silicon Valley. You're a giant, your respectable voice in Silicon Valley. So, I have to ask you this question. President Trump thinks that there's a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with big tech companies. Employees and big tech companies have said that they feel that their conservative voices have been silenced. Do you think that's true?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I guarantee you that your wait times for your Uber are going to be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat. I don't think -- listen, I think that bias sees -- if there's a bias, I don't think that it is a bias on purpose.</p><p>We as a -- as a company, as a leadership team have been trained on bias as we're -- as well. And there's some implicit biases that you may not be aware of as a person and I think awareness is step one. So, I don't think that there's any bias on purpose but if you have a bunch of like-minded people building product, you may get product that's shaped in one way or the other.</p><p>That's why for example, from our standpoint, we want to have more women, we want to have more under-represented people working as engineers and product people and have representation at all parts of our company so that the products that we're building reflect our driver partners and our rider partners and aren't with any biases that we're not aware of.</p><p>So, listen, we're human. All of us are vulnerable. I think that all of these companies are trying to do the right thing but they've got some learning to do and I think the way that they operate going forward has to change.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great interview. And we will be showing you more of that interview of Susan's throughout the day. And Susan, I thought it was really interesting that he's talking about this company potentially getting 20 to 30 times bigger.</p><p>LI: Yes, you imagine that Uber valued at close to 70 billion. He was under selling himself a little bit. That's a really huge company. But there's just so much more potential because we're doing a lot of things, not just ride hailing. You know, they're n to flying taxis which he says will be around in five years, believe it or not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's funny.</p><p>LI: Yes, autonomous vehicles, they're still spending a lot of money trying to develop self-driving cars. And I would say that yes, they're just thinking of different ways, like scooters and bikes in the future as well. So it's not just cars. And he doesn't think you need to own your own car or your own transportation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's also his personality though, and the fact that people do love working for this guy.</p><p>LI: They love him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When he talks about women that's very important. Because under Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was common knowledge that for women it was a hostile work environment. We've learned more detail about exactly what was going on there in recent years. Nevertheless, they couldn't hide -- no woman wanted to go work there.</p><p>LI: But there was accusations of misogyny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>LI: And also sexual harassment claims as well. But I covered him at Expedia. He was Expedia's CEO for 10 years, most loved, most liked, most respected, charismatic man, and he's brought that to Uber. Because after the presentation when he went downstairs after all the interviews, a big round of applause. And I -- it's rare --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>LI: -- in the corporate world. And he's just a likable guy. They just want to rally for him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They've got new features, an emergency button fro drivers.</p><p>LI: That's right. So, they were here in New York in the Midtown Manhattan event to launch their new safety features for passengers and riders. So, it's something called ride check in the feature. If you're on a ride, they will basically use the sensors off your smartphone to detect if you've been in an accident, if it takes longer than usual. If you're making extra stops, just to make sure everyone's OK.</p><p>They'll also mask your location, your pick-up and drop-off locations and your phone numbers to make sure no one else has access to that information. Because as a woman or anyone really riding, you want to be safe at the end of the day, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course, that's number one. Susa, great interview.</p><p>LI: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for bringing that to us. Susan Li there.</p><p>Coming up, Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino will join us. He'll discuss life off the basketball court. And why he's done coaching, he says, that's coming up.</p><p>Then, ranking your college education. We're revealing the university that came out on top this year. You'll want to see this list, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Trucks abandoned as a wildfire rages around a California highway. Cheryl Casone with the details. What a scene, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, you thought these fires were over, Maria. This is the Delta fire. It just erupted yesterday afternoon. It's burned through nearly eight square miles of timber and brush on both sides of Interstate five. All of this is just north of Redding, Northern California.</p><p>Now, according to California Highway Patrol, about 17 semitrailers have been left behind at this point. You can see some of that video there. At least four of them had caught fire. The drivers were able to evacuate safely.</p><p>Well, CBS reportedly is holding talks with its majority shareholder, Shari Redstone National Amusements over which company should gain control of the broadcast network. Sources are telling the Wall Street Journal that the talks come less than a month before the dispute has to go to trial. After CBS led by Les Moonves sued National Amusements in an attempt to lower its stake in the company in CBS.</p><p>Redstone currently controls about 79 percent of CBS.

The rankings indicate how well colleges prepare students for life after graduation. MIT came in second place after Harvard, followed by Yale, Columbia and California Institute of technology.

Followed by Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>All right. Good news for you gamers out there. Xbox is coming out with a grease-proof controller. Now you can eat that bucket of chicken, that greasy pizza, those chicken wings without worrying about ruining your device. Unfortunately, this is only being offered for limited edition in Australia.

Thanks so much.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, it's important information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: You need a dog-proof one too. Often eaten by dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, they step on it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I step on them. The dog chews on them.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'd like to see the grease accumulator on some of the ones that have come back. I mean that's really the interesting sort of data point, right? What do they look like?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino is here. He'll discuss his new book Life Off the basketball court and why he's done with coaching. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Life off of the court, former Louisville Cardinals men's basketball coach Rick Pitino is out with a new book. Documenting his coaching career and the recruiting scandal which shook college basketball, you may remember.</p><p>Joining us now is Hall of Fame basketball coach and the author of Pitino, My Story, Rick Pitino. Rick, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RICK PITINO, HALL OF FAME BASKETBALL COACH, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE: Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you said you recently -- you were done with coaching. Let's start there, what led to that decision?</p><p>PITINO: Well, a lot of thought. I love coaching. The passion of it, love being on the sidelines, just worship March Madness. I just think that's about the greatest month in all sports. But I realized that after the Southern District of New York put my name in a complaint and involved me with something I was totally foreign to, it would be unfair for any college to hire me. Because you start out at a press conference, the colleges all excited to have you, the student bodies all excited and then they bring up two scandals. So, I think it's best to close the book on that and to get on with something else that's stimulating in my life.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you walk us through how that felt for you? Tell us about the scandal and what happened.</p><p>PITINO: Well, all of a sudden my two assistant coaches are picked up by the FBI and then they come and visit me and said do you want an attorney present. I said, for what? They explained to me what happened. And basically, this has been going on since 2014. They -- somebody was indicted. A scam artist, of which some very, very serious things that have happened to him. He was a scam artist and he said I can deliver college basketball coaches to you who are doing it the wrong way. And like they all do, he turned in some people. And then four years later after a lot of FISA warrants would a lot of investigative work by the FBI, and the talented men of the FBI. I don't think they should be dealing with college basketball assistants.</p><p>They've come away after four years with indicting four assistant coaches. A couple Adidas representatives, an AAU coach that took money but they exonerated him because he kept the money, he didn't give it to a prospect.</p><p>And meanwhile, my life has been shaken. And I'm out of -- I'm out of my passion. But the worst part about the whole thing, because I sent my lawyers in to visit with them and tell them that I've never cheated in a game of college basketball. I've never cheated the game itself. I've just given a lot to the game, I believe.</p><p>And their response was interesting, it's look, you damaged this man's life, his credibility, worked 40 years in the game. And their response very callously was we deal with collateral damage all the time.</p><p>So, I'm waiting for the phone call from them, apologizing. And everybody says you're going to wait until you die because it's not happening.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Coach, there's been a lot of talk about potentially paying college athletes not just basketball players, would that alleviate some of the noise that's in the system?</p><p>PITINO: You know it's -- the problem is, I believe in paying the athletes, letting them -- by paying -- if I'm a great athlete, I want to do a commercial, I have the right to do a commercial. The problem with that is then cheating comes into that area. OK, if I'm school X and I want to do a car commercial. We'll give you $60,000 instead of the other school giving you $20,000.</p><p>So, it's a difficult way to navigate through what to do, what not to do. I believe one thing, though. If parents want to go see their child play and you're making millions of dollars off that young man's athleticism, they should be able to have their flights and hotel paid for to go see that young man play, especially during March Madness in the tournament. Every game those parents should be able to be put up in a hotel and if flights should be paid for.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you said it was unfair to colleges if they took you on as a coach because of -- it would expose them to the allegations. But has anybody really approached you? Have you -- did you get phone calls from other colleges or even professional teams?</p><p>PITINO: I had two job offers last year. We talked. We sat down. One president came in and was nice enough to visit with me. And then there was another school, I was interested in --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you want to tell us which schools?</p><p>PITINO: I'd rather not. But the other school I was -- I was interested in. They called the NCAA and said, can you give us clearance on Rick Pitino, he did nothing wrong. Their response to us, we can't investigate anything until the Southern District of New York is done with their -- with whatever they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what, do you have a time line in terms of when they're done? Are they done at this point?</p><p>PITINO: I don't know. I know there's some things are going to trial yet in September. Nobody from Louisville, not myself. I'm not involved in any way. And I have no fears about any of that because I know what I've done with college basketball and I know what I believe in my beliefs in doing it the right way and we do it like most coaches.</p><p>By the way, I believe that less than 10 percent of college basketball is corrupt. I think 90 percent of college basketball, people do it the right way, their hearts are with the student athletes. They want to help those young men prosper in life.</p><p>But like any industry, whether it's Wall Street, whether it's the medical professional, less than 10 percent does it the wrong way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>PITINO: And that's what needs to be cleaned up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure, we're going to be watching that Rick. Thanks so much for joining us, telling us your story.</p><p>PITINO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good luck.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you coach.</p><p>PITINO: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rick Pitino there.</p><p>Still ahead, a major shift for Burberry, the changes headed to the luxury goods maker. Next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Thursday to you. It is Thursday September 6th. Your top stories right now just after 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018090602cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6J-J5D1-DXH2-637V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 6, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Advertising</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dara Khosrowshahi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Uber</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IPO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Harvard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wall Street Journal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>College</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>School</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rick Pitino</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Car</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lyft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Basketball</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Coaches</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzcwQkQ0Q0E1NEJCNEY1M0JFRTBFQzY0NjBENEYxNjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzBBQzFGOUQ2NzlGNDMzMUEwQ0IxNTdDOTNFQ0Y2QjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

We will see if the new Colin Kaepernick Nike ad airing in the game will  bench viewers.</p><p>Forget those napkins -- a new grease-proof X-Box controller set to make it  easier for gamers to enjoy snacks while playing the game.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: our own Dagen McDowell; PWC partner Mitch Roschelle; and The  Hill columnist, Fox News contributor Liz Pete.  Great to see everybody this  morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much to talk about.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Another busy news day.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And we've got the jobs number out tomorrow.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  We've got ADP today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the ADP number today on jobs.  We're talking about all  of the gossip coming out of the White House and the name calling.  And  really most Americans want to know about their economic future and the  backdrop there.  We'll get another window into that tomorrow.  </p><p>PETE:  Yes.  And actually the Fed, Atlanta Fed, just came out with a 4.7  percent estimate for the third quarter, which is pretty astounding, right.   That may be why we have this op-ed in the \"New York Times\", by the way,  more good news on the economic front, that has to be countered by  Democrats.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  As he continues to have successes,  particularly economic successes, detractors are going insane.  They're  losing their minds.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I keep a list of all the good  news on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is literally just in the past week-and-a-half, maybe 10  days -- 18-year high consumer confidence, the job market.  We actually have  a labor shortage in some ways in this country.  Manufacturing activity --  factory sector strongest growth in 14 years.  I could go on.  But we have  guests.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do.  We have a lot coming up.</p><p>But you're right.  It's the story of the Trump administration, the economic  success that is unnerving his detractors.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, we're going to speak with the  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley is  here.  Former senior advisor for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove weighs  in this morning.  Along with Hall of Fame basketball coach, author of  \"Pitino: My Story\", Rick Pitino joining us this morning with that story.   And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.  </p><p>We kick this hour right off with this -- President Trump just tweeting on  North Korea this morning.  He says this.  \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea  proclaims, quote, 'unwavering faith in President Trump'.  Thank you to  Chairman Kim.  We will get it done together.\"</p><p>Yes.  The North Koreans now say they want to denuclearize and the President  there, Kim Jong-un has confidence in President Trump, he says.</p><p>Our top story this hour: resistance from within.  An anonymous \"New York  Times\" op-ed claims to be a top Trump official working to thwart the  President at every turn.  Trump blasting the inside critic in Washington  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial.  Can  you believe it?  Anonymous -- meaning gutless, a gutless editorial -- we're  doing a great job.  The poll numbers are through the roof.  Our poll  numbers are great.</p><p>And guess what?  Nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020  because of what we've done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now to talk more about that is New Jersey  Congressman Leonard Lance.  He's also on the House Energy and Commerce  Committee and he questioned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey yesterday.  We'll get  to that in a moment -- sir.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for joining us this morning.  Good to have  you.  </p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R-NJ), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Thank you  -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this op-ed this morning?  </p><p>LANCE:  I prefer signed op-eds.  And I think that the \"New York Times\"  should have requested who actually wrote it.  And I think it leads to the  opinion of quite a few that we need to have specificity in this area.  And  I would hope that the \"New York Times\" might agree with that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean at this point it's not anything different than  we've heard from the President's detractors.  It's more of the same.  And  this particular op-ed is somebody saying what we've heard from his  detractors for the last year-and-a-half but unwilling to put his name to  it.  </p><p>LANCE:  That is correct.  And let me say, I have great faith in General  Kelly and, for example, in General Mattis.  And certainly I think that the  editorial should have been signed -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what about great faith in President Trump -- sir?  Do you  have faith in him?  </p><p>LANCE:  I agree with the President in some of his policies.  I disagree  with others of his policies.  But regarding the system of government we  have, Maria -- we have checks and balances here in Congress.  Indeed that's  what's occurring at the moment in the Senate with the nomination of Judge  Kavanaugh -- advice and consent.</p><p>And I believe in our system of government.  And As you pointed out at the  top of the hour, the economy is very strong at the moment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the technology CEOs and executives grilled  on Capitol Hill yesterday.  Twitter stock yesterday took a tumble after the  House questioned CEO Jack Dorsey over bias against conservatives.  You  specifically asked him about the algorithm's fairness.  Let's take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  We need to understand as we use this artificial  intelligence for more and more of the things that we do that, number one,  that they're unbiased outcomes; and number two, that they can explain why  they made the decision in the first place.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you feel like you -- do you feel like you got the answers  you were looking for -- Congressman?  </p><p>LANCE:  I think that remains to be seen.  And Mr. Dorsey said Twitter would  be doing a better job in the future.  Was the bias intentional or  unintentional?  I'm not sure.</p><p>But regardless of that, there should not be bias -- Maria.  And it's now  the responsibility of Twitter and other companies -- Google, for example --  to make sure that there is no bias.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I know, but I mean, he's blaming the algorithms and  saying we want the algorithms to be fair.</p><p>I mean we're not stupid.  Algorithms don't come out of magic.  Somebody  programs the algorithms.  Did you get at who is programming the algorithms  and what they're looking at in terms of metrics to put the algorithm  together?  </p><p>LANCE:  He was asked that.  And you're obviously precisely right that this  is based upon human input.  And we want to make sure that human input is in  no way biased against conservatives, for example.</p><p>And I do not believe Twitter has done a good job in the past.  And it has  to do a much better job in the future; and that was the opinion of the  committee.  And that is why Mr. Dorsey came before the committee.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So before we move on -- I want to ask you about the Kavanaugh  hearing -- but before we move on from this, what are the potential  drawbacks for the tech companies?  I mean what can you actually do in terms  of Congress writing a new law?  What do you think plays out from this?  </p><p>LANCE:  Of course, we're the committee of jurisdiction for legislation.  I  am not there yet.  I would prefer to have a situation where there doesn't  need to be further legislation but that remains to be seen, Maria, based  upon what these companies do in the future.</p><p>And incidentally I was disappointed that Google chose not to show up on the  Senate side of the Capitol yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, will you subpoena Google?  Where does that go in terms of  Google just blowing it off?  </p><p>LANCE:  I think it's a decision in the Senate as to whether the Senate  wishes to subpoena.  And I hope regarding future invitations, Google will  come in voluntarily -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- let me switch gears, the Senate heading into day  three of questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  He took a  stance on respecting and enacting the law, congress decides.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  We have to stick to the laws  passed by Congress.  You make the policy.  We'll follow the policy  direction that you put into the laws that are enacted, passed by the House  and Senate, signed by the President.</p><p>We don't rewrite those laws.  The executive branch also shouldn't be  rewriting those laws beyond the scope of the authority granted.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you feel, Congressman -- that you got what you needed from  Kavanaugh yesterday?  </p><p>LANCE:  I certainly agree with Judge Kavanaugh that it's our  responsibility, exclusively, to write legislation and the Supreme Court  should be the umpire.  It's neither the pitcher, nor the batter.</p><p>And this is also true regarding the executive branch.  It shouldn't engage  in action outside the scope of the statutory matters that we have enacted  here on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>And so I agree with Judge Kavanaugh and I think at least so far he's done a  fine job before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, one of the top stories in the \"Wall Street Journal\" this  morning, the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh would not say whether a  president could pardon himself or must comply with a subpoena.  Instead,  promising senators to be an independent justice, unswayed by politics.   Your reaction to that?  </p><p>LANCE:  I think that that is the appropriate stance because it might come  before him.  My own opinion, and I am a lawyer, is that presidents cannot  pardon themselves.  But I'm not been nominated to the Supreme Court, and of  course, he wants to view these matters as they may come before him in the  future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Congressman -- there was a lot of hysteria over  the lack of documents that the Democrats wanted to see about Judge  Kavanaugh.  And I find it really ironic that here we have Congress on the  left demanding more documents about Judge Kavanaugh and yet the Congress,  the Intel Committee in particular has been asking the FBI and the DOJ for  documents for a year-and-a-half and they haven't gotten those documents and  we don't see that kind of hysteria there.</p><p>What is your take on what's going on in that investigation?  </p><p>LANCE:  I think you make a very good point and I think that Chairman  Grassley is doing an excellent job and he addressed those questions on the  first day.  And Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have  access to documents.</p><p>And I don't think this is different in substantial regard from what  occurred when Justice Kagan came before the court, she of course, having  been Solicitor-General.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting Brett Kavanaugh to get confirmed?  </p><p>LANCE:  I think that that is highly likely to occur and of course the  Senate may have a full complement, since Senator Kyl is coming back to the  Senate based upon the passing of Senator McCain.  And my best estimate at  the moment is that Judge Kavanaugh will become Justice Kavanaugh.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what do you want to see going into the midterms in terms of  priorities for this president?  </p><p>LANCE:  We want to keep the economy strong.  I favor bipartisanship moving  forward in the new term of Congress.  And in the district I serve, the  question I'm asked most is let's be bipartisan.</p><p>And I'm a member of what's known at the Problem Solvers Caucus here on the  House side of the capitol.  And I think we should work in a bipartisan  capacity moving forward.  And that's what the people of the United States  want -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think you're right.  So how does the Problem Solver  Caucus deal with the delays that we saw at the beginning of the Kavanaugh  hearing?  How does the Problem Solver Caucus deal with Senator Kamala  Harris who wanted to stop the whole thing even before it began?  </p><p>LANCE:  The Problem Solvers Caucus is here on the House side but regarding  my Senate colleagues, my distinguished Senate colleagues, I thought that  Chairman Grassley did a terrific job.  And I don't think that Kamala Harris  should have interrupted Chairman Grassley in literally his first paragraph.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LANCE:  And I think that he is viewed as an incredibly fair chair.  I think  that all would agree with that on Capitol Hill.  And I think that he is  conducting an excellent hearing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think voters will react to what's happening on the  left -- the constant hysteria and resist movement?  Are voters going to  vote against that in November?  </p><p>LANCE:  I think that the American people are in the sensible center, Maria,  and they do not like the partisan bickering back and forth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LANCE:  I think it's much too extreme and we have to be governed in this  country by the sensible center.  I am a moderate conservative.  And I try  to work with those on the moderate liberal side.</p><p>But I don't think that we should move forward in a manner based upon  constantly interrupting each other. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LANCE:  I do not think that is in the best interest of the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much.</p><p>LANCE:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Leonard Lance joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Nike's controversial debut, it happens tonight.  The backlash as  the athletic company gears up to air the first ad featuring Colin  Kaepernick during the NFL season kick-off game tonight.</p><p>Then calling all gamers, details on the new X-Box grease-proof controller,  taking the Internet by storm.  You can have your greasy chicken wings and  still game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>South Korea's special envoy saying that Kim Jong-un's trust in President  Trump remains unchanged.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Mari.</p><p>After visiting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, South Korean officials have  said that Kim emphasized that he has never made a negative comment about  President Trump.  They also say that Kim wants to denuclearize his country  before President Trump's current term ends in early 2021.</p><p>And they set up a summit for September 18th through the 20th -- that's  going to be in Pyongyang between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae- in.  That's going to be their third meeting since April.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump tweeted this morning, \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea  proclaims unwavering faith in President Trump.  Thank you to Chairman Kim.   We will get it done together.\"</p><p>Well, American Express reportedly under investigation by the FBI.  \"The  Wall Street Journal\" says that the FBI is looking into foreign exchange  transactions at the company and whether the international payments  department there misrepresented the pricing to the clients they were trying  to get more business they say.  The newspaper says the inquiry is right now  in the early stages.  Shares of American Express fell more than 1 percent  yesterday. </p><p>Well, crypto currencies getting hammered again today.  Bitcoin has fallen  more than 12 percent in the last 24 hours.  Some are blaming the downturn  on reports that Goldman Sachs has given up on plans to create a crypto  currency trading desk.  But the crypto markets are prone to wild swings and  flash crashes as we know by now.  Bitcoin down about 8 percent at this  hour, it's sitting right now at $6,398 -- $6,400 live on your screen.</p><p>And then there is this, we are soon going to know -- I mean I think we kind  of know what's going to happen to Kevin Spacey's character on \"House of  Cards\" for the sixth and final season.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBIN WRIGHT, ACTRESS:  When they bury me it won't be in my backyard.  And  when they pay their respects they'll have to wait in line.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, yes.  Robin Wright's character, Claire Underwood is standing  over the grave of her husband, Frank Underwood, who was played by Spacey,  of course, in we think the backyard.  Killing off (INAUDIBLE) might not be  as big a surprise for any of you, if you love the show.  Netflix cut ties  with Spacey last November after he was accused of sexual misconduct.</p><p>New season, Maria -- Netflix, November 2nd.  My favorite line from the  finale from last season was Claire said, \"It's my turn.\" </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was her.</p><p>CASONE:  It is.  </p><p>PETE:  That was her final line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  I'm excited about it.  Are you still excited about  it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Robin Wright was the reason that I watched it anyway because  Kevin Spacey increasingly sounded like fog horn leg horn.  That was where  his acting was going.  </p><p>PETE:  And you don't like fog horn.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's like -- it's a caricature of a southerner.  \"I'm  Frank Underwood\".  You make Jeff Sessions sound like he's from south  Boston.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm excited about this.  November 2nd.  Ok, we're going to  watch that.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got this -- breaking news, Vice President Pence's chief of  staff is tweeting out this denial after speculation that Pence may have had  a hand in the anonymous op-ed.  Here's what he's writing.  Jarrod AGen says  \"The Vice President puts his name on his op-eds.  The 'New York Times'  should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical  and gutless op-ed.  Our office is above such amateur acts.\"</p><p>We will take a break.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  More reaction, President Trump is tweeting again  this morning.  He says this right now, \"The deep state and the left and  their vehicle, the fake news media, are going crazy and they don't know  what to do.  The economy is booming like never before.  Jobs are at  historic highs.  Soon two Supreme Court justices and maybe declassification  to find additional corruption.  Wow.\"</p><p>That's my take on it, for sure.  That's why I think this op-ed is coming  out now, because he's having too many successes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the NFL season kicks off tonight amid more controversy.  Jared  Max is here with those details.  Jared -- good morning to you.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS:  Another wow.</p><p>Colin Kaepernick hasn't been a football player since 2016, but he may be  the most talked about figure we will see during tonight's season opener  between the Super Bowl champion Eagles and Atlanta Falcons.</p><p>Yesterday Kaepernick shared a new Nike commercial that will air during  NBC's broadcast tonight.  It's narrated by and features the athlete turned  activist.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  So don't ask if your dreams are  crazy.  Ask if they're crazy enough.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Don't ask if you're crazy; ask if you're crazy enough.  In this two  minute ad, Kaepernick narrates inspirational blurbs about athletes who  overcame unfavorable odds to achieve unprecedented athletic greatness.  And  then he gets tight into the message.</p><p>You remember Nate Boyer -- a veteran Green Beret, served multiple tours in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  A former NFL player convinced Kaepernick two years  ago to kneel instead of sitting.  There's never been a negative connotation  to taking a knee before.</p><p>He took issue with Colin's Nike ad for saying he sacrificed everything.  He  says \"It's dangerous territory to suggest something like that.  For me when  I hear sacrifice everything, the last thing I think about is money.  If  it's a matter of sacrificing money or your brand, that's far different than  sacrificing your life.</p><p>One of the athletes featured in the Nike ad, linebacker Shaquem Griffin,  who had his left hand amputated when he was a young child, a result of  pregnancy complications.  Now, a rook, he will be making his first start,  named a starter for the Seahawks against the Broncos, Sunday.</p><p>Tennis anyone?  Novak Djokovic entered the semifinals at the U.S. Open.   Last night Novak defeated John Millman, the guy who beat Federer in  straight sets.  So he will face K. Nishikori in the semis.</p><p>American Madison Keys also won which means we are on course for a possible  all-American women's final between Keys and Serena Williams.  The women's  semis are today.</p><p>Did you ever see a home run hit 505 feet?  Trevor Story of the (INAUDIBLE)  leading Colorado Rockies last night hit three.  This one traveled further  than any homer since Statcast began to track them three years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Trevor Story, one more than Arenado has 94 now with the  two home runs tonight.  And then Story (INAUDIBLE) -- how about number  three?  Are you kidding me?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Trevor Story -- what a story.  Rockies lead the NOS (ph) by two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stories today -- Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was clapping for Shaqueam Griffin. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX:  Yes, awesome stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He plays with his brother Shaquill Griffin.  And I noted his  performance during the NFL combine and predicted that he would get drafted  by the Seahawks.</p><p>MAX:  He's playing (ph) with a prosthetic hand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the game should be interesting tonight with the new Nike  ad.  In my opinion, the people who are sacrificing everything are the  people who are going to fight for the freedoms of America.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those people who actually decide -- </p><p>PETE:  Hear, hear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to sacrifice things and go fight in Afghanistan, in Iran,  and everywhere else in the Middle East, Iraq.  I mean, it's ridiculous to  say he sacrificed everything.  </p><p>MAX:  I also thing it was ridiculous that he got tied into this ad talking  about athletes.  I don't know where he fits in.  And for my money it seemed  like they completely ripped off a beautiful commercial that was made by  Apple over 20 years ago with the whole \"to the crazy ones campaign\".  I  mean to me I'm like is this plagiarized?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You used the right word, commercial.  This is, as I said earlier  this week, this is a business calculation.  They did the risk-reward  analysis.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" actually wrote a great herd (ph) on  the Street about it, that Nike is worried about losing its cultural  relevancy. </p><p>They don't care about older customers.  They're trying to be progressive  and about new customers and about choosing controversy over obscurity.</p><p>MAX:  I guess they figure they could fool the younger audience.  I don't  know.  I don't know where he's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Colin Kaepernick -- </p><p>PETE:  They're targeting 17 and 19 year-olds or whatever who like  disruption, who like this idea of being very challenging.  My view is, they  could have selected, to your point a vet who has an amputated leg and who  is participating in the various kinds of special Olympics and so forth.</p><p>I mean I think there are so many alternatives that could have fit their  bill -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETE:  -- and not divided their customer base because that's what this is  going to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Colin Kaepernick should join the military.  </p><p>MAX:  He should join something and start to speak.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Adidas overnight gained.  Nike's sales went down three out  of the last four quarters.  That's why they're doing it because we're still  sitting here talking about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Thank you -- Jared Max.</p><p>All right.  Catch Jared's sports reports on FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" or on  Sirius Radio, XM115.</p><p>Coming up, the future of Uber.

The Dow  Industrials up about 20 points today, S&amp;P 500 up a quarter point, but the  NASDAQ is negative going into the open, two hours away.</p><p>After a mixed day on Wall Street yesterday, markets as you can see were  fractionally moving with the Dow up 22, S&amp;P down eight, but the NASDAQ was  the big story as the technology executives testified on Capitol Hill, the  NASDAQ was down better than one percent.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.

In a first time Fox Business interview,  Uber's CEO is speaking out on the path for the ride hailing company to go  public.  Susan Li got the exclusive interview and she's here with the  details, Susan.</p><p>LI:  Good morning to you.  So, 2019 seems to be on track for one of the  largest IPOs in the world.  Uber valued at close to $70 billion.  And of  course, I had to ask Dara Khosrowshahi if he is indeed going public next  year.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI:  People want to know, are you still sticking with your time line of an  IPO in the back half of 2019?  Because your new CFO who will start in a few  days.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Nelson, he's starting next week.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, he says he's not on-board yet though for 2019 listing.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I would expect nothing less of Nelson.  He's independent- minded.  He's rigorous.  And so far he's on the outside.  So I think, I  absolutely want Nelson to come in and I think that when he sees all of the  work that the teams are doing, I think that he will agree that we are ready  for a 2019 IPO.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  There's a bunch of system for that going on, financial work  that's going on.  The company is big enough.  The company is incredibly  important to the world.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  And we have some incredibly talented technologists out  there.  So, I think we're going to be ready but I absolutely want that  stamp of approval from the CFO.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, there's always a but.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  Lyft wants to also IPO in March or April next year.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  So we hear, yes.</p><p>LI:  And the thinking on the street is if they IPO before you, they  basically take up all the IPO capital in the market.  Are you concerned?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I'm not concerned.  Listen, this is Lyft and ourselves are  part of a transportation revolution.  This is about ultimately ending car  ownership.  </p><p>The transportation market is a $6 trillion business.  You may think that  Uber is big but we're $50 billion.  We account for less than one percent of  miles driven and really what ourselves and Lyft are trying to do is to  break apart all the use cases of owning a car.  You own a car to get to  work.  You own a car to pick up the kids at school.  You own a car to get  groceries, etcetera.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  And we're building out services to solve each of those use  cases and ultimately make it -- make it unnecessary for you to own a car.   And we think there are plenty of companies who can be a part of that  revolution.</p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  And I think investors are going to line up behind us and  Lyft.  I certainly hope they are.  </p><p>LI:  So you're guaranteeing a 2019 IPO?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  There's no guarantee.  You don't know what the market is  doing.   LI:  80 percent?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I can guarantee you that we'll be ready and we want to --  and hopefully, the markets will be ready for us.</p><p>LI:  So, you talked about how big Uber is in the ride hailing services.   Some say you own 73 percent of the market.  Given that the U.S. President  has talked about anti-trust situation with the big tech companies like  Google, Amazon, and Facebook.  Do you think that big tech companies like  Uber might be regulated in the future?  Might be broken up?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Well, we're regulated -- listen, we're regulated now, right?  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  We work in every single city etcetera.  We look at the  market as the $6 trillion transportation market.  We're tiny, tiny, tiny  part of the market.  We account for less than one percent of miles driven  on the road.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  So, I think Uber can be ultimately 20, 30 times bigger than  it is today.  </p><p>LI:  So, no fear of being broken up at all?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  No fear of being broken up.  And listen, I think that  ultimately regulators are our partners.  </p><p>LI:  Talking to our audience, you know, there's been a lot of concern about  political bias in Silicon Valley.  You're a giant, your respectable voice  in Silicon Valley.  So, I have to ask you this question.  President Trump  thinks that there's a liberal bias in Silicon Valley with big tech  companies.  Employees and big tech companies have said that they feel that  their conservative voices have been silenced.  Do you think that's true?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I guarantee you that your wait times for your Uber are going  to be equal whether you're Republican or not or Democrat.  I don't think --  listen, I think that bias sees -- if there's a bias, I don't think that it  is a bias on purpose.  </p><p>We as a -- as a company, as a leadership team have been trained on bias as  we're -- as well.  And there's some implicit biases that you may not be  aware of as a person and I think awareness is step one.  So, I don't think  that there's any bias on purpose but if you have a bunch of like-minded  people building product, you may get product that's shaped in one way or  the other.  </p><p>That's why for example, from our standpoint, we want to have more women, we  want to have more under-represented people working as engineers and product  people and have representation at all parts of our company so that the  products that we're building reflect our driver partners and our rider  partners and aren't with any biases that we're not aware of.  </p><p>So, listen, we're human.  All of us are vulnerable.  I think that all of  these companies are trying to do the right thing but they've got some  learning to do and I think the way that they operate going forward has to  change.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great interview.  And we will be showing you more of that  interview of Susan's throughout the day.  And Susan, I thought it was  really interesting that he's talking about this company potentially getting  20 to 30 times bigger.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, you imagine that Uber valued at close to 70 billion.  He was  under selling himself a little bit.  That's a really huge company.  But  there's just so much more potential because we're doing a lot of things,  not just ride hailing.  You know, they're n to flying taxis which he says  will be around in five years, believe it or not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's funny.</p><p>LI:  Yes, autonomous vehicles, they're still spending a lot of money trying  to develop self-driving cars.  And I would say that yes, they're just  thinking of different ways, like scooters and bikes in the future as well.   So it's not just cars.  And he doesn't think you need to own your own car  or your own transportation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's also his personality though, and the fact that people do  love working for this guy.  </p><p>LI:  They love him.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When he talks about women that's very important.  Because under  Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was common knowledge that for women it was a hostile work  environment.  We've learned more detail about exactly what was going on  there in recent years.  Nevertheless, they couldn't hide -- no woman wanted  to go work there.  </p><p>LI:  But there was accusations of misogyny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>LI:  And also sexual harassment claims as well.  But I covered him at  Expedia.  He was Expedia's CEO for 10 years, most loved, most liked, most  respected, charismatic man, and he's brought that to Uber.  Because after  the presentation when he went downstairs after all the interviews, a big  round of applause.  And I -- it's rare --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>LI:  -- in the corporate world.  And he's just a likable guy.  They just  want to rally for him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got new features, an emergency button fro drivers.  </p><p>LI:  That's right.  So, they were here in New York in the Midtown Manhattan  event to launch their new safety features for passengers and riders.  So,  it's something called ride check in the feature.  If you're on a ride, they  will basically use the sensors off your smartphone to detect if you've been  in an accident, if it takes longer than usual.  If you're making extra  stops, just to make sure everyone's OK.  </p><p>They'll also mask your location, your pick-up and drop-off locations and  your phone numbers to make sure no one else has access to that information.   Because as a woman or anyone really riding, you want to be safe at the end  of the day, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, that's number one.  Susa, great interview.  </p><p>LI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for bringing that to us.  Susan Li there.</p><p>Coming up, Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino will join us.  He'll  discuss life off the basketball court.  And why he's done coaching, he  says, that's coming up. </p><p>Then, ranking your college education.  We're revealing the university that  came out on top this year.  You'll want to see this list, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trucks abandoned as a wildfire rages around a  California highway.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  What a scene, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, you thought these fires were over, Maria.  This is the Delta  fire.  It just erupted yesterday afternoon.  It's burned through nearly  eight square miles of timber and brush on both sides of Interstate five.   All of this is just north of Redding, Northern California.  </p><p>Now, according to California Highway Patrol, about 17 semitrailers have  been left behind at this point.  You can see some of that video there.  At  least four of them had caught fire.  The drivers were able to evacuate  safely.  </p><p>Well, CBS reportedly is holding talks with its majority shareholder, Shari  Redstone National Amusements over which company should gain control of the  broadcast network.  Sources are telling the Wall Street Journal that the  talks come less than a month before the dispute has to go to trial.  After  CBS led by Les Moonves sued National Amusements in an attempt to lower its  stake in the company in CBS.  </p><p>Redstone currently controls about 79 percent of CBS.  The stock is down  about 10 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Harvard University taking the top spot in the Wall Street Journal  times higher education college rankings for the second straight year.  The  rankings indicate how well colleges prepare students for life after  graduation.  MIT came in second place after Harvard, followed by Yale,  Columbia and California Institute of technology.  That rounded out the top  five.  </p><p>Running down the list by the way, the top 10, Stanford, Brown and Duke tied  for seventh place.  Followed by Princeton and the University of  Pennsylvania.  </p><p>All right.  Good news for you gamers out there.  Xbox is coming out with a  grease-proof controller.  Now you can eat that bucket of chicken, that  greasy pizza, those chicken wings without worrying about ruining your  device.  Unfortunately, this is only being offered for limited edition in  Australia.  It's part of a marketing campaign for the game PlayerUnknown's  Battleground.  So if you're not in Australia, you can always put order the  official Xbox one wireless controller, that's hitting shelves October 30th.   But we've the grease of chicken on the side.  Shares of Sony, which makes  the Xbox, up 23 percent so far this year, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, good to know that.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, it's important information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You need a dog-proof one too.  Often eaten by dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they step on it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I step on them.  The dog chews on them.  </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I'd like to see the grease accumulator on  some of the ones that have come back.  I mean that's really the interesting  sort of data point, right?  What do they look like?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino is here.   He'll discuss his new book Life Off the basketball court and why he's done  with coaching.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Life off of the court, former Louisville  Cardinals men's basketball coach Rick Pitino is out with a new book.   Documenting his coaching career and the recruiting scandal which shook  college basketball, you may remember.  </p><p>Joining us now is Hall of Fame basketball coach and the author of Pitino,  My Story, Rick Pitino.  Rick, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.  </p><p>RICK PITINO, HALL OF FAME BASKETBALL  COACH, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE:   Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said you recently -- you were done with coaching.   Let's start there, what led to that decision?  </p><p>PITINO:  Well, a lot of thought.  I love coaching.  The passion of it, love  being on the sidelines, just worship March Madness.  I just think that's  about the greatest month in all sports.  But I realized that after the  Southern District of New York put my name in a complaint and involved me  with something I was totally foreign to, it would be unfair for any college  to hire me.  Because you start out at a press conference, the colleges all  excited to have you, the student bodies all excited and then they bring up  two scandals.  So, I think it's best to close the book on that and to get  on with something else that's stimulating in my life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you walk us through how that felt for you?  Tell us about  the scandal and what happened.  </p><p>PITINO:  Well, all of a sudden my two assistant coaches are picked up by  the FBI and then they come and visit me and said do you want an attorney  present.  I said, for what?  They explained to me what happened.  And  basically, this has been going on since 2014.  They -- somebody was  indicted.  A scam artist, of which some very, very serious things that have  happened to him.  He was a scam artist and he said I can deliver college  basketball coaches to you who are doing it the wrong way.  And like they  all do, he turned in some people.  And then four years later after a lot of  FISA warrants would a lot of investigative work by the FBI, and the  talented men of the FBI.  I don't think they should be dealing with college  basketball assistants.</p><p>They've come away after four years with indicting four assistant coaches.   A couple Adidas representatives, an AAU coach that took money but they  exonerated him because he kept the money, he didn't give it to a prospect.</p><p>And meanwhile, my life has been shaken.  And I'm out of -- I'm out of my  passion.  But the worst part about the whole thing, because I sent my  lawyers in to visit with them and tell them that I've never cheated in a  game of college basketball.  I've never cheated the game itself.  I've just  given a lot to the game, I believe.  </p><p>And their response was interesting, it's look, you damaged this man's life,  his credibility, worked 40 years in the game.  And their response very  callously was we deal with collateral damage all the time.  </p><p>So, I'm waiting for the phone call from them, apologizing.  And everybody  says you're going to wait until you die because it's not happening.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Coach, there's been a lot of talk about potentially paying  college athletes not just basketball players, would that alleviate some of  the noise that's in the system?  </p><p>PITINO:  You know it's -- the problem is, I believe in paying the athletes,  letting them -- by paying -- if I'm a great athlete, I want to do a  commercial, I have the right to do a commercial.  The problem with that is  then cheating comes into that area.  OK, if I'm school X and I want to do a  car commercial.  We'll give you $60,000 instead of the other school giving  you $20,000.  </p><p>So, it's a difficult way to navigate through what to do, what not to do.  I  believe one thing, though.  If parents want to go see their child play and  you're making millions of dollars off that young man's athleticism, they  should be able to have their flights and hotel paid for to go see that  young man play, especially during March Madness in the tournament.  Every  game those parents should be able to be put up in a hotel and if flights  should be paid for.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you said it was unfair to colleges if they took you on as  a coach because of -- it would expose them to the allegations.  But has  anybody really approached you?  Have you -- did you get phone calls from  other colleges or even professional teams?  </p><p>PITINO:  I had two job offers last year.  We talked.  We sat down.  One  president came in and was nice enough to visit with me.  And then there was  another school, I was interested in -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you want to tell us which schools?  </p><p>PITINO:  I'd rather not.  But the other school I was -- I was interested  in.  They called the NCAA and said, can you give us clearance on Rick  Pitino, he did nothing wrong.  Their response to us, we can't investigate  anything until the Southern District of New York is done with their -- with  whatever they're doing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what, do you have a time line in terms of when they're done?   Are they done at this point?  </p><p>PITINO:  I don't know.  I know there's some things are going to trial yet  in September.  Nobody from Louisville, not myself.  I'm not involved in any  way.  And I have no fears about any of that because I know what I've done  with college basketball and I know what I believe in my beliefs in doing it  the right way and we do it like most coaches.  </p><p>By the way, I believe that less than 10 percent of college basketball is  corrupt.  I think 90 percent of college basketball, people do it the right  way, their hearts are with the student athletes.  They want to help those  young men prosper in life.  </p><p>But like any industry, whether it's Wall Street, whether it's the medical  professional, less than 10 percent does it the wrong way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PITINO:  And that's what needs to be cleaned up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure, we're going to be watching that Rick.  Thanks so much for  joining us, telling us your story.  </p><p>PITINO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you coach.</p><p>PITINO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rick Pitino there.  </p><p>Still ahead, a major shift for Burberry, the changes headed to the luxury  goods maker.  Next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is Thursday  September 6th.

A bear market is difficult to navigate at the best of times, let alone during a global pandemic. At times of uncertainty, it can be easy for investors to get caught up in a herd mentality, following others for direction and reassurance. Surely, if the share price is on its way up at a time like this, you're onto a winner? But herein lies the danger of the bandwagon. You could be joining a run that has already taken place or extending a stretched valuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we look out across the wasteland, certain companies are standing tall or getting even taller - seeming winners from the trends and changes in behaviour that Covid-19 has brought about. It's hard to ignore the excitement, from the prospect of the next generation of antiviral therapies to the technology that will underpin our increasingly digitalised lives. But before being overrun by the hype, it's worth stepping back, unpacking these hot stocks and asking: are they really smart investments?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     The race for a cure                   </p><p>Investing in pharmaceuticals often feels akin to gambling, betting on what will be the next blockbuster drug. To give a sense of the odds, a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) estimates just 14 per cent of drugs developed achieve regulatory approval. Treatments take years to progress from research and development to commercial availability. As we look to conquer the novel coronavirus, that process is being condensed into just months. The urgency stems from the fact that an effective therapy could see restrictions on movement eased, while a vaccine could allow us to resume our normal lives.</p><p>Think tank the Milken Institute is tracking 199 treatments in consideration and 123 vaccines in development. But one drug, in particular, has captured the investment community's attention - Gilead Sciences' (US:GILD) remdesivir. Previously tested as an Ebola treatment, it seeks to disrupt a virus's replication process. Enjoying a first-mover advantage, it is further down the pipeline as a Covid-19 therapy than rival drugs, already being evaluated in multiple late-stage clinical studies.</p><p>But the frenzy has seen it become the tail that wags the US stock market. Its share price tracked largely sideways across 2019, but is up almost a quarter so far this year. Volatility over the past month demonstrates how investors are putting too much stock in complex medical data they do not fully understand - everybody is an armchair epidemiologist these days. For example, a summary of a Chinese trial accidentally published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) sent Gilead and the S&amp;P 500 tumbling after revealing remdesivir had no \"statistically significant clinical benefits\" for Covid-19 patients. Had those eager bears awaited full publication in The Lancet, they would have seen only 237 out of a desired 453 patients were recruited as the outbreak came under control in China, making the result less conclusive.</p><p>While remdesivir has been granted 'emergency use authorisation' (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we would still advise caution. President Trump's favoured chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - before he got side-tracked by disinfectant and ultraviolet light - have also been awarded EUA despite thinner clinical evidence. Meanwhile, analysts have questioned how Gilead will monetise remdesivir having spent $50m on research and development in the first quarter. RBC Capital Markets believes it will likely be provided at cost during the pandemic with profit coming from future stockpiling. This could be scuppered by an alternative treatment or vaccine.</p><p>Rather than falling victim to the breathless Gilead news cycle, we think investors should look at more diversified pharma investments exposed to the fight against coronavirus. This includes AstraZeneca (AZN) as well as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK has teamed up with French giant Sanofi (FRA:SAN) to develop a Covid-19 vaccine using its 'adjuvant' technology. Aside from this, GSK is investing heavily in research and development to bolster its pipeline, focusing on oncology treatments. </p><p>                     A cleaner world?                   </p><p>As we dedicate more of our lives standing over the sink and washing our hands, soap has never been more popular. The increased focus on personal and home hygiene has seen soaring demand for cleaning products from consumer goods specialists such as Reckitt Benckiser (RB.). Intuitively, it makes sense to think this company would do well out of this crisis - people need disinfectant, and at times of crisis they turn to trusted brands such as Harpic and Dettol. The bullish outlook on Reckitt's pandemic prospects has seen its share price recover all losses from the wider market sell-off in March.</p><p>Recent figures would seem to support this confidence. Reckitt saw a 13 per cent increase in like-for-like hygiene sales to \u00a31.36bn in the first quarter of this year. With Lysol sales up over 50 per cent, North American hygiene revenue rose by a fifth. Strong demand for Dettol across developed and emerging markets boosted 'other' health sales by 17 per cent to \u00a3825m. In contrast to companies issuing profit warnings and scrapping their guidance, the group now anticipates a full-year performance ahead of previous expectations, although this will be tempered by higher operating costs. </p><p>Clearly, Reckitt is benefiting in the here and now. The question is whether this will last. The group concedes that \"the split between defensive buying and higher levels of underlying consumption is unclear\". On balance, we are likely to see more permanent changes in consumer behaviour as people (hopefully) remain more hygiene conscious moving forward. But once lockdown measures and supply chain pressures ease, consumers will once again have full access to cheaper private label substitutes that were challenging premium brands pre-pandemic - coronavirus may have granted a temporary reprieve amid panic buying and stockpiling. With this in mind, part of Reckitt's three-year transformation strategy is to invest in increasing its competitiveness. As it continues to recover from the body blow of the Mead Johnson infant formula acquisition, we think the herd is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/04/16/reckitt-s-rejuvenated-bull-case/\">moving in the right direction</url> with this one.</p><p>Investors looking to clean up might also consider infection prevention specialist <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/04/16/reckitt-s-rejuvenated-bull-case/\">Tristel</url>(TSTL). Seeing a mere seven-day blip in mid-March, the shares have continued their ascent. While its chlorine dioxide products are in high demand from hospitals right now, it is more than just an opportunistic play. There were already long-term growth drivers pre-pandemic, including rising anti-microbial resistance, regulatory tailwinds and plans for US expansion. </p><p>                     Technology's unstoppable rise                   </p><p>The technology revolution has been accelerated by Covid-19. Microsoft (US:MSFT) chief executive Satya Nadella recently remarked: \"We have seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months.\" But it is not just 'Big Tech' reaping the benefits. Zoom Video Communications (US:ZM) has emerged as a standout player enabling businesses to stay connected during the mass work from home experiment. It has also morphed into a social network as everyday consumers use the platform for everything from family catch-ups to weddings.</p><p>With the number of daily meeting participants soaring from 10m in December to over 300m in April, the 'Zoom boom' hasn't gone unnoticed - its shares have more than doubled since the beginning of the year, reaching $143. That meteoric rise brings temptation to buy in for fear of missing out. Some investors were left red-faced after piling onto the wrong Zoom. Shares in Chinese telecommunications company Zoom Technologies (ZOOM) rocketed up from around $3 to $21 in March. The US securities and exchange commission (SEC) temporarily paused trading of that Zoom amid the confusion.</p><p>Beyond this comical error, investors in the actual Zoom have also been caught out. The newfound fame has brought increased scrutiny, unveiling a string of security and privacy concerns, from sending users' data to Facebook (US:FB) - something that has triggered a class action lawsuit in California - to account details being distributed by hackers. A report by technology and security research group Citizen Lab concluded the platform might be appropriate for social use but is \"not suited for secrets\". The biggest controversy is perhaps 'Zoombombing', whereby uninvited people gate-crash meetings and insert graphic, inappropriate content.</p><p>Having unveiled a new security update, Zoom contends its missteps are the growing pains of an application designed for enterprise use rather than socialising - 80 per cent of its revenue comes from business customers. Chief executive Eric Yuan says the broader usership is \"presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived\". That excuse isn't flying with some. Google and SpaceX, among others, have prohibited employees from using the app and there is mounting pressure from US lawmakers for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation.</p><p>Zoom's financial performance is less controversial. Unlike some other tech unicorns that have floated, it is profitable. It registered a pre-tax profit of $26.4m in the 12 months to 31 January, up from $8.3m a year earlier, on the back of an 88 per cent increase in revenue to $623m. It also generated $114m of free cash flow.</p><p>Analysts are split on how the pandemic will play out. RBC believes Zoom can become the \"de facto global communication platform\", estimating Covid-19 could add $160m of revenue this year and $257m next year. But Credit Suisse expects the recent surge will prove \"ephemeral\" and free users will be difficult to monetise. With the free tier allowing group chats for up to 100 participants for under 40 minutes, there is little incentive to pay a subscription. Facebook's new Messenger Rooms could spoil the party, allowing meetings of up to 50 people, including those without an account, with no time limit.</p><p>On the enterprise front, Microsoft Teams is the most significant competitive threat. With over 200m commercial users of Office 365, this provide a natural platform to promote Teams, which has surpassed 75m daily active users, up from 20m at the end of last year. Zoom is more of a one-trick pony, while Microsoft is a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/04/16/reckitt-s-rejuvenated-bull-case/\">better overall bet</url> with its arsenal of technology, including cloud computing infrastructure. </p><p>Zoom's shares were expensive pre-pandemic and an enterprise value of 31 times forecast 2021 revenue is far greater than software peers with multiples in the mid-teens. Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, believes Zoom is \"priced to mania\". Perhaps sensing a bubble, short sellers have renewed their charge.</p><p>Intuitively, there is a long-term investment case if the shift towards remote working sticks. Zoom has proved popular because it is easy to use, reliable and fun. But further skeletons could see the boom give way to a backlash. This is one bandwagon we're happy to let roll by.</p><p>                     Thriving in chaos                   </p><p>The market volatility caused by Covid-19 has seen a surge in trading activity - good news for online platforms IG (IGG), Plus500 (PLUS) and CMC Markets (CMCX), which had been weighed down by European Union (EU) regulation to reduce the risk of big losses for retail investors. </p><p>Making money through commissions and spreads on its leveraged products, IG's revenue in just the first 36 days of its current quarter is estimated to be \u00a3173m, more than the \u00a3140m posted in the entire preceding quarter. With the 'Corona crunch' plastered across the news, and casinos and sporting activity pared back, more people are taking a gamble on the stock market. IG added 22,500 over-the-counter clients during those 36 days, compared with 36,000 in the first three quarters of the year combined.</p><p>Plus500 saw sales in the first quarter of 2020 surge almost fivefold year on year to $317m (\u00a3254m), with the number of active customers nearly doubling. Full-year earnings are now guided to be \"substantially ahead\" of consensus expectations. The improved outlook has seen short interest fall from over 12 per cent of the issued share capital at the beginning of the year to less than 1 per cent.</p><p>But there's no such thing as a free lunch. IG's boost will be offset by higher operating costs, partially due to higher provisions for bad and doubtful debts. There's also a question of whether the 'good times' will last. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index - a measure of future expectations of volatility - is now tracking downwards and retail investors are more likely to retreat amid fatigue and mounting losses. Meanwhile, platforms face the prospect of Australian regulators emulating their European counterparts.</p><p>While Berkshire Hathaway's (US:BRK.A) recent $50bn net loss may have taken some shine off of the 'Sage of Omaha', we're still inclined to favour Warren Buffett's philosophy: \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy only when others are fearful\". The immediate opportunities of the pandemic have likely now passed. Unless you have a high appetite for risk and short time horizon, it is best to consider quality companies doing well in this crisis, but also underpinned by a long-term growth story.

A bear market is difficult to navigate at the best of times, let alone during a global pandemic. At times of uncertainty, it can be easy for investors to get caught up in a herd mentality, following others for direction and reassurance. Surely, if the share price is on its way up at a time like this, you're onto a winner? But herein lies the danger of the bandwagon. You could be joining a run that has already taken place or extending a stretched valuation.</p><p>As we look out across the wasteland, certain companies are standing tall or getting even taller - seeming winners from the trends and changes in behaviour that Covid-19 has brought about. It's hard to ignore the excitement, from the prospect of the next generation of antiviral therapies to the technology that will underpin our increasingly digitalised lives. But before being overrun by the hype, it's worth stepping back, unpacking these hot stocks and asking: are they really smart investments? The race for a cure Investing in pharmaceuticals often feels akin to gambling, betting on what will be the next blockbuster drug. To give a sense of the odds, a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) estimates that just 14 per cent of drugs developed achieve regulatory approval. Treatments take years to progress from research and development to commercial availability. As we look to conquer the novel coronavirus, that process is being condensed into just months. The urgency stems from the fact that an effective therapy could see restrictions on movement eased, while a vaccine could allow us to resume our normal lives.</p><p>Think tank the Milken Institute is tracking 199 treatments in consideration and 123 vaccines in development. But one drug, in particular, has captured the investment community's attention - Gilead Sciences' (US:GILD) remdesivir. Previously tested as an Ebola treatment, it seeks to disrupt a virus's replication process. Enjoying a first-mover advantage, it is further down the pipeline as a Covid-19 therapy than rival drugs, already being evaluated in multiple late-stage clinical studies.</p><p>But the frenzy has seen it become the tail that wags the US stock market. Its share price tracked largely sideways across 2019, but is up almost a quarter so far this year. Volatility over the past month demonstrates how investors are putting too much stock in complex medical data they do not fully understand - everybody is an armchair epidemiologist these days. For example, a summary of a Chinese trial accidentally published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) sent Gilead and the S&amp;P 500 tumbling after revealing remdesivir had no \"statistically significant clinical benefits\" for Covid-19 patients. Had those eager bears awaited full publication in The Lancet, they would have seen only 237 out of a desired 453 patients were recruited as the outbreak came under control in China, making the result less conclusive.</p><p>While remdesivir has been granted 'emergency use authorisation' (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we would still advise caution. President Trump's favoured chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - before he got side-tracked by disinfectant and ultraviolet light - have also been awarded EUA despite thinner clinical evidence. Meanwhile, analysts have questioned how Gilead will monetise remdesivir having spent $50m on research and development in the first quarter. RBC Capital Markets believes it is likely to be provided at cost during the pandemic, with profit coming from future stockpiling. This could be scuppered by an alternative treatment or vaccine. Rather than falling victim to the breathless Gilead news cycle, we think investors should look at more diversified pharma investments exposed to the fight against coronavirus. This includes AstraZeneca (AZN) (see our tip on page 43), as well as GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK). GSK has teamed up with French giant Sanofi (FRA:SAN) to develop a Covid-19 vaccine using its 'adjuvant' technology. Aside from this, GSK is investing heavily in research and development to bolster its pipeline, focusing on oncology treatments.</p><p>Technology's unstoppable rise The technology revolution has been accelerated by Covid-19. Microsoft (US:MSFT) chief executive Satya Nadella recently remarked: \"We have seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months.\" But it is not just 'Big Tech' reaping the benefits. Zoom Video Communications (US:ZM) has emerged as a standout player, enabling businesses to stay connected during the mass working from home experiment. It has also morphed into a social network as everyday consumers use the platform for everything from family catch-ups to weddings.</p><p>With the number of daily meeting participants soaring from 10m in December to more than 300m in April, the 'Zoom boom' hasn't gone unnoticed - its shares have more than doubled since the beginning of the year, reaching $143. That meteoric rise brings temptation to buy in for fear of missing out. Some investors were left red-faced after piling into the wrong Zoom. Shares in Chinese telecommunications company Zoom Technologies (ZOOM) rocketed up from around $3 to $21 in March. The US securities and exchange commission (SEC) temporarily paused trading of that Zoom amid the confusion.</p><p>Beyond this comical error, investors in the actual Zoom have also been caught out. The newfound fame has brought increased scrutiny, unveiling a string of security and privacy concerns, from sending users' data to Facebook (US:FB) - something that has triggered a class action lawsuit in California - to account details being distributed by hackers. A report by technology and security research group Citizen Lab concluded the platform might be appropriate for social use, but is \"not suited for secrets\". The biggest controversy is perhaps 'Zoombombing', whereby uninvited people gate-crash meetings and insert graphic, inappropriate content.</p><p>Having unveiled a new security update, Zoom contends its missteps are the growing pains of an application designed for enterprise use rather than socialising - 80 per cent of its revenue comes from business customers. Chief executive Eric Yuan says the broader usership is \"presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived\". That excuse isn't flying with some. Google and SpaceX, among others, have prohibited employees from using the app and there is mounting pressure from US lawmakers for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation.</p><p>Zoom's financial performance is less controversial.</p><p>Unlike some other tech unicorns that have floated, it is profitable. It registered a pre-tax profit of $26.4m in the 12 months to 31 January, up from $8.3m a year earlier, on the back of an 88 per cent increase in revenue to $623m. It also generated $114m of free cash flow.</p><p>Analysts are split on how the pandemic will play out. RBC believes Zoom can become the \"de facto global communication platform\", estimating Covid-19 could add $160m of revenue this year and $257m next year. But Credit Suisse expects that the recent surge will prove \"ephemeral\" and that free users will be difficult to monetise. With the free tier allowing group chats for up to 100 participants for under 40 minutes, there is little incentive to pay a subscription. Facebook's new Messenger Rooms could spoil the party, allowing meetings of up to 50 people, including those without an account, with no time limit.</p><p>On the enterprise front, Microsoft Teams is the most significant competitive threat. With more than 200m commercial users of Office 365, this provides a natural platform to promote Teams, which has surpassed 75m daily active users, up from 20m at the end of last year. Zoom is more of a one-trick pony, while Microsoft is a better overall bet, with its arsenal of technology, including cloud computing infrastructure.</p><p>Zoom's shares were expensive pre-pandemic and an enterprise value of 31 times forecast 2021 revenue is far greater than software peers with multiples in the midteens. Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, believes Zoom is \"priced to mania\". Perhaps sensing a bubble, short sellers have renewed their charge.</p><p>Intuitively, there is a long-term investment case if the shift towards remote working sticks. Zoom has proved popular because it is easy to use, reliable and fun. But further skeletons could see the boom give way to a backlash. This is one bandwagon we're happy to let roll by.</p><p>While Berkshire Hathaway's (US:BRK.A) recent $50bn net loss may have taken some shine off the 'Sage of Omaha', we're still inclined to favour Warren Buffett's philosophy: \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy only when others are fearful.\" The immediate opportunities of the pandemic have probably now passed. Unless you have a high appetite for risk and short time horizon, it is best to consider quality companies doing well in this crisis, but also underpinned by a long-term growth story. The hot stock du jour may be calling out to you, but don't be afraid to take the advice of a famous Disney character and \"let it go\".</p><p>Thriving in chaos The market volatility caused by Covid-19 has seen a surge in trading activity - good news for online platforms IG (IGG), Plus500 (PLUS) and CMC Markets (CMCX), which had been weighed down by European Union (EU) regulation to reduce the risk of big losses for retail investors.</p><p>Making money through commissions and spreads on its leveraged products, IG's revenue in just the first 36 days of its current quarter is estimated to be \u00a3173m, more than the \u00a3140m posted in the entire preceding quarter. With the 'Corona crunch' plastered across the news, and casinos and sporting activity pared back, more people are taking a gamble on the stock market. IG added 22,500 overthe-counter clients during those 36 days, compared with 36,000 in the first three quarters of the year combined.</p><p>Plus500 saw sales in the first quarter of 2020 surge almost fivefold year on year to $317m (\u00a3254m), with the number of active customers nearly doubling. Full-year earnings are now guided to be \"substantially ahead\" of consensus expectations. The improved outlook has seen short interest fall from over 12 per cent of the issued share capital at the beginning of the year to less than 1 per cent.</p><p>But there's no such thing as a free lunch. IG's boost will be offset by higher operating costs, partially due to higher provisions for bad and doubtful debts. There's also a question of whether the 'good times' will last. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index - a measure of future expectations of volatility - is now tracking downwards and retail investors are more likely to retreat amid fatigue and mounting losses.

However, they've also been responsible, in many ways, for some of the most pressing issues we face today. For example, concerns that TikTok exposes children to predatory behaviour led to the app being taken off the stores of Google and Apple; although this has since been reversed. YouTube has faced similar issues in the past. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are being used to bully and harass, especially those from socially marginalised communities and to magnify extremist content and propaganda. </p><p>There are multiple instances where Facebook has been involved in leaking user information, harvesting user data, using targetted advertising to influence election results and pushing political propaganda. It has, along with Whatsapp, also been used to propage \"fake news\" and spreading disinformation and misinformation, which has been linked to violence and deaths in India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Uber, Amazon and Apple have all been criticised for their lax labour standards. And Google, Facebook and Amazon have been accused of (and sometimes held liable for) anti-competitive behaviour. More generally, there is also a lack of transparency in the way these companies function and most of them have access to vast amounts of user data, which is collected, stored and sold to advertisers with minimal oversight.</p><p>Many of these issues exist and are exacerbated because some of these technology companies, especially \"Big Tech\" firms (generally refers to Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple), have large businesses and because of their significant global market share and revenue. A major reason as to why these companies were able to rapidly scale to their current sizes lies in their leveraging what is known as the \"network effect\", wherein the value of certain goods or services increases as they gain more users. These platforms have also been able to invest in improving their services, especially by collecting and leveraging large pools of user data to improve their machine-learning algorithms.</p><p>While utilising network effects is not problematic by itself, the vast wealth of these firms has also meant that they could often simply buy out and integrate the products or services of competitors, or prioritise their own platforms over others and, hence, entrench their dominant positions. Furthermore, until recently, they faced virtually no regulatory oversight and were given free rein with how they chose to conduct businesses. This was, in large part, a consequence of the public support that these companies enjoyed and because they, and technology more generally, were seen as offering a way to enable access to information - providing \"free\" services or helping consumers obtain goods and services at lower costs. However, issues that have arisen have made it clear that there is no longer a question of whether to regulate technology companies but rather one of how best to do so.</p><p>Regulators around the world are grappling with this problem in multiple ways. The European Union (EU) introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to regulate the use of personal data of those in the body. Germany introduced a law requiring platforms to remove hate speech and other illegal content within 24 hours of being informed of such material. Singapore introduced a Bill that seeks to impose penalties on users and platforms for spreading \"false statements of fact\" in the country. Furthermore, Australia passed a Bill that forces technology companies to hand over encrypted data to the police. More recently, the lower House of the Russian Parliament went so far as to vote to support a Bill that would essentially allow it to create its own domestic internet, ostensibly for national security reasons.</p><p>Some of these measures can have unintended consequences. For instance, the GDPR has been criticised for its broad definitions and because its stringent data protection requirements are more likely to disproportionately affect smaller companies by driving up costs, potentially stifling competition. Similarly, in India, there are concerns that regulations, often aimed at fixing issues caused by larger platforms, could significantly impair the ability of start-ups to scale their businesses. Moreover, some of the more extreme measures that have been introduced (such as those requiring building in backdoors to encryption and restricting the Internet to national boundaries) have the potential to alter the nature of the Internet itself and have wide-ranging implications for civil liberties, security and rights such as privacy.</p><p>India is also in the process of framing regulations applicable to this space. Over the course of the last year, the Government published the draft Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules] 2018, the draft Personal Data Protection Bill and the draft National e-Commerce Policy. While each of these regulations was ostensibly introduced to solve specific issues and sought to regulate distinct areas of the digital economy, they also had overlaps, which affected each other. For instance, the Intermediary Rules primarily sought to address misinformation and \"fake news\" on social media platforms by requiring intermediaries to take certain steps, such as proactively monitoring their platforms for unlawful content. However, the definition of \"intermediaries\" is broad enough to encompass practically all entities from social media sites, messaging platforms, e-commerce platforms, cyber cafes, payment companies and internet service providers, thereby making these rules applicable to these entities as well. The draft e-Commerce Policy, in addition to introducing data localisation and other requirements, also seems to be conceptualising a State-controlled, community-owned-model for data, referring to it as a \"collective resource\" and a \"national asset.\" This has implications for entities beyond e-commerce companies and can impact how the right to privacy is developed in India. It also potentially runs counter to the Supreme Court's decision in Puttaswamy vs Union of India, where privacy, framed primarily as an individual right, was held to be a fundamental right.</p><p>Technology companies can vary widely in the function and services they provide, even though they all share the attribute of providing goods and services through the internet. Therefore, in order to avoid unintended consequences and over-broad application, regulations must be narrowly crafted to address specific identified issues. Regulations must be framed in a manner that they are differentiated on certain metrics (such as the function served by the platforms, the potential impact on users and businesses and the aim sought to be achieved by regulation). One possible method for crafting regulation on this basis is by having more stringent requirements apply to companies that are of a certain size and scale and cross certain prescribed thresholds (whether measured in revenue, user or subscription base, or a combination of such other metrics). Another is by regulating intermediaries based on the function they undertake or the service they provide. However, given how digital companies integrate multiple services such as payments, chat, networking and the like onto the same platforms, this could also be challenging, and would require extensive collaboration with other regulators.</p><p>Another key component to consider in this context is the companies that are being currently regulated. It is especially important to include dialogue with technology companies in the context of the digital economy, given that platforms are best placed to understand the limits and abilities of the technologies they deploy. This is also why it might be useful, instead of just seeing regulations as a way to impose liability on companies, to also see them as a means of increasing platform accountability. A regulatory model that takes into account dialogue with these companies, and is based on principles of platform accountability, transparency, and ensuring effective redressal mechanisms may be a more effective way to address some of the challenges presented by digital platforms, than the sort of blanket regulations that are the norm today.</p><p>(The writer is junior fellow at the Esya Centre)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Amazon and PayPal executives even had meetings with the OCC over the past year, though whether they discussed the charter was unclear.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lost in all this was an inescapable fact: Big tech firms like Amazon don't need a charter to disrupt the banking industry. Indeed, they are already changing it.</p><p>\"This is a classic missing the forest for the trees, looking at the charters,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. \"Who needs a charter? They can offer the structural equivalent without one.\"</p><p>Amazon has done more than $1 billion in small-business lending since it first started offering loans. In 2017, it launched Amazon Cash, which effectively allows it to take cash deposits from customers via ubiquitous convenience stores like 7-Eleven and Sheetz. Other tech firms, including Apple and Samsung, offer their own payment apps.</p><p>It's not clear what tech giants have in store next, but they will likely push the limits of traditional finance. It's not hard to imagine the Bank of Alexa, enabling customers to move money and pay bills just by shouting at the Amazon Echo in their living rooms.</p><p>The barbarians aren't at the gate anymore. They're inside the walls.</p><p>Some see a massive break looming in the banking business.</p><p>In a report issued in late 2017, McKinsey &amp; Co.predicted a split between \"manufacturers\" of banking, the core business of financing and lending that is hard for tech firms to replace, versus \"distributors,\" the origination and sales side of the business where outside competitors have an easier time entering the system.</p><p>If banks effectively end up as utilities to larger tech firms, they will lose out. McKinsey forecasts manufacturing will produce only 35% of profits in finance, a return on equity of 4.4%. Distribution, meanwhile, will produce 65% of profits, with a return on equity of 20%.</p><p>\"As platform companies extend their tentacles into banking, it is the rich returns of the distribution business they are targeting,\" McKinsey concluded. \"And in many cases, they are better positioned for distribution than banks are.\"</p><p>Most experts agree that banks still have three key advantages: the sheer ability to manufacture finance, which isn't easy for tech competitors; a mound of data on customers' financial activities; and customer trust.</p><p>\"When it comes to customers' decisions about where to place their money, research shows that banks enjoy greater trust than tech companies,\" the McKinsey report said.</p><p>But tech companies are putting pressure on banks in all three areas. A recent survey by Bain &amp; Co. put Amazon and PayPal nearly as high as banks in levels of customer trust.</p><p>Remember that theoretical Bank of Alexa? More than 25% of U.S. respondents in the Bain survey said they would consider using \"voice-controlled assistants for their everyday banking.\" And Amazon dominates that market. On Cyber Monday 2017 - the largest single shopping day in the company's history - the biggest-selling item was the Echo Dot, its entry-level Alexa speaker. That's a lot of voice-controlled assistants already sitting in bank customers' homes.</p><p>Amazon, Googleand Facebook are sitting on their own pile of data that includes everything from what customers already own to what they secretly covet (via searches online). There's no doubt that tech companies are eager to find ways to exploit that information in the financial services arena.</p><p>Some analysts argue that banks have squandered their data advantage.</p><p>\"Who owns the customer?\" asked Petrou. \"Who owns the data? Banks assume they do. They haven't capitalized on it.\"</p><p>So what can banks do in the shadow of Amazon and others' moves into their business?</p><p>For one, they can stop focusing on distracting fights about bank charters. Federal regulators are unlikely to grant one to a Silicon Valley firm in any case - and those firms don't need one to take away business from banks.</p><p>More important, banks must stay in the forefront of customers' minds. In consumer trust, they are still winning. And while that advantage is eroding, it's not gone yet. And for tougher credits, it may never fade.</p><p>\"Small banks succeed because they are in their communities dealing with the tough credit issues that nobody else wants to solve,\" said Howard Headlee, the head of the Utah Bankers Association. \"Amazon and Googlearen't going to do that.\"</p><p>Banks also need to continue innovating. Customers want to go to tech firms only if they are offering something they can't get at their own bank.</p><p>Even McKinsey said banks are making strides there. Both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo recently launched mobile-only banking apps with an emphasis on making it easier for customers to interact.</p><p>Through strategic partnerships and a focus on customer service, banks may not be out of the running yet - with or without Amazon or Googletrying to enter the business.</p><p>\"It is not too far-fetched to imagine a day when banks will offer a range of services, reach a vastly larger customer base, and succeed at their digital rivals' game,\" McKinsey said in the report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USBANK-223514-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USBANK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R9W-RY01-F06X-W3CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8066</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

A powerful one. He eyed a WASR-10, the Romanian version of the Russian AK-47. It would do the job.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Legan lived in California, which bans such military-style rifles. So he drove to Nevada, which doesn't. On July 9, in the town of Fallon, he bought the weapon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nine days later, Legan used it to shoot up the Garlic Festival in Gilroy, Calif, where he had graduated from high school. The weapon's lethality allowed Legan to kill three people and wound 15 others in less than a minute, before police officers neutralized him and he shot himself.</p><p>Gilroy thus joined Parkland and so many other American cities as the scene of mass shootings. Gilroy's story, however, especially shows why the response to this plague must come from Washington. For every state and city that gets tough on gun violence, others will enable it.</p><p>After the slaughter in El Paso and Dayton came the predictable comment from gun control opponents that new laws wouldn't work. As evidence, they regularly cite Chicago, which has very restrictive firearms regulations. They inspired one of the two seminal Supreme Court rulings on the Second Amendment.</p><p>Following the 2017 killing of 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., President Trump said, \"If you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, it's Chicago. And Chicago is a disaster. It's a total disaster.\"</p><p>Indeed, as the shooters in El Paso and Dayton carried out their attacks, someone shot up a park in Chicago. Seven people were wounded. It's been another violent summer.</p><p>Not long before Trump's comments, however, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office released a study showing that most of the guns used in crimes came from outside Chicago. Of all the guns police had confiscated, just 40 percent had been bought in Illinois. A chunk of those had come from gun shops just outside the city limits.</p><p>Roughly 20 percent of all the confiscated weapons were from Indiana. Chicago borders the state. The Giffords Law Center, which advocates for tougher restrictions, gave Indiana a grade of D-minus for its combination of lax gun laws and rate of gun deaths. Illinois got a B-plus.</p><p>The New York attorney general's office conducted a similar study. It showed that three-fourths of all seized firearms came from outside the state.</p><p>New York City is close to a pair of states with strong laws, New Jersey and Connecticut. The study noted, however, that roughly half of those out-of-state firearms came from six states with much weaker laws: Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia - and Florida.</p><p>The weapons go north on Interstate 95 in what the study called the Iron Pipeline. \"Our analysis of the data,\" the researchers wrote, \"shows these states deserve their anecdotal nickname.\" The study also noted that guns from Ohio - which has a D rating from the Giffords Center - is an \"important but overlooked source of crime guns\" to upstate New York via Interstate 90.</p><p>So only Congress can provide a nationwide, and thus effective response to gun violence. That will require almost every Republican and some Democrats to break with the National Rifle Association and the firearms industry's usual attempts to deflect blame from easy access to military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p><p>Example: U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Republican from North Central Florida, told CNN, \"Big Tech has a big responsibility in this,\" by looking into people \"that are posting manifestos out there.\"</p><p>In fact, the El Paso shooter posted his white supremacist manifesto just 19 minutes before opening fire. His manifesto killed no one. His military-style rifle killed 22.</p><p>Similarly, Trump promised to root out violent postings on social media. But his administration didn't sign a resolution toward that goal after the March slaying of 51 Muslims in New Zealand. When Trump hosted a social media summit last month, the topic was supposedly about anti-conservative bias, not violence.</p><p>Combine easy access to firearms designed for maximum killing with right-wing domestic terrorism and you get what every credible expert and agency - including the FBI - considers a threat to national security. Without a proportionate national response, we are inviting the next slaughter.</p><p>Randy Schultz's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:randy@bocamag.com\">randy@bocamag.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0099230607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRY-9HS1-DY37-F2S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

While streaming video live on Facebook, he proceeded to shoot dozens of people, killing 42 of them, before driving to a second mosque and again opening fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the time he was apprehended, the shooter had killed 51 people, wounded 49 and broadcast the slaughter around the world. He also posted a 74-page manifesto titled \"The Great Replacement,\" drawing from white supremacist ideology and promoting ethnic cleansing.</p><p>The New Zealand shooting reflected a new and frightening development in the fight against extremism. The suspect exploited social media and global connectivity to advance his twisted ideology and used mass murder to amplify the message.</p><p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised a swift response and her government delivered in the days that followed. At her urging, the Parliament approved sweeping measures to ban semi-automatic weapons, including assault-style rifles and several other types of firearms, for public use.</p><p>Two months later, Ardern convened the Christchurch Call to Action Summit, an international gathering of world leaders, policy makers and executives from the technology sector to discuss ways to root out hateful ideology, violent extremism and terrorism from the internet.</p><p>At its conclusion, the leaders of many governments - including French President Emmanuel Macron, then-British Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - joined with representatives of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to sign a voluntary, non-binding pledge to do more to fight online extremism.</p><p>Though the summit was more of a brainstorming session than anything else and the final product was rather tepid and non-committal, President Donald Trump declined to attend and said the United States would not sign on to the \"Christchurch Call.\"</p><p>At the time, the administration said the document may not comport with the First Amendment - a valid concern - and warned against federal government overstepping its bounds by regulating the content available on platforms created and controlled by private, independent companies.</p><p>Yet, this president has been very quick to criticize, without evidence, those same companies for suppressing speech favorable to him. </p><p>In fact, the White House even directed the Department of Justice to probe ideological bias by big tech companies. So its protests ring somewhat hollow.</p><p>And it is interesting to review that refusal to participate in an international conference about stopping the spread of extremist ideology online in light of the weekend's events, which saw shootings in two American cities that together claimed 31 lives.</p><p>In El Paso, Texas, the man charged with a Saturday shooting that killed 22 people allegedly traveled to that city from Dallas in order to battle the Hispanic \"invasion\" of the United States. Reports indicate he told law enforcement following his arrest that he hoped to kill as many Mexicans as possible.</p><p>In an online manifesto he posted, the accused shooter specifically referenced the Christchurch attack as inspiration.</p><p>In Dayton, Ohio, the man who authorities say opened fire outside a nightclub early Sunday morning, killing nine people before he was shot and killed by police, may have harbored leftist sympathies, though there is not yet an indication his attack was ideologically driven.</p><p>However, a shooting one week prior in Gilroy, Calif., was allegedly perpetrated by someone hoping to advance the cause of white supremacy. And that's to say nothing of the 2015 shooting in Charleston, S.C., which the perpetrator claimed was intended to spark a race war.</p><p>According to a July 31 New York Times Op-Ed by Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant FBI director for counterintelligence, the FBI has made 90 arrests in domestic terrorism cases since October and 40% of its pending domestic terror investigations involve racially motivated extremism.</p><p>This isn't exclusively an American problem, though curbing this type of twisted worldview is a vexing challenge here, given the need to protect the rights enumerated in the First Amendment. Rather it's a global problem necessitating an international solution.</p><p>If the president is serious about fighting ideological extremism and white supremacy, reaching out to Ardern and working with the groundwork laid by the Christchurch Call is one way to swiftly turn words into action.</p><p>A version of this editorial appears in the Daily Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-VA0099230820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRY-9HS1-DY37-F36X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition>1ST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 7, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook was years off invention, likewise YouTube. The iPhone would not be released for another six years, and as such no one had yet dreamt up WhatsApp. More to the point, those \"foreign wars\" that breed extremism - at least according to <person><nameText>Jeremy Corbyn </nameText></person>and the more than 50 per cent of the population who apparently agree with him - in Afghanistan, in Iraq and in Libya, had not yet been fought.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But action was taken: stricter security at airports, pilots locking themselves in to the cockpit on planes (a policy that was itself the prime factor in an act of mass murder by a Germanwings pilot). And the targeted capture or assassination, by a broad coalition of western powers, of the leaders of the group that had perpetrated the attack, al-Qaeda, in the country that had happily hosted them, Afghanistan.</p><p>Sixteen years later, even in the wake of two deadly attacks on British streets in two weeks, it is hard to argue that the world, certainly the Western world, is not a safer place than it was then. In response to such atrocities, there will always need to be a call to action. This time, it is the internet and the big tech companies who must carry the can for these outrages.</p><p>\"We cannot go on as we are. Enough is enough,\" <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>said in a speech on Sunday morning. She would, she said, be \"working with other democratic governments to agree ways to regulate cyberspace and prevent the spread of extremism and terrorist planning online.\" But the Prime Minister knows as well as anyone that, for example, international agreements to stop Isis posting its propaganda videos on YouTube will make virtually no difference. The fight she and the rest of us must win is against the ideology itself.</p><p>She said as much herself: \"We must do more - much more - to take on and defeat the evil ideology of Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes sectarianism. It is an ideology that promotes a false choice between our Western values of freedom, democracy and human rights and the religion of Islam. It is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth.\"</p><p>This is a far more complex challenge. Shutting down YouTube or cracking open WhatsApp does not kill off an idea, an idea that was arguably best expressed by Barack Obama in an interview with Vice News two years ago. He spoke specifically about Yemeni youth, but it is hard not to imagine such sentiment applying to the appalling people who did what they did in London and Manchester in the last two weeks.</p><p>\"I'm worried about how, even if ISIL is defeated, the underlying problem of disaffected Sunnis around the world ... where a young man who's growing up has no education, has no prospects for the future, is looking around and the one way he can get validation, power, respect is if he's a fighter. 'This looks like the toughest gang around, so let me affiliate with them, and now you're giving me a religious rationale for doing this.' That's a problem we're going to have, generally.\"</p><p>If May is serious that \"enough is enough\", tragic though it is, there will have to be some serious thinking into ending the appeal of this appalling ideology. Trying to put it behind a firewall will not work.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000028756643-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NR0-Y0N1-F072-454D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 6, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It suggests barring such companies from profiling and tracking of children, carrying out their behavioural monitoring or targeting them with advertisements, and undertaking any other processing of personal data that can cause significant harm to them.</p><p>Apart from the social media and technology giants, education tech companies like Bengaluru-based Byju's that provides online coaching services to children and gaming firms may also face restrictions if the recommendations are accepted.</p><p>The justification for such differential treatment arises from the recognition that children are unable to fully understand the consequences of their actions, the Srikrishna panel said in its recommendations submitted to the government on Friday.</p><p>This is only exacerbated in the digital world, where data collection and processing is largely opaque and mired in complex consent forms.</p><p>Though some of the websites and apps allow children to sign up if they are 13 years of age or older, their consent to the terms and conditions isn't valid under India's laws.</p><p>Under the Indian Contract Act 1872, a minor cannot enter into a contract  this would mean that they could not have consented to the terms and conditions of usage of websites and apps. The Srikrishna panel is recommending enforcement of this.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Instagram and Byju's were not immediately available for comment.</p><p>Since companies targeting children can't profile such children, track behavioural data and send targeted advertising the companies are dependent on, revenues maybe hit, said Kartik Maheshwari, leader for technology companies at law firm Nishith Desai Associates. I see a possible shift in business models from an advertisementdependent model to a subscription or even freemium model. The draft law requires companies to set up age-verification mechanisms and get parental consent of users under the age of 18 to process data. Some experts think it may lead to higher compliance costs but is a step in the right direction.</p><p>The provisions on child's consent will require companies to be more careful than they might currently be while handling data of children. While it's not possible to make exact predictions at this time, it seems likely that operationalising the Bill's provisions on child's consent will raise compliance costs for companies, said Nehaa Chaudhari, public policy lead at law firm TRA.</p><p>In the US, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act is applicable for those under the age of 13  this is what the social media majors currently follow in India, too. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has set the age limit for parental consent at 16.</p><p>Children are more vulnerable than adults, so longer the protection, the better. Everyone is interested in the generation that is coming, not the generation that has gone by. Everything that is popular today was once popular with teenagers. Companies would want a lower age, obviously, said Mishi Choudhary, legal director at the Software Freedom Law Center in New York and managing partner of Mishi Choudhary &amp; Associates in India.</p><p>It is important to note that children constitute a large constituency of users of the Internet  about a third of the total Internet users globally. In India, the potential is even bigger as 40% of India's population is below the age of 18, according to the latest census.</p><p>The fast-paced changes in our digital environment and open access to social media have led to the emergence of the new-age, digitally savvy citizen  more importantly, children and teenagers, said Jaspreet Singh, partner-cyber security at global consultancy EY. While this (proposed law) may indicate a surge in compliance costs for organisations, it will act as a positive step in the long term.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_37_30072018008001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXC-0FR1-JB3N-T2F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A Moody' espera que este continue a ser um ponto-chave para 2020 e al\u00e9m, porque n\u00e3o se espera que o crescimento relativamente baixo melhore significativamente a din\u00e2mica do emprego ou reduza a desigualdade de renda\", disse Assinatura. Na sua opini\u00e3o, este ano, na Am\u00e9rica Latina, o descontentamento social limitar\u00e1 a capacidade dos governos de definir medidas para uma consolida\u00e7\u00e3o or\u00e7amental substancial. \"Um aumento no descontentamento social pode resultar em aumento do risco pol\u00edtico, que por sua vez pode afetar perfis de cr\u00e9dito soberano.

Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.</p><p>Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative. A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Europeans agree that \"technology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against COVID-19.\" But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.</p><p>\" This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans. Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.</p><p> Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 percent of the Standard and Poor's 500 largest companies. - Profiting from crisis? - These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.</p><p> \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\" Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.</p><p> Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services. Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.</p><p> - Focus on Congress - The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.</p><p> Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook. \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\" Ives said in a note to clients.</p><p> - More battles - Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices. Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.</p><p> Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.</p><p> Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\" He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.</p><p> Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact. O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so.</p><p>\" But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time. \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG22072020037140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DM-0C51-F00C-63MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these companies in the economy.  Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers to stay connected and get needed goods and services.  Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.  Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.  A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Europeans agree that \"technology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against COVID-19.\"  But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.\" This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.  Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs; Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.  Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 percent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 largest companies.  - Profiting from crisis? -  These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.  \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\"  Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.  Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services.  Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.  - Focus on Congress -  The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.  Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.  Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.  \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\" Ives said in a note to clients.- battles -Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.  Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.  Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.  Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\"  He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.  O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so.\"  But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.  \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42654427101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DJ-BMK1-F07F-811H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues  over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these  companies in the economy.   Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers  to stay connected and get needed goods and services.   Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these  services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.   Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during  the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings I nstitution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.    A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70  percent of Americans and 65 percent of Europeans agree that \"technology  companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against  COVID-19.\"   But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments  \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.\"\u3000This is up 14  points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.   Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several  record highs;\u3000Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple  and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.   Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market  value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 percent of the Standard &amp;  Poor's 500 largest companies.   Profiting from crisis?   These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic  upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from  its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.   \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that  people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these  businesses thrive.\"   Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon,  Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring  in the pandemic.   Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in  e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its  range of services.   Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing  in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott  seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.   Focus on Congress   The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday  in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.    Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations  into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.   Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and  that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for  Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.   \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\"  Ives said in a note to clients.   More battles   Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's  effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.   Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but  the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for  everyone.   Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased  against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists  have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content  and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a  \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.   Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful  content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of  the pandemic went out the window.\"   He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate  citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact  tracing.   Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as  Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by  others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.   O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big  Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly  so.\"   But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are  unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.   \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are  a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42661966372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DS-B1H1-F07F-84SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Sin Chew Daily</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these companies in the economy.    Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers to stay connected and get needed goods and services.    Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.    Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.    A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Europeans agree that \"technology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against COVID-19.\"    But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.\"  This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.    Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs;  Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.    Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 percent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 largest companies.    These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.    \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\"    Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.    Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services.    Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.    The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.    Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.    Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.    \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\" Ives said in a note to clients.    Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.    Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.    Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.    Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\"    He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.    Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.    O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so.\"    But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.    \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.   \u00a9  2020 AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42660616801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-8351-F07F-8151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Japan Today</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;
