The latest version of Fortnite contains a payment system that lets player transactions bypass Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, preventing the firms from collecting their typical 30 percent cut.    Apple, which does not allow users of its popular devices to download apps from anywhere but its App Store, booted the game from its online marketplace, followed later Thursday by Google.    Epic quickly filed a federal lawsuit against Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of wielding monopoly power.    The game-maker called on a federal judge to order Apple to stop its \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d and invalidate the tech giant\u2019s rules requiring app developers to pay the company 30 percent of transactions.    The suit said Epic is not seeking favorable treatment, but is asking the court to order Apple to change its commission structure for all developers.    Apple said Fortnite was pulled after \u201cEpic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users.\u201d    Google followed suit and removed Fortnite from its Play store for mobile devices powered by its Android software.    \u201cFor game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users,\u201d Google said in reply to an AFP inquiry.    Gamers will still be able to play Fortnite on their mobile devices, though Apple users will no longer be able to receive updates because those would need to come through the App Store.    Android users can still download updates directly from Epic.    Ruling the App Store    Apple has in recent months come under fire for the tight grip it has on the App Store, with the issue coming up during a heated congressional antitrust hearing last month.    \u201cApple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation,\u201d the lawsuit argued.    \u201cApple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear.\u201d    The Silicon Valley colossus has defended its position, saying its commission\u2014which can drop to 15 percent in the second year for subscriptions\u2014helps it keep apps and users safe from hackers and scammers.    \u201cEpic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we\u2019re glad they\u2019ve built such a successful business on the App Store,\u201d Apple said.    \u201cThe fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.\u201d    Fortnite has been played by some 350 million people around the world since its release in 2017. Set in a virtual world, players must survive by searching for weapons and resources while eliminating competitors.    It is also a popular e-sports title in which spectators watch expert players compete, in some cases for cash prizes.    Epic is taking a \u201crisky and calculated path\u201d by going after Apple at a time that the App Store is under scrutiny by antitrust regulators, reasoned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.    \u201cThis is a high stakes game of poker being played,\u201d Ives said.    \u201cApple needs to make sure the Epic challenge, which is timely in light of anti-trust swirls and growing opposition to Big Tech within the Beltway, does not create a ripple impact which developers globally are watching carefully,\u201d Ives said.

Among corporate-friendly Democrats and 'Never Trump' Republicans, the presumption is that American politics will return to the neoliberal path set by Reagan, and core ideas about limited government and free markets will remain static.Progressives are resisting this return to the default settings of American politics, pressuring Biden to set a new course. On the right, the future is more uncertain. However, at least one prominent Republican, Sen. </p><p>Josh Hawley (R-MO), is gesturing toward refining Trump's populism into a far more disciplined counterrevolution to the goals of the left. Although inchoate, post-Trump populism is evolving into a right-wing conception of statecraft that allows for a mixed economy dominated by 'patriotic' firms\u2014something long considered alien to mainstream American conservatism.Hawley's politics advances the communitarian nationalist framework of heterodox conservative intellectuals[2] and 'anti-globalist' media personalities, which Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) have also flirted with. Of course, it's far from guaranteed that this will become Republicans' dominant philosophy; it's just as likely that the right will further descend into rank conspiracy-mongering. But with an emphasis on productive national capitalism, as opposed to global capitalism, the populist right could very well coalesce the GOP around a figure whose platform resembles the 'social' nationalism of Europe's radical right, marrying industrial policy and a moderately expanded welfare state with conservative social values and an anti-immigrant agenda. If there is one ascendant Republican leader who could undertake that transformation, it's Hawley.AMONG HAWLEY'S STRENGTHS is his deceptive appearance, in which he comes across as merely another soldier for the Christian right whose populist rhetoric belies his elite rsum. A Stanford- and Yale-educated lawyer who led Hobby Lobby's Supreme Court fight against the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act and later tried to overturn the ACA as Missouri's attorney general, Hawley decisively won Claire McCaskill's Senate seat in 2018, continuing the GOP's rout of purple- and red-state Senate Democrats that began in the 2014 midterms[3]. Early profiles of Hawley in national publications like The Atlantic[4] and New Republic[5] painted him as a folksier yet more intellectual version of your standard congressional Republican. His ties to Koch money and support[6] for a right-to-work bill in Missouri during his campaign for attorney general, these articles concluded, did not differentiate him from his party's reflexive embrace of big business.Indeed, in most respects, Hawley remains an unremarkable Trump loyalist. FiveThirtyEight calculates[7] that he agrees with the Trump administration almost 85 percent of the time, which has included supporting the border wall, co-sponsoring legislation[8] to restrict legal immigration, and attempting to formally dismiss[9] the impeachment process as 'bogus.' Consistent with his party's deepening suspicion of international institutions and Trump's flirtation with trade wars, Hawley is also an avowed China hawk[10].Before the pandemic, Hawley stood out for his fixation on how to curb the concentrated power of Big Tech[11]. His critique has encompassed anti-monopoly and data privacy stances, as well as hackneyed assertions about the censorship of conservative speech on social media and search engines. To the extent they're sincere, Hawley's antitrust beliefs possibly date to the book he wrote in college on Theodore Roosevelt. But as far as policy niches go, his crusade against Big Tech was visible but safe terrain for a new Republican senator courting coverage on partisan cable news.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[12]More recently, Hawley has amplified his call to revive American industry and challenge international trade priorities. In May, he drew attention for proposing to 'abolish' the World Trade Organization in a Senate speech[13] and New York Times op-ed, arguing that a new trade system should be developed 'without compromising nations' economic sovereignty and their internal control of their own economies.' Though he fumbled the origins of the post-Cold War acceleration of free trade and outsourced manufacturing, Hawley has evinced a clear grasp of how deindustrialization has afflicted smaller cities and towns, unlike his mostly indifferent Republican colleagues. Powerful U.S. multinationals and financial firms have for decades encouraged conservatives to ignore this consequence of globalization, yet Hawley makes it one of his core themes.Beneath Hawley's preppy exterior and unwavering loyalty to Trump lies a deeply ideological interpretation of political purpose and social order. It reflects the conviction that conservatism equals moral governance, not anti-government politics. As such, Hawley is invested in a narrative of national betrayal that holds both parties culpable for moral, social, and economic decline. This expands upon Trump's theme of American carnage, threatening to turn his superficial, fleeting challenge to entrenched economic elites into a more forceful critique.Hawley has evinced a clear grasp of how deindustrialization has afflicted smaller cities and towns, unlike his mostly indifferent Republican colleagues. In a speech[14] at last summer's National Conservatism Conference\u2014a title whose foreboding historical echoes organizers and attendees must have willfully ignored\u2014Hawley decried a 'cosmopolitan consensus,' determined to implement 'closer and closer economic union, more immigration, more movement of capital, more trade on whatever terms.' According to Hawley, this consensus has enriched elites in finance, tech, and entertainment, while leaving Middle America with 'flat wages, lost jobs, declining investment, and declining opportunity.' The themes resembled Hawley's first Senate speech[15], which also pitted an 'arrogant aristocracy' against a disrespected, lonely, despairing American middle. Hawley largely eschews the 'individual responsibility' politics of traditional conservative thought, instead attempting a philosophical fusion between communitarianism, as expressed in his praise for 'strong religious communities' and traditional marriage, and a right-wing vision of an activist state.Far more than any Republican angling to extend the party's hold on working-class whites, Hawley is assimilating the 'social' nationalism characteristic of European right-wing populists like France's Marine Le Pen and Poland's Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. While tailored to the political dynamics of each country, 'social' nationalism reflects a strategic move toward the left on economic issues, often encompassing welfare benefits, higher wages, public services, housing, infrastructure, and industrial policy. Beyond the familiar welfare chauvinism that seeks to exclude immigrants and refugees from state benefits, Europe's most prominent right-wing populists aim to prove they represent a vast precariat alienated from the continent's global cities, and that only they can restore each country's national cohesion through a strong state.Since Europe's widespread imposition of austerity measures following the financial crisis of 2008-2009, these populists have honed a policy-based vision of right-wing solidarity that recalls early strands of fascism[16] that were more overtly critical of capitalism, which split labor's support for social democratic and communist parties. Amidst an unprecedented economic crisis, it is a political model primed for export and Americanization, especially in light of the United States' stark regional inequalities[17].

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[18]IN HIS MOST ideological speeches, Hawley has already employed the Euro-populist framework to dramatize his calls for a new social contract. However, the global pandemic has created an opportunity for Hawley to test the boundaries of Republican policymaking. The objective is twofold: to elevate Hawley as a future savior of the party, and to hone an image as a sincere public servant that can transcend polarization, without giving the appearance of betraying Trump.As the pandemic cratered the economy, Hawley emerged as one of the few Republican senators calling for direct cash assistance as well as a solution to keep workers on payroll. Before passage of the CARES Act and its weekly provision of $600 in additional unemployment insurance through July, Hawley introduced a plan[19] to provide monthly transfers of $1,446 to $2,206 for families with one to three children. While the proposal excluded individuals and was modest compared to progressive calls for a monthly universal basic income of $2,000 for the pandemic's duration, it demonstrated Hawley's eagerness to position himself as a rare figure on the right willing to provide economic relief to working families beyond a single stimulus check.More surprising was his 'Rehire America' plan[20], which aimed to stave off the explosion of unemployment insurance claims as the national lockdown went into effect in late March. The plan envisioned the federal government covering up to 120 percent of business payroll for all rehired workers and 80 percent of wages for businesses facing revenue shortfalls, capped at $50,000 per worker. In a New York Times interview[21] in late April, Hawley flexed his relative independence from Republican economic orthodoxy, touting that he consulted economists across the political and ideological spectrum to develop his plan. Although it went nowhere in the Senate, it notably tilted toward the recovery programs[22] implemented by Western and Northern Europe. A more expansive version of this payroll-support concept has been embraced across the Democratic ideological spectrum, from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), though the House version didn't make it into the Democrats' pandemic response bill, the HEROES Act.Part of Hawley's broader strategy is to be recognized as a responsible public servant 'just doing [his] job[23],' which has entailed occasional bipartisanship with some of the Senate's more economically progressive Democrats. Last summer, he introduced a bill[24] with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) to close the U.S. trade deficit through new taxes on foreign capital inflows. Following reports that debt collectors and some banks were seizing stimulus payments[25] from indebted people, Hawley joined Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in demanding[26] the Treasury Department act to ensure no one was denied their full relief check. When the dire shortage in medical supplies came to light in advance of the shutdown, Hawley introduced an act[27] to secure critical supply chains; he has since signaled interest in working further with Baldwin and Brown on industrial policy[28]. As public-interest watchdogs and investigative reporters sounded the alarm over the gargantuan corporate bailouts in the CARES Act and related bills, Hawley took aim[29] at United Airlines for reducing thousands of employees' hours despite protections against this in the airline bailout terms, insisting that United return the money if it did not reverse course.Most of these forays into areas of government oversight and public welfare have been just that: loose threads of public statements, letters of concern, and proposed legislation. Despite having no major legislative impact, Hawley's shrewd instinct for a long-term political calculus has been on display throughout the pandemic. He has earned bursts of attention for acknowledging the severity of the economic crisis, while most of his party has resisted extending more aid to struggling Americans. This has given him the luxury of building a policy portfolio with a few seemingly bold, heterodox positions that could distinguish him from his party's leadership in the event of an electoral collapse in November, without having to singularly own a piece of actual legislation.Of course, Hawley's rhetorical flourishes and gestures toward economic heterodoxy cannot entirely mask his evasion of deeper, more structural causes of inequality. His silence, for instance, on the penurious federal minimum wage and obfuscation of the role of unions in securing shared prosperity illustrate the limits to his attempt to assemble a few pro-worker bona fides.Because he cannot possibly denounce the litany of firms, executives, and dark-money entities behind decades of Republican assault on the U.S. welfare state, Hawley's narrow critique of capitalism can only serve to advance an illiberal conception of the social peace. On one hand, his ideas echo the century-old Republican prescription that a protective tariff serves industry and labor alike. On the other hand, his patchwork approach to industrial policy suggests a neo-corporatist agenda, in which a privileged segment of labor can have input on wages and benefits, but not challenge the broader regulatory environment. That trade-off, which would strain and divide the labor movement, would also create major obstacles to a worker-led and internationalist Green New Deal as the country and the globe near an irreversible climate crisis.Despite having no major legislative impact, Hawley's shrewd instinct for a long-term political calculus has been on display throughout the pandemic. Like his European counterparts, Hawley is much more in his element lambasting the depredations of foreign or 'cosmopolitan' capital that sap the national strength embodied by humble, 'left behind' citizens. His lamentations over today's 'shrinking middle' reflect the ahistorical view that economic life is shaped between virtuous, patriotic capitalism and its parasitic opposite. This stokes Trumpian resentment toward 'globalist' elites for their support of multiculturalism and immigration, which in Hawley's worldview most jeopardize Middle America's cohesion and traditions.What is clear enough is that Hawley's modulated apostasy on free-market ideology is no mere exercise. His political icon is Theodore Roosevelt, whose 'new nationalism' attempted to curtail labor's ratcheted militancy through moderate concessions from capital and the state. Should he seek the presidency in 2024, Hawley's favorable attributes\u2014he is telegenic, has intellectual curiosity, and lacks overt malice\u2014wildly surpass those of Tom Cotton, another contender for Trump's heir.IT REMAINS TO be seen whether Hawley is the kind of politician who would actually follow through on a few measures that would anger Wall Street and the Republican donor class in the pursuit of higher office. The appeals to working people that would be required in 2024, however, are contingent on who is elected in November and what is done to maximize economic recovery. Against a backdrop of mounting bottom-up pressure, improving the real economy would at a minimum include meaningful antitrust legislation, a revamped industrial policy, expanded child care and paid family leave, raising the minimum wage, and a major infrastructure plan. A figure like Hawley, who could manipulate mainstream media into portraying him as the right's answer to Elizabeth Warren, will have ample ideological space to confound corporate Democrats while making a forceful pitch to voters willing to trade zombie neoliberalism for a modicum of economic well-being.Between the country's extreme polarization and worsening inequality, the stakes couldn't be higher for Democratic policymakers over the next four years. This summer's nationwide revival of Black Lives Matter protests granted a glimmer of hope that public opinion is recognizing how deleterious and pervasive racism and white supremacy continues to be in the United States. In a matter of weeks, protesters exposed the vulnerabilities of complacent Democrats, but more significantly, they blindsided the right. The reactions have varied between authoritarian bloodlust, disbelief of calls to defund the police, and somber appeals to perhaps a now fictive silent majority.Two days before Cotton previewed his unvarnished neofascism in a notorious New York Times op-ed, Hawley gave a speech[30] on the Senate floor that tried to reconcile the outmoded principle of color blindness with a circumspect condemnation of the police brutality George Floyd and other Black Americans have suffered. He then pivoted to a rebuke of rioters, a defense of the overall integrity of American police departments, and a sermonizing message that economic policies that provided dignity from rural America to the 'urban core' could bring about national healing.That speech could be seen as evidence of an idea to run as a 'uniter' in 2024, but Hawley does not seem prepared for how rapidly political ground is shifting. The same, though, could be said for Joe Biden.Despite a new political reality defined by the pandemic and protests against police violence, Biden's general-election campaign strategy has mostly affirmed the perception that the country's crises begin and end with Trump. Yet the myriad forms of racial, economic, and other social inequalities that have crystallized into the most sweeping rejection of American political order since the 1960s demonstrate that a return to the status quo ante Biden represents is no less morally bankrupt for America's multiracial working class than the routine perfidy of contemporary Republicanism. Insofar that a Democratic victory in November is predicated on a voter desire for normalcy, the dramatic decline[31] in Trump's support among boomers suggests Biden's resolutely nonideological appeal to decency, stability, and competence is the surest path. But if Biden governs under the myth that society prefers gradualism at any cost, he will be as hard-put as ever in meeting progressive demands that are antithetical to his conception of what American politics is fundamentally about.Set next to Biden's promise to 'restore the soul of this nation,' Hawley's own vision of national cohesion seems no more corny or quixotic. It adapts Sherrod Brown's refrain about 'the dignity of work' while weaving a narrative about an honorable middle and working class under the foot of self-serving elites. The untrained ear will miss the anti-Semitic connotations in Hawley's attacks on cosmopolitanism, but it might perceive in his critique of America's power structure a broad agreement with Bernie Sanders.Of the foreseeable contenders, Hawley has shown every inclination to sanitize and yet further radicalize the Trumpist trajectory. Hawley's attempt to acknowledge grievances of the 'urban core' is likewise more deliberate than innocuous. Where Trump's white nationalism fuses shock-jock provocation with the crude invective of George Wallace, Hawley has a preacher's conviction in the rightness of a patriarchal social order, one that would reinforce the country's racial hierarchy but not openly disparage the basic dignity of racial minorities\u2014at least those who are citizens. Anachronistic appeals to color blindness may well provide a balm to sections of the middle and working classes fatigued or threatened by the more militant calls for justice that today's activists utilize.Therein lie the qualities that make Hawley's ascent in national politics both compelling and unnerving to watch. His deft fluctuation between solemn tributes to traditional values and community and fiery, anti-elite rhetoric exemplifies the choreographed mass politics of the radical right. In order to rehabilitate the Republican Party, it is very likely that its next presidential nominee will offer a Faustian bargain to reform the country's miserly social contract, dividing the working class and further siphoning off white moderates who fetishize, above all else, romantic notions of decency, decorum, and leadership. Of the foreseeable contenders, Hawley has shown every inclination to sanitize and yet further radicalize the Trumpist trajectory. Such a ploy would be especially potent if Washington's chronic dysfunction fails to abate.The mounting clash between an activist left, a neoliberal center depleted of vision and mandate, and an ever more illiberal right is dissolving one myth of American exceptionalism: that the modern fragmentation and realignment of political parties endemic to Europe's developed democracies cannot happen here. Another myth is also in the process of being disproven: that a critique of capitalism could not possibly take form on the right, let alone within the top ranks of a political party more associated with the zealous expansion of 'free markets' than any other in the history of the world.As the economy continues to undergo grave turmoil, the left and the mainstream of the Democratic Party, while antagonists, remain bound in their fear of Republican nihilism. But a more potent fusion of economic nationalism and traditionalism could radically reshape our politics, depriving the warring factions of the center and left of a sound way forward. While fossil fuel industries and Wall Street would still profit handsomely under a future President Josh Hawley, 'America First' would become an entrenched creed among anyone who felt Republican policies had rescued them. The dangers for society and the climate should be explicit, and yet the Democratic Party remains dangerously unprepared, fearing more its own metamorphosis than that of its opposition.

Conscious of setting an arbitrary threshold for \"obscenity\", he admitted defeat, concluding: \"Perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it ...\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic populism is similarly hard to define. Yet there is plenty of it around in the US and, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">whether it be Democrat presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren</url> and Bernie Sanders on the Left or President Donald Trump and Fox News host Tucker Carlson on the Right, we should know it when we see or hear it. The stakes mean it's too important not to.</p><p>Plenty of conventional descriptions of economic populism are inadequate. Often the term is used to signal disapproval of a policy idea - a sort of \"neoliberalism\" moniker for the age of Trump and Brexit. Left-wing chattering classes believe that both are \"populist\" movements, and thus anything they do must, by definition, be \"populist\" too. For these commentators, populism is just another term for demagoguery.</p><p>Others wrongly see populism as synonymous with widely popular, but misguided, \"common sense\" economic ideas, such as \"cutting immigration to raise wages\". Its defining feature is supposedly how it ignores or dismisses the knowledge of professional economists, exemplified by Michael Gove's declaration that \"we've had enough of experts\". Populism's opposite, in this view, is technocracy or \"expert rule.\"</p><p>But neither of these definitions get to the heart of trends dominating American politics. Listen to Trump or Warren long enough and clear patterns emerge that trigger your inner economic populism alarm.</p><p>Most obvious is the way issues are framed. Populists pitch themselves as true representatives of \"the people\", struggling to overcome some \"elite\" who undermine \"the people's\" interest. Populism's first characteristic is to divide society between a supposed broad interest and an establishment elite quelling it.</p><p>Villains and their supposed crimes can differ. For Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, those rigging the system to our detriment are the rich; mega-corporations; fossil fuel companies; big tech; and pharmaceutical firms. They supposedly buy elections, resist needed welfare programs, rewrite regulations in their interests, stitch up trade deals that undermine workers, rip off consumers and profiteer off our\u00a0health.</p><p>For Trump and Carlson, the nefarious elites instead are the Chinese, the cultural America-loathing Left, useless past negotiators and presidents, international institutions and, again, big tech companies. Their misdeeds? Selling out or ripping off American workers on trade; wanting to flood the country with migrants who hate it; and stamping out conservative voices on social media.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">A key feature of populism</url> as a \"thin ideology\" is the idea of an elite working against broad majoritarian interests. Populists can disagree on who the \"elites\" and \"the people\" they represent are, although it's remarkable how often they agree that corporate America is an enemy. The opposite of this populism then isn't elitism, but pluralism - the idea that multiple identities and interests can compete and coexist within a free society.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">Ryan Bourne | Latest columns</url></p><p>Economic populism, almost by definition, is therefore anti-market. A healthy market economy is characterised by individual choices, voluntary trades and individuals pursuing their own self-interests. Our wealth comes from bottom-up activity, not top-down decisions. Claiming that a political representative of \"the people\" knows better how to achieve aggregate goals than a free people erodes any sort of limiting principle on government action. Paradoxically, populism produces demands for new restrictions on transient business \"elites\" in favour of emboldening another elite, government officials, working in the politician's name.</p><p>But what makes populism doubly dangerous is the way its practitioners imply there are big wins out there for \"the people\" available at no cost. Populists' policy programmes claim the elites are denying us something that the self-styled people's representative can deliver without trade-offs, lost opportunities and unintended consequences.</p><p>President Trump didn't make the case that building a border wall to reduce illegal immigration would just be net beneficial for US taxpayers. He claimed that Mexico would pay for it entirely. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">Putting tariffs on China</url> wasn't justified as a necessary evil to bring the Chinese into negotiations. Trump claimed Chinese companies would pay\u00a0them, with no effect on American\u00a0consumers.</p><p>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren promise major expansions of the US welfare state in a European direction - \"wins\" for ordinary people that wealthy interests supposedly deny Americans through their political lobbying. Again though, both wave away claims this will require European levels of indirect taxation or that anyone would suffer worse healthcare. It is \"the rich\", of course, who will pay.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">Economic Intelligence newsletter in-article</url></p><p>Occasionally, reality intervenes. President Trump this week delayed additional tariffs on a host of imported Chinese goods, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">saying he didn't want to hurt American shoppers before Christmas</url> . In one swoop, he blew his \"China pays\" rhetoric out of the water.</p><p>Similarly, you could see Bernie Sanders' facial panic in a recent debate when it was pointed out that paying US government rates for all treatments would lead to widespread hospital bankruptcies.</p><p>But populist stances, once adopted, are difficult to shake off. Once \"elites\" have been identified as enemies, it's difficult to rehabilitate them and argue their success strengthens society. Once trade-offs have been dismissed, it's difficult to warn people that something might prove costly to them.</p><p>Populism is poisoning the US economic discourse. The very idea of a majoritarian interest rides roughshod on its liberal and limited government inheritance.

Conscious of setting an arbitrary threshold for \"obscenity\", he admitted defeat, concluding: \"Perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I know it when I see it ...\" Economic populism is similarly hard to define. Yet there is plenty of it around in the US and, whether it be Democrat presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on the Left or President Donald Trump and Fox News host Tucker Carlson on the Right, we should know it when we see or hear it. The stakes mean it's too important not to.</p><p>Plenty of conventional descriptions of economic populism are inadequate. Often the term is used to signal disapproval of a policy idea - a sort of \"neoliberalism\" moniker for the age of Trump and Brexit. Left-wing chattering classes believe that both are \"populist\" movements, and thus anything they do must, by definition, be \"populist\" too. For these commentators, populism is just another term for demagoguery.</p><p>Others wrongly see populism as synonymous with widely popular, but misguided, \"common sense\" economic ideas, such as \"cutting immigration to raise wages\". Its defining feature is supposedly how it ignores or dismisses the knowledge of professional economists, exemplified by Michael Gove's declaration that \"we've had enough of experts\". Populism's opposite, in this view, is technocracy or \"expert rule.\"</p><p>But neither of these definitions get to the heart of trends dominating American politics. Listen to Trump or Warren long enough and clear patterns emerge that trigger your inner economic populism alarm.</p><p>Most obvious is the way issues are framed. Populists pitch themselves as true representatives of \"the people\", struggling to overcome some \"elite\" who undermine \"the people's\" interest. Populism's first characteristic is to divide society between a supposed broad interest and an establishment elite quelling it.</p><p>Villains and their supposed crimes can differ. For Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, those rigging the system to our detriment are the rich; mega-corporations; fossil fuel companies; big tech; and pharmaceutical firms. They supposedly buy elections, resist needed welfare programs, rewrite regulations in their interests, stitch up trade deals that undermine workers, rip off consumers and profiteer off our health.</p><p>For Trump and Carlson, the nefarious elites instead are the Chinese, the cultural America-loathing Left, useless past negotiators and presidents, international institutions and, again, big tech companies. Their misdeeds? Selling out or ripping off American workers on trade; wanting to flood the country with migrants who hate it; and stamping out conservative voices on social media.</p><p>A key feature of populism as a \"thin ideology\" is the idea of an elite working against broad majoritarian interests. Populists can disagree on who the \"elites\" and \"the people\" they represent are, although it's remarkable how often they agree that corporate America is an enemy. The opposite of this populism then isn't elitism, but pluralism - the idea that multiple identities and interests can compete and coexist within a free society.</p><p>Economic populism, almost by definition, is therefore anti-market. A healthy market economy is characterised by individual choices, voluntary trades and individuals pursuing their own self-interests. Our wealth comes from bottom-up activity, not top-down decisions.</p><p>Claiming that a political representative of \"the people\" knows better how to achieve aggregate goals than a free people erodes any sort of limiting principle on government action. Paradoxically, populism produces demands for new restrictions on transient business \"elites\" in favour of emboldening another elite, government officials, working in the politician's name.</p><p>But what makes populism doubly dangerous is the way its practitioners imply there are big wins out there for \"the people\" available at no cost.</p><p>Populists' policy programmes claim the elites are denying us something that the self-styled people's representative can deliver without trade-offs, lost opportunities and unintended consequences.</p><p>President Trump didn't make the case that building a border wall to reduce illegal immigration would just be net beneficial for US taxpayers. He claimed that Mexico would pay for it entirely. Putting tariffs on China wasn't justified as a necessary evil to bring the Chinese into negotiations. Trump claimed Chinese companies would pay them, with no effect on American consumers.</p><p>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren promise major expansions of the US welfare state in a European direction - \"wins\" for ordinary people that wealthy interests supposedly deny Americans through their political lobbying. Again though, both wave away claims this will require European levels of indirect taxation or that anyone would suffer worse healthcare. It is \"the rich\", of course, who will pay.</p><p>Occasionally, reality intervenes.</p><p>President Trump this week delayed additional tariffs on a host of imported Chinese goods, saying he didn't want to hurt American shoppers before Christmas. In one swoop, he blew his \"China pays\" rhetoric out of the water.</p><p>Similarly, you could see Bernie Sanders' facial panic in a recent debate when it was pointed out that paying US government rates for all treatments would lead to widespread hospital bankruptcies.</p><p>But populist stances, once adopted, are difficult to shake off. Once \"elites\" have been identified as enemies, it's difficult to rehabilitate them and argue their success strengthens society. Once trade-offs have been dismissed, it's difficult to warn people that something might prove costly to them.</p><p>Populism is poisoning the US economic discourse. The very idea of a majoritarian interest rides roughshod on its liberal and limited government inheritance. Its dismissal of trade-offs ensures an arms race of \"wins\", which somebody else will pay for.</p><p>Let us hope that Americans, like Justice Stewart, recognise \"populism\" for what it is, and check its growth before it's too late.</p><p>Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute</p><p>'Listen to Trump or Warren long enough and clear patterns emerge that trigger your inner populism alarm'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Reality intervened when Trump delayed tariffs on a host of imported Chinese goods, saying he didn't want to hurt American shoppers</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-152028664</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTT-XYV1-DYTY-C17X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

The city\u2019s public  ban  (pdf) took effect immediately and the private  ban  (pdf) is set to take effect on January 1, 2021.     Jann Carson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Oregon, said in a statement late Wednesday that \u201cwith today\u2019s vote, the community made clear we hold the real power in this city.\u201d    \u201cWe hope the passage of this landmark legislation in Portland will spur efforts to enact statewide legislation that protects Oregonians, across our state, from the broad range of ways that our biometric information is collected, stored, sold, and used without our permission,\u201d said Carson.     Fight for the Future deputy director Evan Greer tweeted that \u201cevery city council should follow suit\u201d by enacting their own bans on corporate use of facial recognition technology, which she described as \u201cjust as dangerous and discriminatory as government and law enforcement use.\u201d    Greer noted that the new ban on use of facial recognition technology by private businesses \u201cmeans stores can\u2019t use it on their customers, or on people walking by. It\u2019s a huge deal.\u201d        The bans passed with overwhelming support despite Amazon spending more than $24,000 lobbying against them, along with opposition from local banks and Big Tech industry associations. Its an enormous victory for the global movement to #BanFacialRecognition &amp; end racist surveillance   \u2014 Evan Greer (@evan_greer) September 9, 2020      Corporate use of facial recognition can be just as dangerous and discriminatory as government and law enforcement use. This technology, like nuclear or biological weapons, poses such a profound threat to humanity that it can\u2019t be regulated. It must be abolished.   \u2014 Evan Greer (@evan_greer) September 9, 2020     The Portland ordinances were led by Portland\u2019s Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler and City Council Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, who celebrated the measures as \u201cthe nation\u2019s most comprehensive facial recognition technology ban.\u201d         \u201cThis is an exciting opportunity to set a national example by protecting the right of privacy of our community members, especially our most vulnerable and over-policed members,\u201d Hardesty wrote in a  series of tweets  Wednesday. \u201cI refuse to sit back and watch our right to privacy and our civil rights be stripped away so that corporations can make more money.\u201d        Enjoy this piece?   \u2026 then let us make a small request.

The genre works on fear plus just enough hope that if we are somehow smart enough we will be among the minority able to hold on to jobs in the decades ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Richard Baldwin's new book, The Globotics Upheaval: Globalisation, Robotics and the Future of Work (Hachette), published today, doesn't avoid the tough calls about the impact on our economies of offshore workers and automation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the American-born Swiss academic is more optimistic than many commentators. Indeed he suggests life could actually be better in the future - as long as we understand that the edge we have over the machines is our humanity. On the phone from Geneva where he is professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute, Baldwin suggests we need to spend less time worrying about what artificial intelligence and remote workers overseas workers can do more cheaply than us and focus on where we have the upper hand.</p><p>Says Baldwin: \"I think human ingenuity is infinite and we will eventually find new jobs for everybody. Our task is to figure out what those jobs will be doing and the way to do that is to figure out what globotics can't do.\" Globotics is Baldwin's generic word for the phenomenon of white-collar robots that will work for nothing and the new phase of globalisation led by tele-migrants who will work remotely for next to nothing. These workers will not be stopped by Mexican walls or border security but will happily and legally work for very low wages from their own countries.</p><p>None of this is especially new but Baldwin says the convergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning with cheap, remote white-collar workers is escalating at levels we cannot assimilate easily into our \"straight-line\" approach to progress.</p><p>Computer processing speeds double every 18 months, he writes. So, the increment in power between 2015 and 2017 was twice as large as all the progress in the previous 46 years. Draw this as a graph and we see that when the explosive growth of digital progress crosses our straight-line approach to the future, we experience a \"holy cow\" moment. The point is that we are still shocked by how fast work is changing in the 21st century.</p><p>The bad news is the potential for a backlash from disaffected blue and white-collar workers who together could cause even bigger headaches for our politicians than displaced manufacturing workers already have in places such as the US. The good news, says Baldwin, is that the upheaval could reduce rather than increase the gaps between workers - nurses armed with AI for diagnosis will win out compared with doctors, for example. The trick, says Baldwin, is to think about what the globots are not very good at - \"the human skills like managing people, empathy, creativity, ethics, integrating with large groups of people, sympathising with people\".</p><p>Baldwin says the literature often conflates job losses from manufacturing with those in ser-vices, even though only 10 per cent of the workforce is in factories.</p><p>\"It's a big, big mistake,\" he says. \"It's a little bit rough, but who cares?\" Industrial robots are certainly taking jobs but it's the \"software robots living in computers\" that preoccupy Baldwin. \"These automated things will take any kind of routine, data processing or rules-based elements out of our jobs,\" he says. \"The new jobs of the future for humans will emphasise the things the (robots) cannot do.\" This much we know, but the extra element in the coming revolution, according to Baldwin, is that machine language will erode human-based jobs even further. The capacity for machines to translate quickly increases hugely the job options for people living outside the West.</p><p>\"Chinese universities alone graduate eight million students a year, and many of them are underemployed and underpaid in China,\" Baldwin writes. \"Now that they can all speak 'good enough English' via Google Translate and similar software, special people in rich nations will suddenly find themselves less special. This international tidal wave of talent is coming straight for the good, stable jobs that have been the foundation of middle-class prosperity in the US and Europe and other high wage economies.\" What will be left will be jobs that absolutely need face-to-face interactions - jobs that are more human and necessarily more local, according to Baldwin. Here's where the hopeful bit comes in and why we should not make the mistake that this digital revolution will mimic the industrial and information technology revolutions of the past 300 years.</p><p>Says Baldwin: \"The shift from farms to factories went from about 1720 to 1970 and was driven by technology that was especially good for people who work with their hands, and indirectly good for people who work with their heads. It was very good for equality \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it sort of evened things out. From 1973 till 2016, when I think this (digital revolution) really got started, there was a technology (ICT) that was a better substitute for people who worked with their hands, but also better tools for people who worked with their heads. As a consequence there was a radical increase in market inequality everywhere and certainly in all the advanced economies.\" Some economies evened out the disparities with social welfare policies but overall the past half-century has helped people who were already ahead of the pack and hurt those who were behind.</p><p>\"Most people assume that digital technology will be just more of the same, but I think that is probably mis-thinking the whole thing,\" Baldwin says.</p><p>Our economies reward those - the doctors, lawyers, draftsmen, architects, tax accountants - who can mix human skills with experience in pattern recognition. But technology can use data sets to provide levels of pattern recognition that until now have been the preserve of highly paid, experienced workers.</p><p>\"What this (revolution) does is give more head to people who have heart but not more heart to people who have head,\" says Baldwin. \"Artificial intelligence can sometimes be viewed as augmented intelligence and the people whose intelligence it is augmenting the most are the middle mental skill kind of people. There will always be the AI geniuses who become billionaires (but) the question is whether this is going to help the doctor more or the nurse.\" The answer, of course, is that nurses will have most to gain because so much more diagnosis will be provided by data sets. Baldwin says he's hopeful that globotics will be a \"boost to the middle class and not just the upper class\".</p><p>None of this transformation will be smooth. The backlash will likely focus - as it has done recently - on big tech companies.</p><p>\"I suspect this is going to be a big issue in the 2020 US presidential election and some other ones,\" Baldwin says, with governments arguing they can help people adjust to change. \"It's about not (seeing) technology as being against workers but, rather, for workers.\" That, of course, is a long way from the populist approach taken by Donald Trump in the 2016 election. \"Trump was riding on the discontent of people who were hit by the last adjustment, the information and computer technology revolution that led to offshoring and automation of jobs,\" says Baldwin.</p><p>\"They gave the Democrats eight years under Obama, they gave the Republicans eight years under Bush. Nothing changed, so why not give this guy a try? But they got nothing out of it. Brexit, Trump, Le Pen, the Five Star Movement (in Italy) - none of them have solutions. It's like treating brain cancer with aspirin. It just makes them feel better. So I think they are going to be ripe to join people displaced by digital technology. There is this powder keg of discontent that came from the disruption from robots and China in the manufacturing sector and now we're going to add on the white-collar workers.\" It's not easy to predict which jobs will be sheltered from the storms but Baldwin draws on material from McKinsey and other researchers to suggest, for example, that 73 per cent of work in the accommodation and food sector could be lost to robots. Jobs that involve judgment, emotional intelligence and dealing with unexpected situations - such as education and healthcare - will lose far fewer: about 27 per cent to 36 per cent of jobs respectively.</p><p>Baldwin is optimistic that our \"human edge\" will provide shelter from the globots for a long time. Again he quotes McKinsey researchers to argue that it will take about 50 years for AI to attain top-level human performance in the four social skills so useful in the workplace: social and emotional reasoning; co-ordination with many different people; acting in emotionally appropriate ways; and social and emotional sensing.</p><p>Just as machines have limits, so do the tele-migrants because there are some workplace tasks that need \"real people to be in the same room at the same time\". Which is why Baldwin likes to talk about the potential for a \"more local, more human, community-based economy\".</p><p>He claims three things point to this: \" The jobs that will be left after the robots and tele-migrants take their slice of the work will require face-to-face interaction, making communities more local and probably more urban.</p><p>\" The jobs that will thrive after the \"globotics upheaval\" will stress humanity's great advantages such as creativity and innovativeness.</p><p>\" Once we manage the transition the globots will make us richer: cheaper goods mean we will be materially better off, for example.</p><p>\"The globotics revolution could mean soaring productivity that could finance a breakthrough to a new nirvana, a better society that offered fulfilling work and fostered more caring and sharing attitudes,\" Baldwin writes.</p><p>He concedes that in the short term it is hard to know how long that transition will take, something that is cold comfort for those rendered jobless. Even now, early in the revolution or transformation, as Baldwin calls it, citizens can feel powerless. Meanwhile, he argues governments must help workers adjust, foster job replacement, \"and if the pace turns out to be too great - slow it down\".</p><p>He argues we need more adjustment policies such as retraining programs, and income and relocation support, which have worked in Europe. Governments also must find a way to make rapid job displacement politically acceptable to most voters.</p><p>\"Politics is a fine art involving inspiration and leadership as well as concrete policies,\" Baldwin writes. \"But whatever they use, our political leaders will have to find ways of sharing the gains and pains, or at least offering a perception that everyone has a fighting chance of being a winner.</p><p>\"While tax-and-redistribute policies undoubtedly have to be part of this package, they cannot be the only thing, or even the main thing. People's lives are too tied up with their jobs to allow it. The challenge is ensuring that labour flexibility doesn't mean economic insecurity for workers. What is needed are policies like those in Denmark. The government allows firms to hire and fire freely but then commits to doing whatever it takes to help the displaced workers find new jobs.\" Baldwin says we will also see a move to \"shelterism\", where interest groups - such as taxi drivers - will try to use existing regulations to slow change. He cites privacy, health and safety and security regulations as examples of this \"micro\" pushback. At the macro level employment protection legislation around firing people could be used to slow automation.</p><p>And when employees can often feel bewildered in the face of big tech and an uncertain job outlook, Baldwin suggests we could all turn ourselves into \"data workers\" and operate in a new economic model. He cites the work of two Chicago writers, Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl in their book Radical Markets, published by Princeton University Press last year. The idea is that we treat the data that tech firms are already so blithely collecting from us as we would our labour and charge the firms for the use of it.</p><p>\"So, at present we have a model where data is capital,\" he says. \"I agree to use an iPhone and then I agree to let them use my voice data to train Siri. My data is capital as far as Apple is concerned. They get to do whatever they want. They've bought it. It's theirs. So the Radical Markets guys say, no let's treat it as labour, where you have to pay me copyright. That would change the economic relationship around completely.\" Above all, Baldwin says the pace of progress is not set by \"some abstract law of nature\".</p><p>We can control the speed of disruption: it's our choice.The Globotics Upheaval: Globalisation, Robotics and the Future of Work by Richard Baldwin is published by Hachette Australia ($32.99).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-1e1b22d2122a11e986cb1ccbd69c83d6de3c03574bad0a34cc73b173ead50f94</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V4S-CV91-F0JP-W4D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 8, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097LT</classCode><className>LABOR FORCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000688</classCode><className>FACTORY WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001696</classCode><className>TELECOMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

Drug-safety officials in the U.S. and Europe said Friday that they were looking into whether Sanofi heartburn medication Zantac and generic versions made by numerous manufacturers contain levels of the probable carcinogen NDMA that could pose a danger to patients. Ranitidine, as the drug is known in generic form, is an antacid and antihistamine used to treat and prevent a range of gastrointestinal disorders. </p><p>The chemical NDMA, or N-Nitrosodimethylamine, is a likely human carcinogen found in cooked or cured meats such as bacon, and is a common industrial byproduct.Zantac is made in Mexico and Sanofi sources its active ingredient from Spain, officials said. Lawmakers ask tech firms for documents in probe WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers investigating the market dominance of Big Tech on Friday asked Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple for a broad range of documents, marking a step forward in Congress' bipartisan probe of the companies. Letters went out to the four companies from the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee and its subcommittee on antitrust, which has been conducting a sweeping investigation of the companies and their impact on competition and consumers. The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. The move comes as scrutiny of the big tech companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. PG&amp;E reaches $11 billion deal with California wildfire insurers SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has agreed to pay $11 billion to a group of insurance companies representing claimants from deadly Northern California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 as the company tries to emerge from bankruptcy, the utility announced Friday. The utility said in a statement the tentative agreement was reached with insurance companies holding 85% of the insurance claims from fires that included the November 2018 blaze that destroyed the town of Paradise, killing 86 people. It does not include thousands of uninsured and underinsured fire victims who have filed their own claims against PG&amp;E, including for wrongful deaths. The insurers said in a separate statement the settlement is well below the $20 billion the companies had sought in bankruptcy court.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001099811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2H-FPY1-JBRC-V004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002MIK</classCode><className>PG&amp;E CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00091HA</classCode><className>SANOFI SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC4931 ELECTRIC &amp;

Can the missteps be fixed before Ebola punishes the global economy? I'm Christine Romans.  This is \"CNN MONEY.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS:  Ebola exposing cracks in the world's most expensive health care system.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Something went wrong in that hospital.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS:  A second health care worker infected with Ebola.  Nurses saying they aren't getting the training they need.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Stop pointing fingers and fix the problem.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Is it a question of resources?  Federal funding for hospital preparedness has been cut in half since 2003, some members of Congress calling for millions more to be spent.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Today it's Ebola.  Tomorrow it will be something else unless we make the right investments.  </p><p>ROMANS:  The president says there will be no outbreak in America.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The dangers of a serious outbreak are extraordinarily low.  </p><p>ROMANS:  That as the epidemic in West Africa spreads.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We will go over 9,000 cases this week.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Private donors are stepping up, but as fear grows so will the financial damage.  Is Ebola's economic toll just beginning?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Dr. Joseph McCormick is a professor and regional dean of the University of Texas, School of Public Health.  He worked at the CDC in 1976 when it investigated the first Ebola epidemic in central Africa. Thank you so much for joining me, Dr. McCormick.  I want to ask you point-blank, is this a lack of funding for hospital preparedness, or is this just a culture that we're not ready here, yet, to deal with this?  </p><p>DR. JOSEPH MCCORMICK, REGIONAL DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Christine, I think this is an issue of culture and preparedness and far less about funding.  Let me give you an example. I think that in terms of hospital infections, the United States has one of the lowest levels of hospital infection rates in the world among developed countries.  And yet -- and I think what happened was, many people thought was, OK, we have a great job with hospital infections.  We're ready for handing Ebola.  I think that may be part of the issue at Presbyterian.  And unfortunately handling a viral illness like this is totally different.  And I think that may have played a role.  </p><p>Although there are plenty of people who say we still have too many hospital infections, we still don't do a good enough job of just washing hands for doctors and nurses.  That's still, you know, I think we saw 99,000 people get have a health care-acquired infection every year.  But this is Ebola.  This is different.  This is something that has to be handled very carefully and appropriately, immediately. There can be no mistakes.  The two nurses infected in Dallas have been moved to a specialized bio-containment unit, one in Georgia, one in Maryland.  There are some four facilities like this in the country. Do we need to scale up on that?  </p><p>MCCORMICK:  I don't think so, because I think what that means is, we're trying to replace good old-fashioned competence and training with technology, and I don't think that's going to work.  </p><p>ROMANS:  So competence and training, what do we need to do, then?  If we don't need to spend more money or build more bio-containment units, is this -- clearly webinars and websites with protocol isn't working.  </p><p>MCCORMICK:  Yes, we have to first of all have the correct protocol, and it wasn't there.  Secondly, this is the kind of training that means hands-on, and it means that the health care workers have to buy- in to the protocol.  It's not enough to give a webinar or a YouTube video.  You simply have to have boots on the ground training.  It has to be a group, in my opinion, that is dedicated to this and they're going to be the go-to group wherever there's a suspect case.  You have to have a protocol ready for when somebody walks in the door of your emergency room all the way to the time when you're finished.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Really interesting.  Dr. McCormick, so nice to see you.  Dr. Joseph McCormick, interesting that it's not necessarily just more money that's needed, but we need to change the culture and have different training, not necessarily more technology.  Thank you, sir, for joining us.  </p><p>I want to bring in CNN MONEY's Cristina Alesci.  She joins me now. You know, let's talk about the cost of this, let's talk about the response to the Ebola crisis in Africa in particular.  Private donors are starting to step in here.  Interesting.  Tell me about that.   CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Starting.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as Mark Zuckerberg pledged to this effort $50 million from Bill and Melinda Gates alone, $25 million from Mark Zuckerberg.  Some of that is going to aid organizations.  Some of it's going to actually the U.S. government organizations and units like the CDC.  Now, private sector donations are not enough, clearly. The U.N. said that it needs about $1 billion in a fund to go ahead and get ahead of the curve.  </p><p>ROMANS:  We are not there.  </p><p>ALESCI:  We are totally not there.  You're talking about $20 million in pledges, and the fund itself only has $100,000 in cash.  Now clearly there's money going to other organizations, but the U.N., it's clearly indicative of a shortfall.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Let's talk about the industries affected.  Interesting that the chocolate industry is actually affected by Ebola because it operates in these countries.  It's a $67 billion business, 26 global companies collectively donating $600,000.  Wait a minute.  Look at the profit number, look at the revenue number, look at what they're donating.  Could they do more?  </p><p>ALESCI:  Absolutely they could do more.  And 70 percent of the world's supply of cocoa beans actually comes from West Africa.  So you would think, if anybody has skin in the game, these guys have skin in the game.  </p><p>Now, granted, the high-producing countries are not the ones that are actually affected, but they are neighboring them, like the Ivory Coast right next door to Liberia.  So you would think that the chocolate companies would want to protect themselves.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Right.  </p><p>ALESCI:  In fact, Ivory Coast is so exposed that the CDC is actually sending staff down there to test its preparedness.  So it may not be in the country, but people are concerned that it could spread there. And look, you talk about $10 billion in profits.  Mars alone, one of the biggest manufacturers of chocolate, number one in market share, only gave $100,000.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Wow.  That is interesting and maybe a little bit of a wake-up call for corporate responsibility.  Thank you so much, Cristina Alesci.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>Coming up, another week and another wild ride on Wall Street.  Why you should not panic, next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  So, you know, October has a pretty bad wrap when it comes to the stock market, and so far this month it's living up to its bad reputation.  That lead our CNN MONEY top four this week.  Our CNN MONEY panel is here, Paul La Monica, Rana Foroohar, and Samuel Burke. OK, guys, another volatile week on Wall Street.  We're talking about 400-point swing on the Dow.  Paul, is there more selling or are there bargains here?  </p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  I think there are definitely bargains going forward, but that doesn't mean that the worst is over.  We could still have another steep sell-off because a lot of people are worried about Europe's economy.  Ebola's a big wild card.  But there are quality companies trading for a lot less money than they used to that have probably been oversold.  </p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  I agree.  Now, I think that the U.S. is still in some ways the prettiest house on the ugly block, right?  It doesn't feel that great here, but if you look at Europe about ready to tip into recession, Asia is slowing down, China is really having a debt crisis of its own right now, I think that we're going to see a lot more volatility, but I think that people will have a few better places to park their money ultimately than U.S. equities.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Every time we've had to have a pullback in the last two years of 10 percent, we haven't had it in the S&amp;P 500.  The NASDAQ had a full 10 percent correction and bounced right back, Samuel.  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, TECH BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  And there are lots of opportunities just because of what you're saying.  For instance, I was covering Netflix and Google this week.  Netflix down 26 percent.  But just a few hours later back up seven percent.  Wish I would have gone in.  Google down five percent at one point, an hour later, back up four percent.  </p><p>ROMANS:  But raise your hand, we shouldn't be surprised the market is going down.  It's not unpredictable here.  All of these factors are well known.  So does the fed do anything or does the Fed really get out of -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  I hope not.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  I hope not too.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  The rally that we saw on Thursday at the end of the day, a lot of it was due to one Fed member hinting that maybe QE lasts a little bit longer.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And a decent jobs number.  So you look at the internals of the American economy, it's not doing so bad.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  The Fed should act if the economy is weakening, don't you think?  </p><p>FAROOHOR:  Absolutely.  They've already put $4 trillion into the economy since the financial crisis.  We know that's created some bubbles.  And you know, we know that it's not doing much more for the real economy to put more money in it.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Lots for us to talk about, lots for us to watch.  If stocks are dropping, so are oil prices.  Oil down 25 percent from the peak this summer.  I think it's fair to say oil prices have plunged since June.  The national average for a gallon of regular gas down more than 20 cents in the last four weeks.  And Gas Buddy tells us that parts of the western U.S. and the Rocky Mountain states could see another drop of 15 to 30 cents a gallon.  The Energy Department says heating bills will also be lower this year.  What's driving this decline?  Is it only production in the U.S. up and worries about global demand?  </p><p>FAROOHOR:  It's two things.  Production in the U.S. is up because of the shale boom, but also, China is slowing down.  That's a big part of this.  For the last year China has been the single largest energy consumer in the world.  When they slow down, the price of oil drops.  </p><p>BURKE:  For every one cent that gas drops in the United States, that's $1.4 billion that Americans have to spend on something else.  And that's coming right -- </p><p>ROMANS:  It's like a tax cut. </p><p>BURKE:  Exactly.  That's even better than the last one for most people.  And this is coming right before the big holiday buying season.  So people might have even more to spend, could be good for consumers.  </p><p>ROMANS:  And a little bit warmer winter and you have these lower prices for how you're heating your home, that's going to be a real tailwind for consumers.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Definitely.  This is very good news.  And hopefully oil prices stabilize.  We just don't want them to plummet, because remember how low they got in 2008?  </p><p>ROMANS:  For all the wrong reasons.  </p><p>FAROOHOR:  Right, right.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I'm starting to worry we might be having -- </p><p>ROMANS:  That's why we hear politicians promise $2.50 gas we say, no, no, no, the reason you get $2.50 gas is because bad things are happening.  </p><p>Let's talk about cord cutters because this story if for you, folks. HBO and CBS unveiling new subscription Internet services.  The CBS offering, is available immediately, it costs six bucks a month.  HBO's debuts next year.  No word yet on price.  Is this the game changer, Samuel?  </p><p>BURKE:  Netflix was the game changer, but our parent company Time Warner was the first television company to actually pull the cable cord.  This is a game changer.  But what I'm wondering now is if I'm getting Hulu, Netflix, the CBS offering, HBO, is it going to cost as much as cable when it's all said and done?  </p><p>ROMANS:  And what a pain is it going to be?  How many logins am I going to have to know?   FAROOHOR:  And you're going to be able to see what you're being charged for, which is interesting.  And I think that's going to put a lot of pressure on content creators to make you want to pay for it.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  People want it al a carte and they're finally getting it. But what's interesting here is that live sports remains the most coveted form of programming right now because people don't really watch it, usually, on delay.  They're not skipping through ads.  And guess what, no one is offering live streaming, really, of sports in a major way.  </p><p>BURKE:  CBS, and they're not including NFL in this online offering.  </p><p>ROMANS:  The cord cutting thing, sometimes I hear some people say it's totally overstated.  Really, most people, still, are getting their content through their cable subscription.  </p><p>BURKE:  I'm not.  I know I work for the cable news network and I don't have cable like many people in my generation.  </p><p>ROMANS:  This will be his last day.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE:  Don't tell the bosses.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  It's certainly I think of demographics issue.  </p><p>ROMANS:  It is.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  There are lots of older Gen-Xers like me and boomers as well that haven't yet cut the cord.  But we're just getting older and older.</p><p>FAROOHOR:  Last year was a big turning point too.  The cord cutting really sped up.  I think the fact that you have got CBS and HBO and all this, this is a seminal year.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Seminal year, game changer, turning point, cord cutters, good news for you.  </p><p>All right, a new perk that's not without controversy.  Facebook will pay for female employees to freeze their eggs.  Apple reportedly will add that benefit starting in January.  Supporters say this promotes motherhood, this is good for women, this gives them flexibility, this allows them to really focus on their career at a young age and worry about the child rearing later.  Critics say it pressures women to delay child rearing.  This is a big topic of conversation.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS:  I think this is tech changing what we're expecting for our companies and for their coverage.  </p><p>FAROOHOR:  And it's done that in so many ways already.  I think increasing the American work culture is a tech culture.  It's 24/7, people are in cubicles.  I think that in some ways it reflects how male and how hard-driving technology is.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Really?  </p><p>FAROOHOR:  I do.  And you see that the number of female executives are very low in tech.  They're taking three minutes off and get back to work.  I've got to say, it makes me tired, all of it.  </p><p>BURKE:  A lot of the women who were asked about this in the tech industry said one of the reasons they want to freeze their eggs is because they just can't find a husband.  It's not necessarily about work.  It's about finding a good men.  </p><p>ROMANS:  It's not a lack of viable eggs.  It's a lack of viable men.  </p><p>BURKE:  My question is, if you're gay, theoretically, and you know somebody, you're a male in one of these companies and you know a woman's whose eggs you want to use, will the company pay for you to freeze her eggs?  </p><p>ROMANS:  In tech, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody pressed the issue.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think the message here is lean in eventually.  I mean, Cheryl Sandberg, it's all about how she gets out of the office at a normal time so she can go home and spend time with her kids.  </p><p>FAROOHOR:  Who believes that?  Who believes that?  </p><p>ROMANS:  Look, I spoke to a big tech CEO recently who told me that what happens is, women go home, put their kids to bed, make dinner, they come back and work until midnight.  That's the reality.  All right, guys, thanks so much.  Have a great weekend, everybody.  </p><p>And coming up, America's you youngest self-made female billionaire, she left college, Stanford, to start her own company.  What she founded could change health care for millions of Americans.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  America's youngest self-made female billionaire is a college dropout.  Now the company she left school to start is revolutionizing how we draw blood.  Rachel Crane has her story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL CRANE:  At any given time there's about a gallon of blood running through your body, a substance that isn't usually at the forefront of our minds.  But perhaps it should be.  Your blood is one of the best indicators of your health.  </p><p>ELIZABETH HOLMES, FOUNDER AND CEO, THERANOS:  Today people have more access to data about their credit card than they do about their body. The question that we were focused on in starting this company and building this company was, how do we make it a reality for every person to be able to find out the health information that they need or the health information that someone they love needs?  It's far too often when someone you love is really sick you're finding out about it too late.  </p><p>CRANE:  The practice of phlebotomy is over 3,000 years old, but the way we draw and test that blood hasn't really evolved much.  This 30- year-old billionaire is changing that by making it possible to run multiple lab tests on just a single drop of blood.  </p><p>So how do you feel about needles?  </p><p>HOLMES:  I have a major problem with needles.  I really believe that if we were from another planet and we sat down to put our heads together on torture experiments, the concept of sticking a needle into someone and sucking their blood out would probably qualify as a pretty good one.  </p><p>CRANE:  Elizabeth Holmes is a college dropout.  She left Stanford University at 19 to start Theranos.  The company's technology will soon be in every Walgreens in the country.  </p><p>How does this lab compare to the lab you would find at a more traditional laboratory company?  </p><p>HOLMES:  Here we're doing all R and D around our own platform.  So what we've spent the last 10 years doing was test by test redeveloping the chemistry.  </p><p>CRANE:  When you say you've reinvented the chemistry of all of this, what does that mean?  </p><p>HOLMES:  It means you basically have all the chemicals that would be used to process a test in a traditional lab with a large volume of blood, and you have to go reinvent each of those chemicals to be able to work with a small amount of blood.  </p><p>CRANE:  And that's not all Theranos will actually tell you about their technology.  They operate under a culture of secrecy, all the way down to where the real lab sits, several feet below ground.  </p><p>The life-and-death decisions are being made based on these tests that you guys are doing here.  Some of your critics have said not enough review has been done.  </p><p>HOLMES:  We're certified as a high-complexity lab.  And that's the exact same level of regulation and testing and certification that every other lab has.  </p><p>CRANE:  Your company is now evaluated at over $9 billion, making you the youngest self-made billionaire in the world at this point.  How has that changed your life?  </p><p>HOLMES:  You know, it hasn't changed my life at all.  It's a wonderful thing.  But it's not why we're doing this.  And it's not why we're going to be successful as a company.  And we're just getting started.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Changing your relationship with that needle when they draw blood, that is really disrupting.  </p><p>All right, she's got 60 stores around the globe.  Fashion designer Cynthia Rowley tells us how she makes it work next.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Cynthia Rowley is a fashion designer with boutiques around the world, collections sold in top department stores.  But she says these days none of that is necessary.  If you want to be a designer like her, there's never been a better time to do it.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  I'm going to ask her some very serious questions.  Any big surprises on the runways this year?  </p><p>CYNTHIA ROWLEY, FASHION DESIGNER:  Well, people are talking about a little bit of a mod feeling on the runways.  </p><p>ROMANS:  This is a little bit mod.  </p><p>ROWLEY:  You know, this is a little bit mod.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Can I just try this on?  </p><p>ROWLEY:  Yes.  </p><p>As a brand, we're kind of known for these graphic prints and mixing sporty with pretty.  You know, I like the idea of putting great design in everyday necessities.  This is function and fashion together.  Go jump on a city bike.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS:  What advice do you give a young designer?  </p><p>ROWLEY:  It's such a great time for making your product accessible to tons and tons of people and getting the word out and telling your story.  It's never been better.  You know, it used to be you needed to invest, you know, so much in a start-up.  Now it's like you can have an idea.  You put it out there, and it's OK if it's small.  </p><p>ROMANS:  You always were pretty and sporty.  Now you've taken sporty and have sporty on its own.  </p><p>ROWLEY:  So that's all here.  And fully functional, like the wetsuit.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Do you think this is a growth area?  </p><p>ROWLEY:  Most definitely.  Every single industry from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to the New York fashion world, people don't really dress up.  If you feel like you look good and you're excited about what you're wearing, you're going to perform better.  You're going to have more fun.  You're maybe going to do things and try things that you've never done before.  </p><p>ROMANS:  The track pants and t-shirt.  </p><p>ROWLEY:  Well, I still like a Budweiser t-shirt.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS:  Where does Cynthia Rowley fall on the lean-in, lean-back spectrum?  Two kids, a big business?  </p><p>ROWLEY:  Is there a bungee jump version?  I still work really hard.  </p><p>ROMANS:  You like to work really hard, don't you?  </p><p>ROWLEY:  That's the thing.  The reality is I really like what I do. And it's really fun.  And it's really exciting.  So it's not like work.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  I love that, Lean in or bungee jump in.  </p><p>Thanks for watching CNN MONEY.  Check us out on the web, CNNmoney.com.

Can the missteps be fixed before Ebola punishes the global economy? I'm Christine Romans.

Is Ebola's economic toll just beginning?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Dr. Joseph McCormick is a professor and regional dean of the University of Texas, School of Public Health. He worked at the CDC in 1976 when it investigated the first Ebola epidemic in central Africa. Thank you so much for joining me, Dr. McCormick. I want to ask you point-blank, is this a lack of funding for hospital preparedness, or is this just a culture that we're not ready here, yet, to deal with this?</p><p>DR. JOSEPH MCCORMICK, REGIONAL DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Christine, I think this is an issue of culture and preparedness and far less about funding. Let me give you an example. I think that in terms of hospital infections, the United States has one of the lowest levels of hospital infection rates in the world among developed countries. And yet -- and I think what happened was, many people thought was, OK, we have a great job with hospital infections. We're ready for handing Ebola. I think that may be part of the issue at Presbyterian. And unfortunately handling a viral illness like this is totally different. And I think that may have played a role.</p><p>Although there are plenty of people who say we still have too many hospital infections, we still don't do a good enough job of just washing hands for doctors and nurses. That's still, you know, I think we saw 99,000 people get have a health care-acquired infection every year. But this is Ebola. This is different. This is something that has to be handled very carefully and appropriately, immediately. There can be no mistakes. The two nurses infected in Dallas have been moved to a specialized bio-containment unit, one in Georgia, one in Maryland. There are some four facilities like this in the country. Do we need to scale up on that?</p><p>MCCORMICK: I don't think so, because I think what that means is, we're trying to replace good old-fashioned competence and training with technology, and I don't think that's going to work.</p><p>ROMANS: So competence and training, what do we need to do, then? If we don't need to spend more money or build more bio-containment units, is this -- clearly webinars and websites with protocol isn't working.</p><p>MCCORMICK: Yes, we have to first of all have the correct protocol, and it wasn't there. Secondly, this is the kind of training that means hands-on, and it means that the health care workers have to buy- in to the protocol. It's not enough to give a webinar or a YouTube video. You simply have to have boots on the ground training. It has to be a group, in my opinion, that is dedicated to this and they're going to be the go-to group wherever there's a suspect case. You have to have a protocol ready for when somebody walks in the door of your emergency room all the way to the time when you're finished.</p><p>ROMANS: Really interesting. Dr. McCormick, so nice to see you. Dr. Joseph McCormick, interesting that it's not necessarily just more money that's needed, but we need to change the culture and have different training, not necessarily more technology. Thank you, sir, for joining us.</p><p>I want to bring in CNN MONEY's Cristina Alesci. She joins me now. You know, let's talk about the cost of this, let's talk about the response to the Ebola crisis in Africa in particular. Private donors are starting to step in here. Interesting. Tell me about that. CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Starting. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as Mark Zuckerberg pledged to this effort $50 million from Bill and Melinda Gates alone, $25 million from Mark Zuckerberg. Some of that is going to aid organizations. Some of it's going to actually the U.S. government organizations and units like the CDC. Now, private sector donations are not enough, clearly. The U.N. said that it needs about $1 billion in a fund to go ahead and get ahead of the curve.</p><p>ROMANS: We are not there.</p><p>ALESCI: We are totally not there. You're talking about $20 million in pledges, and the fund itself only has $100,000 in cash. Now clearly there's money going to other organizations, but the U.N., it's clearly indicative of a shortfall.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's talk about the industries affected. Interesting that the chocolate industry is actually affected by Ebola because it operates in these countries. It's a $67 billion business, 26 global companies collectively donating $600,000. Wait a minute. Look at the profit number, look at the revenue number, look at what they're donating. Could they do more?</p><p>ALESCI: Absolutely they could do more. And 70 percent of the world's supply of cocoa beans actually comes from West Africa. So you would think, if anybody has skin in the game, these guys have skin in the game.</p><p>Now, granted, the high-producing countries are not the ones that are actually affected, but they are neighboring them, like the Ivory Coast right next door to Liberia. So you would think that the chocolate companies would want to protect themselves.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>ALESCI: In fact, Ivory Coast is so exposed that the CDC is actually sending staff down there to test its preparedness. So it may not be in the country, but people are concerned that it could spread there. And look, you talk about $10 billion in profits. Mars alone, one of the biggest manufacturers of chocolate, number one in market share, only gave $100,000.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow. That is interesting and maybe a little bit of a wake-up call for corporate responsibility. Thank you so much, Cristina Alesci. Have a great weekend.</p><p>Coming up, another week and another wild ride on Wall Street. Why you should not panic, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: So, you know, October has a pretty bad wrap when it comes to the stock market, and so far this month it's living up to its bad reputation. That lead our CNN MONEY top four this week. Our CNN MONEY panel is here, Paul La Monica, Rana Foroohar, and Samuel Burke. OK, guys, another volatile week on Wall Street. We're talking about 400-point swing on the Dow. Paul, is there more selling or are there bargains here?</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: I think there are definitely bargains going forward, but that doesn't mean that the worst is over. We could still have another steep sell-off because a lot of people are worried about Europe's economy. Ebola's a big wild card. But there are quality companies trading for a lot less money than they used to that have probably been oversold.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: I agree. Now, I think that the U.S. is still in some ways the prettiest house on the ugly block, right? It doesn't feel that great here, but if you look at Europe about ready to tip into recession, Asia is slowing down, China is really having a debt crisis of its own right now, I think that we're going to see a lot more volatility, but I think that people will have a few better places to park their money ultimately than U.S. equities.</p><p>ROMANS: Every time we've had to have a pullback in the last two years of 10 percent, we haven't had it in the S&amp;P 500. The NASDAQ had a full 10 percent correction and bounced right back, Samuel.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, TECH BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: And there are lots of opportunities just because of what you're saying. For instance, I was covering Netflix and Google this week. Netflix down 26 percent. But just a few hours later back up seven percent. Wish I would have gone in. Google down five percent at one point, an hour later, back up four percent.</p><p>ROMANS: But raise your hand, we shouldn't be surprised the market is going down. It's not unpredictable here. All of these factors are well known. So does the fed do anything or does the Fed really get out of --</p><p>LA MONICA: I hope not.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I hope not too.</p><p>LA MONICA: The rally that we saw on Thursday at the end of the day, a lot of it was due to one Fed member hinting that maybe QE lasts a little bit longer.</p><p>ROMANS: And a decent jobs number. So you look at the internals of the American economy, it's not doing so bad.</p><p>LA MONICA: The Fed should act if the economy is weakening, don't you think?</p><p>FAROOHOR: Absolutely. They've already put $4 trillion into the economy since the financial crisis. We know that's created some bubbles. And you know, we know that it's not doing much more for the real economy to put more money in it.</p><p>ROMANS: Lots for us to talk about, lots for us to watch. If stocks are dropping, so are oil prices. Oil down 25 percent from the peak this summer. I think it's fair to say oil prices have plunged since June. The national average for a gallon of regular gas down more than 20 cents in the last four weeks. And Gas Buddy tells us that parts of the western U.S. and the Rocky Mountain states could see another drop of 15 to 30 cents a gallon. The Energy Department says heating bills will also be lower this year. What's driving this decline? Is it only production in the U.S. up and worries about global demand?</p><p>FAROOHOR: It's two things. Production in the U.S. is up because of the shale boom, but also, China is slowing down. That's a big part of this. For the last year China has been the single largest energy consumer in the world. When they slow down, the price of oil drops.</p><p>BURKE: For every one cent that gas drops in the United States, that's $1.4 billion that Americans have to spend on something else. And that's coming right --</p><p>ROMANS: It's like a tax cut.</p><p>BURKE: Exactly. That's even better than the last one for most people. And this is coming right before the big holiday buying season. So people might have even more to spend, could be good for consumers.</p><p>ROMANS: And a little bit warmer winter and you have these lower prices for how you're heating your home, that's going to be a real tailwind for consumers.</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. This is very good news. And hopefully oil prices stabilize. We just don't want them to plummet, because remember how low they got in 2008?</p><p>ROMANS: For all the wrong reasons.</p><p>FAROOHOR: Right, right.</p><p>LA MONICA: I'm starting to worry we might be having --</p><p>ROMANS: That's why we hear politicians promise $2.50 gas we say, no, no, no, the reason you get $2.50 gas is because bad things are happening.</p><p>Let's talk about cord cutters because this story if for you, folks. HBO and CBS unveiling new subscription Internet services. The CBS offering, is available immediately, it costs six bucks a month. HBO's debuts next year. No word yet on price. Is this the game changer, Samuel?</p><p>BURKE: Netflix was the game changer, but our parent company Time Warner was the first television company to actually pull the cable cord. This is a game changer. But what I'm wondering now is if I'm getting Hulu, Netflix, the CBS offering, HBO, is it going to cost as much as cable when it's all said and done?</p><p>ROMANS: And what a pain is it going to be? How many logins am I going to have to know? FAROOHOR: And you're going to be able to see what you're being charged for, which is interesting. And I think that's going to put a lot of pressure on content creators to make you want to pay for it.</p><p>LA MONICA: People want it al a carte and they're finally getting it. But what's interesting here is that live sports remains the most coveted form of programming right now because people don't really watch it, usually, on delay. They're not skipping through ads. And guess what, no one is offering live streaming, really, of sports in a major way.</p><p>BURKE: CBS, and they're not including NFL in this online offering.</p><p>ROMANS: The cord cutting thing, sometimes I hear some people say it's totally overstated. Really, most people, still, are getting their content through their cable subscription.</p><p>BURKE: I'm not. I know I work for the cable news network and I don't have cable like many people in my generation.</p><p>ROMANS: This will be his last day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE: Don't tell the bosses.</p><p>LA MONICA: It's certainly I think of demographics issue.</p><p>ROMANS: It is.</p><p>LA MONICA: There are lots of older Gen-Xers like me and boomers as well that haven't yet cut the cord. But we're just getting older and older.</p><p>FAROOHOR: Last year was a big turning point too. The cord cutting really sped up. I think the fact that you have got CBS and HBO and all this, this is a seminal year.</p><p>ROMANS: Seminal year, game changer, turning point, cord cutters, good news for you.</p><p>All right, a new perk that's not without controversy. Facebook will pay for female employees to freeze their eggs. Apple reportedly will add that benefit starting in January. Supporters say this promotes motherhood, this is good for women, this gives them flexibility, this allows them to really focus on their career at a young age and worry about the child rearing later. Critics say it pressures women to delay child rearing. This is a big topic of conversation.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: I think this is tech changing what we're expecting for our companies and for their coverage.</p><p>FAROOHOR: And it's done that in so many ways already. I think increasing the American work culture is a tech culture. It's 24/7, people are in cubicles. I think that in some ways it reflects how male and how hard-driving technology is.</p><p>ROMANS: Really?</p><p>FAROOHOR: I do. And you see that the number of female executives are very low in tech. They're taking three minutes off and get back to work. I've got to say, it makes me tired, all of it.</p><p>BURKE: A lot of the women who were asked about this in the tech industry said one of the reasons they want to freeze their eggs is because they just can't find a husband. It's not necessarily about work. It's about finding a good men.</p><p>ROMANS: It's not a lack of viable eggs. It's a lack of viable men.</p><p>BURKE: My question is, if you're gay, theoretically, and you know somebody, you're a male in one of these companies and you know a woman's whose eggs you want to use, will the company pay for you to freeze her eggs?</p><p>ROMANS: In tech, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody pressed the issue.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think the message here is lean in eventually. I mean, Cheryl Sandberg, it's all about how she gets out of the office at a normal time so she can go home and spend time with her kids.</p><p>FAROOHOR: Who believes that? Who believes that?</p><p>ROMANS: Look, I spoke to a big tech CEO recently who told me that what happens is, women go home, put their kids to bed, make dinner, they come back and work until midnight. That's the reality. All right, guys, thanks so much. Have a great weekend, everybody.</p><p>And coming up, America's you youngest self-made female billionaire, she left college, Stanford, to start her own company. What she founded could change health care for millions of Americans.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: America's youngest self-made female billionaire is a college dropout. Now the company she left school to start is revolutionizing how we draw blood. Rachel Crane has her story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL CRANE: At any given time there's about a gallon of blood running through your body, a substance that isn't usually at the forefront of our minds. But perhaps it should be. Your blood is one of the best indicators of your health.</p><p>ELIZABETH HOLMES, FOUNDER AND CEO, THERANOS: Today people have more access to data about their credit card than they do about their body. The question that we were focused on in starting this company and building this company was, how do we make it a reality for every person to be able to find out the health information that they need or the health information that someone they love needs? It's far too often when someone you love is really sick you're finding out about it too late.</p><p>CRANE: The practice of phlebotomy is over 3,000 years old, but the way we draw and test that blood hasn't really evolved much. This 30- year-old billionaire is changing that by making it possible to run multiple lab tests on just a single drop of blood.</p><p>So how do you feel about needles?</p><p>HOLMES: I have a major problem with needles. I really believe that if we were from another planet and we sat down to put our heads together on torture experiments, the concept of sticking a needle into someone and sucking their blood out would probably qualify as a pretty good one.</p><p>CRANE: Elizabeth Holmes is a college dropout. She left Stanford University at 19 to start Theranos. The company's technology will soon be in every Walgreens in the country.</p><p>How does this lab compare to the lab you would find at a more traditional laboratory company?</p><p>HOLMES: Here we're doing all R and D around our own platform. So what we've spent the last 10 years doing was test by test redeveloping the chemistry.</p><p>CRANE: When you say you've reinvented the chemistry of all of this, what does that mean?</p><p>HOLMES: It means you basically have all the chemicals that would be used to process a test in a traditional lab with a large volume of blood, and you have to go reinvent each of those chemicals to be able to work with a small amount of blood.</p><p>CRANE: And that's not all Theranos will actually tell you about their technology. They operate under a culture of secrecy, all the way down to where the real lab sits, several feet below ground.</p><p>The life-and-death decisions are being made based on these tests that you guys are doing here. Some of your critics have said not enough review has been done.</p><p>HOLMES: We're certified as a high-complexity lab. And that's the exact same level of regulation and testing and certification that every other lab has.</p><p>CRANE: Your company is now evaluated at over $9 billion, making you the youngest self-made billionaire in the world at this point. How has that changed your life?</p><p>HOLMES: You know, it hasn't changed my life at all. It's a wonderful thing. But it's not why we're doing this. And it's not why we're going to be successful as a company. And we're just getting started.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Changing your relationship with that needle when they draw blood, that is really disrupting.</p><p>All right, she's got 60 stores around the globe. Fashion designer Cynthia Rowley tells us how she makes it work next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: Cynthia Rowley is a fashion designer with boutiques around the world, collections sold in top department stores. But she says these days none of that is necessary. If you want to be a designer like her, there's never been a better time to do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: I'm going to ask her some very serious questions. Any big surprises on the runways this year?</p><p>CYNTHIA ROWLEY, FASHION DESIGNER: Well, people are talking about a little bit of a mod feeling on the runways.</p><p>ROMANS: This is a little bit mod.</p><p>ROWLEY: You know, this is a little bit mod.</p><p>ROMANS: Can I just try this on?</p><p>ROWLEY: Yes.</p><p>As a brand, we're kind of known for these graphic prints and mixing sporty with pretty. You know, I like the idea of putting great design in everyday necessities. This is function and fashion together. Go jump on a city bike.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: What advice do you give a young designer?</p><p>ROWLEY: It's such a great time for making your product accessible to tons and tons of people and getting the word out and telling your story. It's never been better. You know, it used to be you needed to invest, you know, so much in a start-up. Now it's like you can have an idea. You put it out there, and it's OK if it's small.</p><p>ROMANS: You always were pretty and sporty. Now you've taken sporty and have sporty on its own.</p><p>ROWLEY: So that's all here. And fully functional, like the wetsuit.</p><p>ROMANS: Do you think this is a growth area?</p><p>ROWLEY: Most definitely. Every single industry from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to the New York fashion world, people don't really dress up. If you feel like you look good and you're excited about what you're wearing, you're going to perform better. You're going to have more fun. You're maybe going to do things and try things that you've never done before.</p><p>ROMANS: The track pants and t-shirt.</p><p>ROWLEY: Well, I still like a Budweiser t-shirt.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: Where does Cynthia Rowley fall on the lean-in, lean-back spectrum? Two kids, a big business?</p><p>ROWLEY: Is there a bungee jump version? I still work really hard.</p><p>ROMANS: You like to work really hard, don't you?</p><p>ROWLEY: That's the thing. The reality is I really like what I do. And it's really fun. And it's really exciting. So it's not like work.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: I love that, Lean in or bungee jump in.</p><p>Thanks for watching CNN MONEY. Check us out on the web, CNNmoney.com.

Can the missteps be fixed before Ebola punishes the global economy? I'm Christine Romans. This is \"CNN MONEY.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS: Ebola exposing cracks in the world's most expensive health care system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Something went wrong in that hospital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS: A second health care worker infected with Ebola. Nurses saying they aren't getting the training they need.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stop pointing fingers and fix the problem.</p><p>ROMANS: Is it a question of resources? Federal funding for hospital preparedness has been cut in half since 2003, some members of Congress calling for millions more to be spent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today it's Ebola. Tomorrow it will be something else unless we make the right investments.</p><p>ROMANS: The president says there will be no outbreak in America.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The dangers of a serious outbreak are extraordinarily low.</p><p>ROMANS: That as the epidemic in West Africa spreads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will go over 9,000 cases this week.</p><p>ROMANS: Private donors are stepping up, but as fear grows so will the financial damage. Is Ebola's economic toll just beginning?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Dr. Joseph McCormick is a professor and regional dean of the University of Texas, School of Public Health. He worked at the CDC in 1976 when it investigated the first Ebola epidemic in central Africa. Thank you so much for joining me, Dr. McCormick. I want to ask you point-blank, is this a lack of funding for hospital preparedness, or is this just a culture that we're not ready here, yet, to deal with this?</p><p>DR. JOSEPH MCCORMICK, REGIONAL DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Christine, I think this is an issue of culture and preparedness and far less about funding. Let me give you an example. I think that in terms of hospital infections, the United States has one of the lowest levels of hospital infection rates in the world among developed countries. And yet -- and I think what happened was, many people thought was, OK, we have a great job with hospital infections. We're ready for handing Ebola. I think that may be part of the issue at Presbyterian. And unfortunately handling a viral illness like this is totally different. And I think that may have played a role.</p><p>Although there are plenty of people who say we still have too many hospital infections, we still don't do a good enough job of just washing hands for doctors and nurses. That's still, you know, I think we saw 99,000 people get have a health care-acquired infection every year. But this is Ebola. This is different. This is something that has to be handled very carefully and appropriately, immediately. There can be no mistakes. The two nurses infected in Dallas have been moved to a specialized bio-containment unit, one in Georgia, one in Maryland. There are some four facilities like this in the country. Do we need to scale up on that?</p><p>MCCORMICK: I don't think so, because I think what that means is, we're trying to replace good old-fashioned competence and training with technology, and I don't think that's going to work.</p><p>ROMANS: So competence and training, what do we need to do, then? If we don't need to spend more money or build more bio-containment units, is this -- clearly webinars and websites with protocol isn't working.</p><p>MCCORMICK: Yes, we have to first of all have the correct protocol, and it wasn't there. Secondly, this is the kind of training that means hands-on, and it means that the health care workers have to buy- in to the protocol. It's not enough to give a webinar or a YouTube video. You simply have to have boots on the ground training. It has to be a group, in my opinion, that is dedicated to this and they're going to be the go-to group wherever there's a suspect case. You have to have a protocol ready for when somebody walks in the door of your emergency room all the way to the time when you're finished.</p><p>ROMANS: Really interesting. Dr. McCormick, so nice to see you. Dr. Joseph McCormick, interesting that it's not necessarily just more money that's needed, but we need to change the culture and have different training, not necessarily more technology. Thank you, sir, for joining us.</p><p>I want to bring in CNN MONEY's Cristina Alesci. She joins me now. You know, let's talk about the cost of this, let's talk about the response to the Ebola crisis in Africa in particular. Private donors are starting to step in here. Interesting. Tell me about that. CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Starting. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as Mark Zuckerberg pledged to this effort $50 million from Bill and Melinda Gates alone, $25 million from Mark Zuckerberg. Some of that is going to aid organizations. Some of it's going to actually the U.S. government organizations and units like the CDC. Now, private sector donations are not enough, clearly. The U.N. said that it needs about $1 billion in a fund to go ahead and get ahead of the curve.</p><p>ROMANS: We are not there.</p><p>ALESCI: We are totally not there. You're talking about $20 million in pledges, and the fund itself only has $100,000 in cash. Now clearly there's money going to other organizations, but the U.N., it's clearly indicative of a shortfall.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's talk about the industries affected. Interesting that the chocolate industry is actually affected by Ebola because it operates in these countries. It's a $67 billion business, 26 global companies collectively donating $600,000. Wait a minute. Look at the profit number, look at the revenue number, look at what they're donating. Could they do more?</p><p>ALESCI: Absolutely they could do more. And 70 percent of the world's supply of cocoa beans actually comes from West Africa. So you would think, if anybody has skin in the game, these guys have skin in the game.</p><p>Now, granted, the high-producing countries are not the ones that are actually affected, but they are neighboring them, like the Ivory Coast right next door to Liberia. So you would think that the chocolate companies would want to protect themselves.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>ALESCI: In fact, Ivory Coast is so exposed that the CDC is actually sending staff down there to test its preparedness. So it may not be in the country, but people are concerned that it could spread there. And look, you talk about $10 billion in profits. Mars alone, one of the biggest manufacturers of chocolate, number one in market share, only gave $100,000.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow. That is interesting and maybe a little bit of a wake-up call for corporate responsibility. Thank you so much, Cristina Alesci. Have a great weekend.</p><p>Coming up, another week and another wild ride on Wall Street. Why you should not panic, next.</p><p>ROMANS: So, you know, October has a pretty bad wrap when it comes to the stock market, and so far this month it's living up to its bad reputation. That lead our CNN MONEY top four this week. Our CNN MONEY panel is here, Paul La Monica, Rana Foroohar, and Samuel Burke. OK, guys, another volatile week on Wall Street. We're talking about 400-point swing on the Dow. Paul, is there more selling or are there bargains here?</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: I think there are definitely bargains going forward, but that doesn't mean that the worst is over. We could still have another steep sell-off because a lot of people are worried about Europe's economy. Ebola's a big wild card. But there are quality companies trading for a lot less money than they used to that have probably been oversold.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: I agree. Now, I think that the U.S. is still in some ways the prettiest house on the ugly block, right? It doesn't feel that great here, but if you look at Europe about ready to tip into recession, Asia is slowing down, China is really having a debt crisis of its own right now, I think that we're going to see a lot more volatility, but I think that people will have a few better places to park their money ultimately than U.S. equities.</p><p>ROMANS: Every time we've had to have a pullback in the last two years of 10 percent, we haven't had it in the S&amp;P 500. The NASDAQ had a full 10 percent correction and bounced right back, Samuel.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, TECH BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: And there are lots of opportunities just because of what you're saying. For instance, I was covering Netflix and Google this week. Netflix down 26 percent. But just a few hours later back up seven percent. Wish I would have gone in. Google down five percent at one point, an hour later, back up four percent.</p><p>ROMANS: But raise your hand, we shouldn't be surprised the market is going down. It's not unpredictable here. All of these factors are well known. So does the fed do anything or does the Fed really get out of --</p><p>LA MONICA: I hope not.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I hope not too.</p><p>LA MONICA: The rally that we saw on Thursday at the end of the day, a lot of it was due to one Fed member hinting that maybe QE lasts a little bit longer.</p><p>ROMANS: And a decent jobs number. So you look at the internals of the American economy, it's not doing so bad.</p><p>LA MONICA: The Fed should act if the economy is weakening, don't you think?</p><p>FAROOHOR: Absolutely. They've already put $4 trillion into the economy since the financial crisis. We know that's created some bubbles. And you know, we know that it's not doing much more for the real economy to put more money in it.</p><p>ROMANS: Lots for us to talk about, lots for us to watch. If stocks are dropping, so are oil prices. Oil down 25 percent from the peak this summer. I think it's fair to say oil prices have plunged since June. The national average for a gallon of regular gas down more than 20 cents in the last four weeks. And Gas Buddy tells us that parts of the western U.S. and the Rocky Mountain states could see another drop of 15 to 30 cents a gallon. The Energy Department says heating bills will also be lower this year. What's driving this decline? Is it only production in the U.S. up and worries about global demand?</p><p>FAROOHOR: It's two things. Production in the U.S. is up because of the shale boom, but also, China is slowing down. That's a big part of this. For the last year China has been the single largest energy consumer in the world. When they slow down, the price of oil drops.</p><p>BURKE: For every one cent that gas drops in the United States, that's $1.4 billion that Americans have to spend on something else. And that's coming right --</p><p>ROMANS: It's like a tax cut.</p><p>BURKE: Exactly. That's even better than the last one for most people. And this is coming right before the big holiday buying season. So people might have even more to spend, could be good for consumers.</p><p>ROMANS: And a little bit warmer winter and you have these lower prices for how you're heating your home, that's going to be a real tailwind for consumers.</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. This is very good news. And hopefully oil prices stabilize. We just don't want them to plummet, because remember how low they got in 2008?</p><p>ROMANS: For all the wrong reasons.</p><p>FAROOHOR: Right, right.</p><p>LA MONICA: I'm starting to worry we might be having --</p><p>ROMANS: That's why we hear politicians promise $2.50 gas we say, no, no, no, the reason you get $2.50 gas is because bad things are happening.</p><p>Let's talk about cord cutters because this story if for you, folks. HBO and CBS unveiling new subscription Internet services. The CBS offering, is available immediately, it costs six bucks a month. HBO's debuts next year. No word yet on price. Is this the game changer, Samuel?</p><p>BURKE: Netflix was the game changer, but our parent company Time Warner was the first television company to actually pull the cable cord. This is a game changer. But what I'm wondering now is if I'm getting Hulu, Netflix, the CBS offering, HBO, is it going to cost as much as cable when it's all said and done?</p><p>ROMANS: And what a pain is it going to be? How many logins am I going to have to know? FAROOHOR: And you're going to be able to see what you're being charged for, which is interesting. And I think that's going to put a lot of pressure on content creators to make you want to pay for it.</p><p>LA MONICA: People want it al a carte and they're finally getting it. But what's interesting here is that live sports remains the most coveted form of programming right now because people don't really watch it, usually, on delay. They're not skipping through ads. And guess what, no one is offering live streaming, really, of sports in a major way.</p><p>BURKE: CBS, and they're not including NFL in this online offering.</p><p>ROMANS: The cord cutting thing, sometimes I hear some people say it's totally overstated. Really, most people, still, are getting their content through their cable subscription.</p><p>BURKE: I'm not. I know I work for the cable news network and I don't have cable like many people in my generation.</p><p>ROMANS: This will be his last day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE: Don't tell the bosses.</p><p>LA MONICA: It's certainly I think of demographics issue.</p><p>ROMANS: It is.</p><p>LA MONICA: There are lots of older Gen-Xers like me and boomers as well that haven't yet cut the cord. But we're just getting older and older.</p><p>FAROOHOR: Last year was a big turning point too. The cord cutting really sped up. I think the fact that you have got CBS and HBO and all this, this is a seminal year.</p><p>ROMANS: Seminal year, game changer, turning point, cord cutters, good news for you.</p><p>All right, a new perk that's not without controversy. Facebook will pay for female employees to freeze their eggs. Apple reportedly will add that benefit starting in January. Supporters say this promotes motherhood, this is good for women, this gives them flexibility, this allows them to really focus on their career at a young age and worry about the child rearing later. Critics say it pressures women to delay child rearing. This is a big topic of conversation.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: I think this is tech changing what we're expecting for our companies and for their coverage.</p><p>FAROOHOR: And it's done that in so many ways already. I think increasing the American work culture is a tech culture. It's 24/7, people are in cubicles. I think that in some ways it reflects how male and how hard-driving technology is.</p><p>ROMANS: Really?</p><p>FAROOHOR: I do. And you see that the number of female executives are very low in tech. They're taking three minutes off and get back to work. I've got to say, it makes me tired, all of it.</p><p>BURKE: A lot of the women who were asked about this in the tech industry said one of the reasons they want to freeze their eggs is because they just can't find a husband. It's not necessarily about work. It's about finding a good men.</p><p>ROMANS: It's not a lack of viable eggs. It's a lack of viable men.</p><p>BURKE: My question is, if you're gay, theoretically, and you know somebody, you're a male in one of these companies and you know a woman's whose eggs you want to use, will the company pay for you to freeze her eggs?</p><p>ROMANS: In tech, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody pressed the issue.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think the message here is lean in eventually. I mean, Cheryl Sandberg, it's all about how she gets out of the office at a normal time so she can go home and spend time with her kids.</p><p>FAROOHOR: Who believes that? Who believes that?</p><p>ROMANS: Look, I spoke to a big tech CEO recently who told me that what happens is, women go home, put their kids to bed, make dinner, they come back and work until midnight. That's the reality. All right, guys, thanks so much. Have a great weekend, everybody.</p><p>And coming up, America's you youngest self-made female billionaire, she left college, Stanford, to start her own company. What she founded could change health care for millions of Americans.</p><p>ROMANS: America's youngest self-made female billionaire is a college dropout. Now the company she left school to start is revolutionizing how we draw blood. Rachel Crane has her story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL CRANE: At any given time there's about a gallon of blood running through your body, a substance that isn't usually at the forefront of our minds. But perhaps it should be. Your blood is one of the best indicators of your health.</p><p>ELIZABETH HOLMES, FOUNDER AND CEO, THERANOS: Today people have more access to data about their credit card than they do about their body. The question that we were focused on in starting this company and building this company was, how do we make it a reality for every person to be able to find out the health information that they need or the health information that someone they love needs? It's far too often when someone you love is really sick you're finding out about it too late.</p><p>CRANE: The practice of phlebotomy is over 3,000 years old, but the way we draw and test that blood hasn't really evolved much. This 30- year-old billionaire is changing that by making it possible to run multiple lab tests on just a single drop of blood.</p><p>So how do you feel about needles?</p><p>HOLMES: I have a major problem with needles. I really believe that if we were from another planet and we sat down to put our heads together on torture experiments, the concept of sticking a needle into someone and sucking their blood out would probably qualify as a pretty good one.</p><p>CRANE: Elizabeth Holmes is a college dropout. She left Stanford University at 19 to start Theranos. The company's technology will soon be in every Walgreens in the country.</p><p>How does this lab compare to the lab you would find at a more traditional laboratory company?</p><p>HOLMES: Here we're doing all R and D around our own platform. So what we've spent the last 10 years doing was test by test redeveloping the chemistry.</p><p>CRANE: When you say you've reinvented the chemistry of all of this, what does that mean?</p><p>HOLMES: It means you basically have all the chemicals that would be used to process a test in a traditional lab with a large volume of blood, and you have to go reinvent each of those chemicals to be able to work with a small amount of blood.</p><p>CRANE: And that's not all Theranos will actually tell you about their technology. They operate under a culture of secrecy, all the way down to where the real lab sits, several feet below ground.</p><p>The life-and-death decisions are being made based on these tests that you guys are doing here. Some of your critics have said not enough review has been done.</p><p>HOLMES: We're certified as a high-complexity lab. And that's the exact same level of regulation and testing and certification that every other lab has.</p><p>CRANE: Your company is now evaluated at over $9 billion, making you the youngest self-made billionaire in the world at this point. How has that changed your life?</p><p>HOLMES: You know, it hasn't changed my life at all. It's a wonderful thing. But it's not why we're doing this. And it's not why we're going to be successful as a company. And we're just getting started.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Changing your relationship with that needle when they draw blood, that is really disrupting.</p><p>All right, she's got 60 stores around the globe. Fashion designer Cynthia Rowley tells us how she makes it work next.</p><p>ROMANS: Cynthia Rowley is a fashion designer with boutiques around the world, collections sold in top department stores. But she says these days none of that is necessary. If you want to be a designer like her, there's never been a better time to do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: I'm going to ask her some very serious questions. Any big surprises on the runways this year?</p><p>CYNTHIA ROWLEY, FASHION DESIGNER: Well, people are talking about a little bit of a mod feeling on the runways.</p><p>ROMANS: This is a little bit mod.</p><p>ROWLEY: You know, this is a little bit mod.</p><p>ROMANS: Can I just try this on?</p><p>ROWLEY: Yes.</p><p>As a brand, we're kind of known for these graphic prints and mixing sporty with pretty. You know, I like the idea of putting great design in everyday necessities. This is function and fashion together. Go jump on a city bike.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: What advice do you give a young designer?</p><p>ROWLEY: It's such a great time for making your product accessible to tons and tons of people and getting the word out and telling your story. It's never been better. You know, it used to be you needed to invest, you know, so much in a start-up. Now it's like you can have an idea. You put it out there, and it's OK if it's small.</p><p>ROMANS: You always were pretty and sporty. Now you've taken sporty and have sporty on its own.</p><p>ROWLEY: So that's all here. And fully functional, like the wetsuit.</p><p>ROMANS: Do you think this is a growth area?</p><p>ROWLEY: Most definitely. Every single industry from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to the New York fashion world, people don't really dress up. If you feel like you look good and you're excited about what you're wearing, you're going to perform better. You're going to have more fun. You're maybe going to do things and try things that you've never done before.</p><p>ROMANS: The track pants and t-shirt.</p><p>ROWLEY: Well, I still like a Budweiser t-shirt.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROMANS: Where does Cynthia Rowley fall on the lean-in, lean-back spectrum? Two kids, a big business?</p><p>ROWLEY: Is there a bungee jump version? I still work really hard.</p><p>ROMANS: You like to work really hard, don't you?</p><p>ROWLEY: That's the thing. The reality is I really like what I do. And it's really fun. And it's really exciting. So it's not like work.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: I love that, Lean in or bungee jump in.</p><p>Thanks for watching CNN MONEY. Check us out on the web, CNNmoney.com.

Markets snapped the two-day gaining streak with Sensex and Nifty slipping below their crucial 33,000 and 10,150 levels, respectively. Markets started the session on a pessimistic note as traders remained concerned with report that Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections slid for the second straight month to Rs 851.74 billion in February as only 69 per cent of the assessees filed returns. Around 5.951 million GSTR 3B returns were filed for the month of February till March 25. Sentiments on the street weakened further with a private report stating that weak macroeconomic indicators like current account deficit and inflation have exposed India to adverse global macro developments such as US monetary policy trajectory and trade war risks. Expiry of futures and options contracts for the month of March and profit booking on the last trading day for the current financial year 2017-18 before the long term capital gains tax (LTCG) kicks in from April 2, 2018 are the other factors that weighed on the sentiments. </p><p>Traders failed to take any sense of relief with Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian's statement that he wanted a simpler GST structure. He also said that once the GST Council is confident that the revenue through indirect tax is stabilising, it will do more simplification future.</p><p>On the global front, Asian markets ended lower, as tech stocks extended losses following sell-offs of their U.S. peers overnight.

However, it expects recovery in revenues and profitability of telecom sector by end of financial year 2018-19 (FY2019) and is also expecting reduction in the industry debt levels to Rs 4.3 lakh crore by FY2019 from the estimation of Rs 4.7 lakh crore as on March 31, 2018, on the back of asset monetisation and increased promoter support.  <br/><br/></p><p>Besides, on the long term basis, ICRA expects recovery in the sector, on the back of a consolidated structure, better pricing power and data usage with greater price-inelasticity.

Japanese stocks fell, led by a sell-off in tech firms after their US counterparts skidded on concerns about government regulation, while ex-dividend trades added to the broader losses. Further, Chinese stocks closed lower, led by declines in the foreign trade sector. Stocks related to foreign trade dropped following the US government's latest tariff plan on imports from China.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">AsianIndices</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Last Trade            </entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Change in Points</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Change in %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Shanghai Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3,122.29</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-44.36</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.40</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hang Seng</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30,022.53</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-768.30</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-2.50</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jakarta Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6,140.84</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-68.51</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.10</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">KLSE Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,857.87</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-4.58</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-0.25</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Nikkei 225</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">21,031.31</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-286.01</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.34</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Straits Times</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3,382.78</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-56.57</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.64</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">KOSPI Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,419.29</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-32.77</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.34</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Taiwan Weighted</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10,865.66</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-121.13</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.10</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>DISCLAIMER: Accord Fintech provides the Content on \"AS IS\" basis without any express or implied warranties.

Key indices have made a cautious start and traded marginally in red, as traders remain worried with a private report that the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. The three-month pre-monsoon season March, April and May ended with a rainfall deficiency of 25%. As per the report, all the four meteorological divisions - Northwest India, Central India, East-Northeast India and South Peninsula - recorded deficit rainfall of 30%, 18%, 14% and 47%, respectively. Selling also crept in with the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) statement that Over 6,800 cases of bank fraud involving an unprecedented Rs 71,500 crore have been reported in 2018-19. In the last 11 fiscal years, a total of 53,334 cases of fraud were reported by banks involving a massive amount of Rs 2.05 lakh crore.</p><p>Markets continued their weak run in late afternoon deals, as anxiety remained among the traders with Industry chamber, Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) statement that the US decision to withdraw export incentives from India has been taken in a haste and would hurt the domestic exporters. CII President Vikram Kirloskar expressed hope that both the US and India would discuss the matter and find an amicable solution to this issue. However, further losses got restricted as investors found some comfort with Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg's statement that declining global oil prices, stable rupee and falling interest rate are sure signs of high growth in coming months. India's growth rate has declined to 5-year low of 5.8% in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal and 6.8% for the full financial year 2018-19. Traders took note of a report that India is forecast to overtake the UK to become the world's fifth largest economy this year and projected to surpass Japan to feature at the second position in the Asia-Pacific region by 2025. It added the economic outlook 'looks positive' for the second term of Modi government, with GDP growth forecast to average around 7 per cent per year over the 2019-2023 period.</p><p>On the global front, Asian markets ended mostly lower on Tuesday in cautious trade as worries about rising trade tensions and impact on global economic growth sapped risk appetite. European markets were trading in green, after the euro area unemployment rate dropped to the lowest since 2008 in April. The figures from Eurostat showed that the unemployment rate came in at 7.6 percent versus 7.7 percent in March. Back home, the power sector stocks were in focus with global ratings agency Moody's Investors Service's statement that the increasing share of renewables in the total energy mix of the country may lead to an increase in regulatory risk for coal-based projects in the long term.<br/><br/></p><p>The BSE Sensex ended at 40121.65, down by 145.97 points or 0.36% after trading in a range of 40031.05 and 40312.07. There were 14 stocks advancing against 17 stocks declining on the index.</p><p>The broader indices ended in red; the BSE Mid cap index fell 0.15%, while Small cap index was down by 0.21%.</p><p>The top gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Capital Goods up by 0.38%, Utilities up by 0.30%, Metal up by 0.29%, Telecom up by 0.24% and Industrials up by 0.13%, while IT down by 1.55%, TECK down by 1.44%, Oil &amp; Gas down by 0.88%, Healthcare down by 0.87% and Basic Materials down by 0.81% were the top losing indices on BSE.</p><p>The top gainers on the Sensex were Yes Bank up by 2.51%, Axis Bank up by 1.48%, NTPC up by 1.47%, Coal India up by 1.32% and Vedanta up by 1.25%. <br/><br/>On the flip side, Hero MotoCorp down by 3.11%, TCS down by 2.46%, Asian Paints down by 2.41%, HCL Tech. down by 2.09% and Bajaj Auto down by 1.68% were the top losers.</p><p>Meanwhile, expressing hopes on growth of economy, Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has said that declining global oil prices, stable rupee and falling interest rate are sure signs of high growth in coming months following the government's data showed that India's economy slowed down in the fourth quarter as well as in full fiscal year 2018-19.</p><p>Garg said 'Turn around in demand and financing conditions beginning well. PMI manufacturing is at 52.7. Crude is moving towards 60 dollars. Govt bond yield has gone below 7%. Spread for NBFCs/HFCs over Govt bond is narrowing. Rupee is firmly below 70. Sure signs of coming high growth.' Earlier, he had said slowdown would continue in the first quarter of this fiscal. However, he had expressed hope that growth will pick up from the second quarter of the current financial year.<br/><br/>Besides, India's growth rate has declined to 5-year low of 5.8% in in Q4FY19 and the country lost the fastest-growing large economy status, trailing China's growth (6.4%) for the first time in nearly two years. The full-year GDP growth, too, slumped to a five-year low of 6.8% in FY19.</p><p>The CNX Nifty ended at 12033.05, down by 55.50 points or 0.46% after trading in a range of 12005.85 and 12095.20. There were 17 stocks advancing against 33 stocks declining on the index.</p><p>The top gainers on Nifty were Yes Bank up by 2.68%, Bharti Infratel up by 2.05%, Axis Bank up by 1.51%, NTPC up by 1.43% and Vedanta up by 1.07%.</p><p>On the flip side, Zee Entertainment down by 3.85%, Hero MotoCorp down by 2.85%, Asian Paints down by 2.55%, Indian Oil Corp. down by 2.50% and TCS down by 2.43% were the top losers.</p><p>European markets were trading in green; UK's FTSE 100 increased 12.07 points or 0.17% to 7,196.87, France's CAC rose 5.50 points or 0.1% to 5,246.96 and Germany's DAX was up by 104.68 points or 0.89% to 11,897.49.</p><p>Asian markets ended mostly lower on Tuesday in cautious trade as worries about rising trade tensions and impact on global economic growth sapped risk appetite. Tech stocks in Asia followed their US counterparts lower as news of an antitrust probe into big tech companies stoked concerns about the sector. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that interest rates may have to be cut soon because of low inflation and the trade war's threat to the economy. Some forecasters now expect as many as two rate cuts by the end of the year. Seoul shares ended lower as weak GDP data and rising trade tensions dented investor sentiment.

Key indices have made a cautious start and traded marginally in red, as traders remain worried with a private report that the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. The three-month pre-monsoon season March, April and May ended with a rainfall deficiency of 25%. As per the report, all the four meteorological divisions - Northwest India, Central India, East-Northeast India and South Peninsula - recorded deficit rainfall of 30%, 18%, 14% and 47%, respectively. Selling also crept in with the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) statement that Over 6,800 cases of bank fraud involving an unprecedented Rs 71,500 crore have been reported in 2018-19. In the last 11 fiscal years, a total of 53,334 cases of fraud were reported by banks involving a massive amount of Rs 2.05 lakh crore.</p><p>Markets continued their weak run in late afternoon deals, as anxiety remained among the traders with Industry chamber, Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) statement that the US decision to withdraw export incentives from India has been taken in a haste and would hurt the domestic exporters. CII President Vikram Kirloskar expressed hope that both the US and India would discuss the matter and find an amicable solution to this issue. However, further losses got restricted as investors found some comfort with Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg's statement that declining global oil prices, stable rupee and falling interest rate are sure signs of high growth in coming months. India's growth rate has declined to 5-year low of 5.8% in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal and 6.8% for the full financial year 2018-19. Traders took note of a report that India is forecast to overtake the UK to become the world's fifth largest economy this year and projected to surpass Japan to feature at the second position in the Asia-Pacific region by 2025. It added the economic outlook 'looks positive' for the second term of Modi government, with GDP growth forecast to average around 7 per cent per year over the 2019-2023 period.</p><p>On the global front, Asian markets ended mostly lower on Tuesday in cautious trade as worries about rising trade tensions and impact on global economic growth sapped risk appetite. European markets were trading in green, after the euro area unemployment rate dropped to the lowest since 2008 in April. The figures from Eurostat showed that the unemployment rate came in at 7.6 percent versus 7.7 percent in March. Back home, the power sector stocks were in focus with global ratings agency Moody's Investors Service's statement that the increasing share of renewables in the total energy mix of the country may lead to an increase in regulatory risk for coal-based projects in the long term.</p><p>The BSE Sensex ended at 40121.65, down by 145.97 points or 0.36% after trading in a range of 40031.05 and 40312.07. There were 14 stocks advancing against 17 stocks declining on the index.</p><p>The broader indices ended in red; the BSE Mid cap index fell 0.15%, while Small cap index was down by 0.21%.</p><p>The top gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Capital Goods up by 0.38%, Utilities up by 0.30%, Metal up by 0.29%, Telecom up by 0.24% and Industrials up by 0.13%, while IT down by 1.55%, TECK down by 1.44%, Oil &amp;#38; Gas down by 0.88%, Healthcare down by 0.87% and Basic Materials down by 0.81% were the top losing indices on BSE.</p><p>The top gainers on the Sensex were Yes Bank up by 2.51%, Axis Bank up by 1.48%, NTPC up by 1.47%, Coal India up by 1.32% and Vedanta up by 1.25%. On the flip side, Hero MotoCorp down by 3.11%, TCS down by 2.46%, Asian Paints down by 2.41%, HCL Tech. down by 2.09% and Bajaj Auto down by 1.68% were the top losers.</p><p>Meanwhile, expressing hopes on growth of economy, Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has said that declining global oil prices, stable rupee and falling interest rate are sure signs of high growth in coming months following the government's data showed that India's economy slowed down in the fourth quarter as well as in full fiscal year 2018-19.</p><p>Garg said 'Turn around in demand and financing conditions beginning well. PMI manufacturing is at 52.7. Crude is moving towards 60 dollars. Govt bond yield has gone below 7%. Spread for NBFCs/HFCs over Govt bond is narrowing. Rupee is firmly below 70. Sure signs of coming high growth.' Earlier, he had said slowdown would continue in the first quarter of this fiscal. However, he had expressed hope that growth will pick up from the second quarter of the current financial year.Besides, India's growth rate has declined to 5-year low of 5.8% in in Q4FY19 and the country lost the fastest-growing large economy status, trailing China's growth (6.4%) for the first time in nearly two years. The full-year GDP growth, too, slumped to a five-year low of 6.8% in FY19.</p><p>The CNX Nifty ended at 12033.05, down by 55.50 points or 0.46% after trading in a range of 12005.85 and 12095.20. There were 17 stocks advancing against 33 stocks declining on the index.</p><p>The top gainers on Nifty were Yes Bank up by 2.68%, Bharti Infratel up by 2.05%, Axis Bank up by 1.51%, NTPC up by 1.43% and Vedanta up by 1.07%.</p><p>On the flip side, Zee Entertainment down by 3.85%, Hero MotoCorp down by 2.85%, Asian Paints down by 2.55%, Indian Oil Corp. down by 2.50% and TCS down by 2.43% were the top losers.</p><p>European markets were trading in green; UK's FTSE 100 increased 12.07 points or 0.17% to 7,196.87, France's CAC rose 5.50 points or 0.1% to 5,246.96 and Germany's DAX was up by 104.68 points or 0.89% to 11,897.49.</p><p>Asian markets ended mostly lower on Tuesday in cautious trade as worries about rising trade tensions and impact on global economic growth sapped risk appetite. Tech stocks in Asia followed their US counterparts lower as news of an antitrust probe into big tech companies stoked concerns about the sector. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that interest rates may have to be cut soon because of low inflation and the trade war's threat to the economy. Some forecasters now expect as many as two rate cuts by the end of the year. Seoul shares ended lower as weak GDP data and rising trade tensions dented investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Japanese shares closed flat with a negative bias in choppy trade amid worries about global economic growth and on a stronger safe-haven yen.

Earlier this year Fisher-Price recalled almost 5m Rock 'n Play infant sleepers in the US after more than 30 babies rolled over in them and died. The firm's owner, toy giant Mattel, was forced to set aside $27m to cover the cost of the recall and also faced legal action over claims that its advertising for the Rock 'n Play devices misled customers.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">Read Hannah Uttley's report to find out more</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">4:57PM</url>European markets closeStocks in London have closed for the day, with the FTSE 100 closing 021pc higher to 7,540.75 and the FTSE 250 falling 0.12pc to 21,663.13,The pound is still suffering from Brexit worries,which pushed international companies higher.Pharmaceutical firm Hikma jumped 4pc and global equipment rental company climbed Ashtead 3pc .On the opposite end of the scale, UK housebuilders were among the biggest fallers with Berkeley and Persimmon both down 2pc.European Closing Prices:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#FTSE</url> 7540.75 +0.21%      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#DAX</url> 13222.16-0.49%      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#CAC</url> 5959.6-0.15%      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#AEX</url> 606.04-0.03%      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#MIB</url> 23628.87-0.01%      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#IBEX</url> 9621.8 +0.06%      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">#STOXX</url> 3742.93-0.06%- IGSquawk (@IGSquawk)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">December 18, 2019</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">4:41PM</url>Analysis: $50bn Fiat-Peugeot deal underlines the pressure on carmakers from an electric future\"The $50bn merger of PSA Group and FiatChrysler is just the latest example of how the car industry is facing up to a worrying future,\" my colleague Alan Tovey writes. Although electric vehicles herald a cleaner world, the massive upheaval that developing and building these environmentally friendly cars also entails costs that are straining balance sheets. Other technology, such as self-driving systems, just piles on the pressure.All this comes against a backdrop of a slowing global economy and easing sales, with some thinking that the world may have already hit \"peak car\", with the growth of car sharing and autonomous vehicles only likely to lessen the necessity to actually own a vehicle.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">Read his full analysis here</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">4:33PM</url>Good afternoonWe'll be taking a look at how markets in Europe closed very shortly.There was a sense of weariness to the markets this Wednesday, caught between the election-slash-trade deal overstimulation of the last few sessions, and the awareness that the end of the year draws ever closer, says Connor Campbell at SpreadEx.

Shares in AJ Bell have more than doubled in value since the fund shop floated on the London Stock Exchange in December 2018. The surge means Mr Bell's remaining stake is worth about \u00a3415m.

He writes:Living costs are rising faster for retired Britons than for the wider population, as a record gap in inflation rates opens up a new divide between people of different ages.Prices rose by 1.8pc for those aged over 65 in the 12 months to September, but by 1.6pc for working-aged families.The gap was driven by the rising cost of package holidays-disproportionately bought by older travellers-compared with lower transport costs, which aided those heading to work every day. Toys and games are also getting cheaper, benefitting younger households, which are more likely than grandparents to purchase video games.Inflation rates vary for everyone because each person spends their money on different items and in different quantities, but the Office for National Statistics seeks to calculate an overall rate for average households.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>: Pricey cruises help drive up cost of living for pensioners</p></bodyText></listItem></list>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">12:45PM</url>World's largest crane completes first operation at Hinkley Point COvernight, Hinkley Point C engineers managed to complete the first big lift by 'Big Carl', the world's largest crane.The 250m tall crane lifted a 170 tonne prefabricated part of the reactor's steel containment liner into place at 4.30am, taking advantage of a small weather window.The site's managing director Stuart Crooks said:The first big lift is another impressive achievement and I want to thank the teams who've worked so hard to make this possible.

After all, at 1.5pc, the unchanged rate of inflation was a little above the projection made by the Bank of England in November and the consensus forecast of 1.4pc...Admittedly, the figures confirmed that price pressures at the start of the production process remain very weak. The annual rate of input price inflation remained close to October's three-and-a-half year low. And output price inflation slipped further from 0.8pc to 0.5pc in November. As a result, with inflation well below target, little sign of underlying price pressures and GDP growth running below trend, an interest rate cut on Thursday shouldn't be completely ruled out.Even so, coupled with yesterday's robust labour market figures the pressure on the MPC to cut interest rates at its meeting tomorrow appears to have eased somewhat. We continue to expect the MPC to keep rates on hold at 0.75pc on Thursday and for some time to come.Here's how the Bank's base rate currently stands:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">9:51AM</url>UK inflation stays at three-year lowConsumer price inflation in the UK has stayed at its lowest rate since 2016, which is likely to compound calls for an interest rate cut from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee when it meets tomorrow.The overall CPI inflation rate was 1.5pc (against expectations of a 1.4pc rise), with the core measure - which excludes volatile elements such as fuel - at 1.7pc.The ONS said the largest contribution to higher prices came from \"housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels\", with recreation and culture prices also rising.There was also a large contribution from the food and non-alcoholic beverages section, in which \"boxes and cartons of chocolates, and chocolate covered ice cream bars drove the upward movement\".The figure remains below the Bank's target inflation rate of 2pc.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">9:36AM</url>Boom day for windfarms means some drivers paid to charge their carsMy colleague Ed Clowes reports:Have you ever dreamt of being paid to use electricity, rather than the other way around?Well, electric vehicle owners across the country were lucky enough to discover what this felt like on December 8, when they were actually paid to charge their cars thanks to the blustery weather conditions.High winds caused excess electricity on the grid, and to use it up, electrical vehicle owners on an Octopus tariff and using Ohme chargers were notified of the opportunity to be paid to juice their cars.The UK's wind farms generated a record amount of electricity that day, accounting for 45pc of the country's energy.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pricey-cruises-help-drive-cost-living-pensioners/\">9:27AM</url>German business sentiment improveBusiness expectations in Germany have continued to improve, according to the latest survey data from the Ifo Institute.A climb in sentiment indicators across the board suggests manufacturers are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel after a yearlong downturn.

Smaller rivals such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo have\u00a0powerful private equity backers, but have shown less of an ability to turn a profit.

Driven by its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and a group of 27 partners, the idea is that it will start working in 2020 and its goal, as announced in the presentation, is to \"offer a simple, global currency\" through blockchain technology.</p><p><br/>But the Libra project isn't just that. It's much, much more. It is an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">idea of such colossal dimensions</emphasis> that this is the only way to explain the near-unanimous response of governments, regulators and supervisors worldwide to try to stop it. Without going any further, it has been one of the central themes of the g-7 finance ministers' meeting this week in Chantilly, France, where they have come to call it \"systemic\" risk. A few days earlier, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed concerns that it could be a pathway to money laundering and also in recent weeks, both the ECB and the Fed have warned that they will monitor and act to meet all legal requirements.<br/>Too many fears for something that presented itself as a cryptocurrency. And that is the key, that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Libra is not only a cryptocurrency,</emphasis>but that behind the project is actually the pretence of Zuckerberg and his partners - the so-called Libra Association - to create a financial system beyond the direct control and supervision of the great powers now handled by the designs of the world economy: Wall Street, central banks, supervisors, regulators, governments, business giants...<br/>\"The crypto asset market until now seemed to pose no plausible threat to governments, and regulators were moderately calm, partly because of the small volume they represent in the global market and partly because it is still a thing of a small group of citizens. However, the creation and commissioning of one of these assets by a company that has 2.560 million monthly users (not to mention those of other companies in the same group) is flour of another costal\", notes <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cristina Carrascosa</emphasis>, Of Counsel at Pinsent Masons and member of the Blockchain Observatory of the European Commission.<br/>\"Everyone will watch Pound with some hostility because they have always tried to control the monopoly of the money supply: it is profitable and it is also the mechanism to try to insof more or less economic activity by monetary means, apart from representing an element sovereignty. This tradition has been going on for millennia and therefore change will not be easy,\" says Ignacio de la Torre, associate and chief economist of Arcano.<br/>Assimilating with some of the most popular virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook positions its new creature to some extent until it can get it going, but the truth is that there are many more things that separate them than those that bind them together.<br/>\"It's a cryptographic asset, or it's clear from the technical documents that have been published, but it differs from Ether or Bitcoin in almost everything else: it's controlled by a small group of companies, backed by low-risk assets, it's not yet known exactly what it's going to do...\" lists Carrascosa.<br/>Moreover, it is not anonymous and does not fluctuate freely by supply and demand, but \"is a stable coin, that is, its value will be backed by assets in a hard currency, presumably the dollar\", adds De la Torre.<br/>This implies that the value of Libra will depend on the assets held in the reserve createdby the members of the Association and not the dynamics of supply and demand, as is the case with Bitcoin. In addition, the most popular virtual currencies are based on a decentralized blockchain network, i.e. the network itself approves transactions, while Libra is centralized, so it is the consortium that validates each transaction and, therefore, who has the control and power.<br/>There's a lot of regulators' concern here. This week, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David</emphasis>Marcus, executive director of Calibra and libra's integration officer on Facebook services, appeared before the U.S. Senate's Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee to provide more details of the project. The senators wanted to know what Libra is for, what it will be used for or how users' safety will be ensured, among other things. No one really knows how to deal with this new scenario.<br/>Facebook representatives have recently met with regulatory authorities in several European countries to survey the field. In Spain, the president of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Securities Market Commission</emphasis> (CNMV), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sebasti\u00e1n Albella,</emphasis>confirmed the meeting with a company delegation and assured in an interview for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE WORLD</emphasis> that the aim was to exchange positions in a first contact.<br/>Incursion into traditional banking<br/>The other big tentacle of Facebook's cryptoproject hits the traditional banking business. Should We link Libra to the landing of Facebook - and, in general, Big Tech<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(Facebook, Amazon, Apple and</emphasis>Google) - in that sector? \"Absolutely yes,\" Carrascosa said. \"If you look at the Libra Whitepaper, many of the statements refer to financial inclusion, which has been the leitmotiv in the cryptocurrency industry, but if you look at the detail there are concepts like borrowing daily, frictionless payments and others that may sound like Facebook wants to offer financial products on blockchain,\" he adds.<br/>In the market, this is one of the aspects that generates the most concern. Great technology has long been underway, although the regulatory and solvency demands they would face act as a brake.<br/>It is likely that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">neither Google nor Amazon nor Apple nor Facebook wants to be a big</emphasis>bank, but they are all looking to trade in some way with their users' money. At the moment, they have licenses as payment institutions, allowing them to make transfers, process receipts, card payments and even provide financing to customers. What they can't do, because for that they would need a bank card, is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to capture deposits.</emphasis><br/>That, of course, whenever we talk about the financial system as we know it, because \"the new [Facebook] platform could provide an alternative ecosystem for payments, avoiding existing players and ignoring some of the roles they play banks,\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moody's</emphasis> states in a libra analysis.<br/>The threat to traditional entities is not insignificant and not only because of the technological knowledge and development they cherish, \"but above all because, until the legislation is changed, they intend to enter such a business without going down the tortuous path of regulation and compliance that banks do go through,\" says Pinsent Masons' lawyer. This has led to the US considering banning technology from accessing this industry by law.<br/>As techs like Facebook position themselves as financial service providers, their success could allow them to control not onlybut also compete more directly with traditional operators by profiling carefully tailored financial products for each customer. The devices will be a kind of chivato to follow each person's consumption practices every second. \"If you cross the data collected by the consortium with which Facebook owns, it will be relatively easy to guess what kind of customer it is. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You can extract very valuable information... and dangerous,\"</emphasis>Warns De la Torre.<br/>Security and privacy<br/>Security and privacy therefore come into play. Without them, one of our most sensitive parts would be laid bare:<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> how we spend the</emphasis>money. Technological measures \"could relatively easily deduct payments from a line of credit or, given the network effect, threaten the expulsion of their ecosystem in the event of default, refuse to pay basic goods with Libra if the debt is not repaid, or even , threatening to unveil personal data,\" says <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joaqu\u00edn Rivera,</emphasis>an economist from Arcano.<br/>But it's not all that negative. Zuckerberg and the Libra Association argue that their project will bring finance to the world's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">unbanked</emphasis>population, some 2 billion people: accessing financial services via mobile, they say, opens a way to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">end the poverty.</emphasis><br/>\"Creating an ecosystem around a digital currency can lead to enormous possibilities, for example, for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to enjoy cost reduction and traceability of their projects,\" Rivera says.<br/>\"The problem is that if the people of poor countries start depositing their savings in Libra, the central banks of those countries will have no way of using monetary policy to boost the economy,\" De la Torre replies of the alleged altruism of Zuckerberg. It would therefore depend on those who exercise control of Libra.<br/>Despite the controversy and the obstacles that emerge at every step of its drivers, it is difficult at the moment to think that the project will be diluted; something else is what its end result is. The countdown to check it has begun.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-7746435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM9-V6N1-JBJN-M1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 21, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000C4AF</classCode><className>PINSENT MASONS LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, told Reuters:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What we're seeing is a combination of defence positioning, with people taking some profit out of the high-growth areas, technology specifically, and rotating into sectors that should hold up better if we get any negative news on the tax bill or debt ceiling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile bitcoin is currently up nearly 9% at $10,741 although off the day's highs of 11,395.</p><p>In Europe the final scores showed:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The FTSE 100 finished down 67.09 points or 0.9% at 7393.56</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Germany's Dax edged up 0.02% to 13,061.87</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>France's Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5398.05</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 22,325.94</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Spain's Ibex ended 1.22% better at 10,267.7</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In Greece, the Athens market added 1.67% to 738.31</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 67 points or 0.28%.</p><p>On that note, it's time to close for the day.

Helena Smith writes:</p><p>In Greece's civil court, police have fired rounds of tear gas and been engaged in hand to hand battle with protestors opposing first electronic auctions demanded by creditors in bid to finally deal with Greece's mountain of bad bank loans.</p><p>     Protesters clash with riot police as they attempt to enter a courtroom in Athens Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images      Clashes outside the court room in Athens.

The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth (EURO)30bn, writes Helena Smith:</p><p>Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %.</p><p>\"It is a huge development... and of huge significance for the country,\" he told reporters this afternoon. \"In reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country's] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\"</p><p>Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. </p><p>block-time published-time 4.15pm GMT </p><p>More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p><p>Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses.</p><p>The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end.</p><p>block-time published-time 4.06pm GMT </p><p>One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%.</p><p>block-time published-time 4.06pm GMT </p><p>Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. She made positive noises about the US economy, saying \"the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\"</p><p>This makes a December rate rise even more likely, which has helped banking shares, and more increases could follow. Yellen said, \"We continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\"</p><p>    Yellen at the hearing of the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images      </p><p>block-time published-time 3.47pm GMT </p><p>Wall Street is continuing its surge higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p><p>After a relatively sluggish few weeks the Dow has burst into life in the last couple of sessions. Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it's up another 80 points - who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump's progress in pushing through his - increasingly unpopular - tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday's cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate.</p><p>block-time published-time 3.30pm GMT </p><p>What goes up...

Forecasts for average earnings growth next year fall between 2.5% and 3% the commission said.</p><p>The weakest rise is being handed to 16 and 17 year olds, who must survive on \u00a34.20, up 3.7% on this year.</p><p>The commission said:</p><p>\"The new rates will boost the earnings of between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly, and many more young workers will benefit. </p><p>\"This is for two reasons: firstly, these increases lead to 'spillover' effects further up the pay distribution; secondly, even though they are not entitled to it, some young workers benefit from increases in the NLW. We estimate that up to 45% of 18-24 year old workers - or 1.3 million young people - could receive a higher pay increase than they would have done in the absence of the NLW.\"</p><p>block-time published-time 2.51pm GMT </p><p> Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 hit record highs  </p><p> Boom! The US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both climbed to new levels, following the upgrade in US growth in the last quarter.</p><p>    The open of Wall Street today Photograph: Bloomberg   </p><p> Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, &lt;strong /&gt; Infinox , sums up the mood: </p><p>\"Today's second estimate of US GDP shows the world's largest economy is clearly firing on all cylinders.\"</p><p>block-time published-time 2.35pm GMT </p><p>If Donald Trump takes his fingers off the retweet button, he'll notice that the US economy appears to be doing pretty well on his watch.</p><p>Here's Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics on the new growth figures : </p><p>Third-quarter GDP growth was revised up modestly to 3.3% annualised, from 3.0%, thanks to a stronger positive contribution from business investment and a much smaller drag from State and local government expenditure. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers was revised up as well to 2.5%, from 2.3%.</p><p>Business investment growth is now estimated to have been 4.7% annualised, with equipment investment up by 10.4%.

In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved higher after positive remarks on the economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, but technology stocks have come under pressure. Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, told Reuters: What we're seeing is a combination of defence positioning, with people taking some profit out of the high-growth areas, technology specifically, and rotating into sectors that should hold up better if we get any negative news on the tax bill or debt ceiling. Meanwhile bitcoin is currently up nearly 9% at $10,741 although off the day's highs of 11,395. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 67.09 points or 0.9% at 7393.56 Germany's Dax edged up 0.02% to 13,061.87 France's Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5398.05 Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 22,325.94 Spain's Ibex ended 1.22% better at 10,267.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.67% to 738.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 67 points or 0.28%. On that note, it's time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. But there are some less positive developments in Greece, too. Helena Smith writes: In Greece's civil court, police have fired rounds of tear gas and been engaged in hand to hand battle with protestors opposing first electronic auctions demanded by creditors in bid to finally deal with Greece's mountain of bad bank loans. Over in Greece, some positive developments. The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth (EURO)30bn, writes Helena Smith: Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %. \"It is a huge development... and of huge significance for the country,\" he told reporters this afternoon. \"In reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country's] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\" Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses. The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end. One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%. Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. She made positive noises about the US economy, saying \"the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\" This makes a December rate rise even more likely, which has helped banking shares, and more increases could follow. Yellen said, \"We continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\" Wall Street is continuing its surge higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a relatively sluggish few weeks the Dow has burst into life in the last couple of sessions. Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it's up another 80 points - who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump's progress in pushing through his - increasingly unpopular - tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday's cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate. What goes up... Bitcoin is now at $10,479, down from its peak today of $11,395 but still up from the $9,868 it opened at. Back in the UK, the national minimum wage received by the lowest-paid workers is in the spotlight. The Low Pay Commission, which recommends the minimum wage rates, said in its annual report published this morning that the new rates for 18-20 and 21-24 year olds follow the biggest rise for both age groups in a decade. We already know the rates, which were published last week as part of the budget, but analysis in the report that shows increases from 1 April 2018 of 4.7% and 5.4% respectively \"will benefit between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly\" after the largest up-rating since 2007. A lower percentage rise has been applied to the National Living Wage (NLW), which covers those aged 25 years old and beyond, of 4.4 per cent. Forecasts for average earnings growth next year fall between 2.5% and 3% the commission said. The weakest rise is being handed to 16 and 17 year olds, who must survive on \u00a34.20, up 3.7% on this year. The commission said: \"The new rates will boost the earnings of between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly, and many more young workers will benefit. \"This is for two reasons: firstly, these increases lead to 'spillover' effects further up the pay distribution; secondly, even though they are not entitled to it, some young workers benefit from increases in the NLW. We estimate that up to 45% of 18-24 year old workers - or 1.3 million young people - could receive a higher pay increase than they would have done in the absence of the NLW.\" Boom! The US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both climbed to new levels, following the upgrade in US growth in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, sums up the mood: \"Today's second estimate of US GDP shows the world's largest economy is clearly firing on all cylinders.\" If Donald Trump takes his fingers off the retweet button, he'll notice that the US economy appears to be doing pretty well on his watch. Here's Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics on the new growth figures: Third-quarter GDP growth was revised up modestly to 3.3% annualised, from 3.0%, thanks to a stronger positive contribution from business investment and a much smaller drag from State and local government expenditure. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers was revised up as well to 2.5%, from 2.3%. Business investment growth is now estimated to have been 4.7% annualised, with equipment investment up by 10.4%. With borrowing costs still relatively low, confidence strong and capex intentions surveys at elevated levels, we expect another decent gain in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin just smashed through $11,000, defying the doubters with their taunts about tulip bulbs.... Despite its summer surge, the US hasn't grown quite as fast as the eurozone over the last year. It's comfortably outpacing Britain, though.... Economists are cheering the news that America's economy expanded by 3.3% (annualised) in the last three months. This upward revision suggests the US is in decent shape. Here's some early reaction: BREAKING: America's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2017. Fresh figures from the Commerce Department shows that US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.3% in July-September, up from a first estimate of 3.0%. That's equal to a quarterly growth rate of over 0.8% -- twice as fast as Britain's 0.4% in Q3. The new data shows that corporate profits boosted growth, jumping by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter. Net trade also boosted growth, with exports up by 2.2% but imports down by 1.1%. Reaction to follow.... German bank Berenberg has raised their forecasts for UK growth over the next couple of years, on optimism that a hard Brexit can be avoided. They say: We raise our calls for real GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 to 1.8% and 1.9% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, following modest increases to our growth projections for household consumption and business investment. Our forecasts exceed Bloomberg consensus (29 November 2017) of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. We see risks to the growth outlook as roughly balanced. Foreign exchange news site DailyFX flags up that the pound has outperformed other currencies against the dollar today: The price of bitcoin is going up even faster than Britain's potential Brexit bill. The cryptocurrency smashed through the $10,000 mark overnight, and is currently changing hands at $10,900. That means it's risen by around 1,000% during 2017. Five years ago, you could have bought a bitcoin for only $12.... The higher bitcoin goes, the louder are the warnings that it's an unsustainable speculative bubble. But then, I can remember the same warnings back in 2013! Sir Jon Cunliffe, the BoE deputy governor, has suggested that potential bitcoin investors should be cautious. He told BBC Radio 5 this morning that: \"This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There's no central bank that stands behind it. For me it's much more like a commodity. \"This is not at a size where it's a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.\" Back to Brexit, and the BBC's Katya Adler reports that some EU officials are irritated that the \u00a350bn settlement hit the headlines last night. Although they do want money from the UK, they don't want to be bounced into an agreement. They also don't accept that any payment will guarantee Britain the post-Brexit deal it wants... She writes: If and when an agreement on the Brexit bill is made, the EU will push back hard at UK government assertions that Brexit financial payments be tied to a future trade and transition deal. Brussels insists this is money the UK owes - dating back to commitments made on annual and long-term budgets while an EU member. \"This is not blood money,\" an EU civil servant told me. \"This is money the UK must pay on leaving the EU. The new relationship post-Brexit Britain will have with the EU is something quite separate. Europe is not about to be blackmailed.\" Breaking away from Brexit briefly, shipping company Clarksons has admitted it's been hacked. Clarksons told the City that it has been working with the police since discovering a cybersecurity incident which involved \"unauthorised access to the Company's computer systems\". It warned shareholders that those responsible \"may release some data\" today. Andi Case, CEO of Clarksons, has hinted that the company refused to pay the hackers to return stolen data, saying: I hope our clients understand that we would not be held to ransom by criminals, and I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have understandably raised.\" More evidence that the eurozone economy is ending 2017 on a high, from the EC's latest health check: Despite Brexit uncertainty, individuals and businesses in Europe are increasingly optimistic. New data from the European Commission shows that eurozone consumer and economic confidence jumped again in November, to their highest level in 17 years. Newsflash: UK households reined in their borrowing last month. Unsecured consumer credit (such as borrowing on credit cards) grew by 9.6% in October compared to a year ago, down from 9.8% in September. That's the smallest rise since April 2016, and follows concerns that people were being driven into debt by rising inflation and falling real wages. New Bank of England figures also show a fall in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, down to 64,575 in October from over 66,000 in September. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has defended the government against criticism that it might stump up \u00a350bn to leave the EU. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK has financial obligations to settle, adding: \"I don't think people in this country would expect us to just walk away from things we've already said we'd pay for.\" Bonus marks to anyone who spotted that on the side of a bus last year. Anyway, Andrew Sparrow's Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster today: The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has sounded a cautious note about the \u00a350bn figure. Collared by reporters in Berlin this morning, Barnier suggested that a deal wasn't agreed yet. He said: \"We are still working.....I am working for an agreement.\" The pound has rallied against \"all of its 16 major\" rival currencies this morning, reports Bloomberg. Even if a \u00a350bn bill is agreed, Britain faces several hurdles to jump before it can avoid a disorderly Brexit. As well as the Irish question, Brussels also wants commitments on EU citizen rights beyond 2019. Plus, we don't know that parliament will approve a hefty divorce bill. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital says: First, can Theresa May sell this to voters and to her party. She seems to have some shaky consensus backing for a higher offer but this is contingent on getting a good trade deal - the EU will not have its hands tied in this way. Therefore we must be wary that the political consensus to pay a bigger bill could unravel; and paying a big bill does not by definition lead to a good trade deal. Capitulating to the EU in this regard carries its own risks for Theresa May, but the risk of a no-deal exit was ultimately too high. Second, the Irish border is still a major stumbling block and it is uncertain whether sufficient progress has been made on this front. This is an even more sensitive topic than the divorce bill and is not as easy to solve with a bigger cheque. The third key barrier for the EU is citizens' rights and again it is unclear if there is sufficient progress in this regard. Sterling has jumped by 1.4% against a basket of currencies, its biggest rise since April, according to Reuters data. Christmas has come early for Brussels, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank wryly. He expects an official agreement on the Brexit bill next month, following the news that the UK has caved in to demands for a \u00a350bn payment. We expect UK PM Theresa May to present a formal offer on the Brexit bill, EU citizens rights, and the Irish border question at the upcoming 4 December dinner between May and EU Commission president Juncker. We expect the offer to meet the EU's requirement for 'sufficient progress' on the Brexit divorce. If such progress is made, expect the UK and the EU to move negotiations on to potential transitional arrangements and post-Brexit trade at the 14-15 December EU Summit. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you'd expect, there's an at-a-glance agenda of the day's main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain's exit bill is only one part of the Brexit puzzle, of course. We still don't have any idea how the Irish border question will be resolved; Dublin could block negotiations on trade unless its fears over a hard border are assuaged. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Picking up the Brexit bill has been the very thorny issue since day one and given that now the government has agreed to a respectable amount, the talks between the UK and the EU (which are set to resume next month) should be smoother. If the EU accepts the bill, then we will be moving to the next hurdle which is securing the EU rights [of citizens living in the UK. It is important to keep in mind that we are no way close to be out of the woods when it comes to the smooth negotiation process because the Northern Ireland issue is still the thorny matter. The pound is continuing to climb against the US dollar as investors bet that the Brexit fog is clearing. As Stephen Gallo at the Bank of Montreal put it (via the FT): It's a buy! The risk of snap election is down, the risk of a 'hard Brexit' is down, the path to a transition deal is clearing. The surge in the pound has hit shares in the City. The FTSE 100 is down 31 points at 7429; a stronger sterling reduces the value of money earned overseas by UK-based multinationals. The prospect that Britain and the EU might shake hands on a Brexit bill next month is exciting the City this morning. \u00a350bn is obviously a lot of money, even if split over many years. But traders think it could be worth it, if it opens the door to trade talks. Konstantinos Anthis of brokerage firm ADS Securities explains: Even though the agreement is not yet formal traders are clearly excited by the prospect of progress on this issue. Traders are looking for any positive news in this area as it opens the way for trade negotiations, and are prepared to buy sterling in response. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Sterling is on a roll this morning, amid signs that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit breakthrough. The pound has jumped to $1.3406, up almost three quarters of a cent, to its highest level since the end of September. It is also pushing higher against the euro, up 0.3% at (EURO)1.13. The rally was triggered by reports that London could pay a \u00a350bn exit bill, in an attempt to nudge European politicians into starting negotiations about trade. A deal would ease fears that Britain could crash out of the EU in March 2019 in a disorderly Brexit. EU leaders will decide next month whether this is enough to move negotiations onto trade, so this could be a very significant moment. As my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin reported last night: Non-stop behind-the-scenes negotiations have led to a broad agreement by the UK to a gross financial settlement of \u00a389bn on leaving the bloc, although the British expect the final net bill to be half as much. A senior EU official told the Guardian that the UK appeared ready to honour its share of the EU's unpaid bills, loans, pension and other liabilities accrued over 44 years of membership. \"We have heard the UK wants to come along with the money,\" the official said. \"We have understood it covers the liabilities and what we consider the real commitments. But we have to see the fine print.\" The bill could total \u00a353bn to \u00a358bn ((EURO)60bn to (EURO)65bn), although EU officials are not discussing numbers and the British government will fight hard to bring the total down.

The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth (EURO)30bn, writes Helena Smith: Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %. \"It is a huge development... and of huge significance for the country,\" he told reporters this afternoon. \"In reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country's] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\" Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses. The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end. One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%. Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. She made positive noises about the US economy, saying \"the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\" This makes a December rate rise even more likely, which has helped banking shares, and more increases could follow. Yellen said, \"We continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\" Wall Street is continuing its surge higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a relatively sluggish few weeks the Dow has burst into life in the last couple of sessions. Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it's up another 80 points - who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump's progress in pushing through his - increasingly unpopular - tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday's cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate. What goes up... Bitcoin is now at $10,479, down from its peak today of $11,395 but still up from the $9,868 it opened at. Back in the UK, the national minimum wage received by the lowest-paid workers is in the spotlight. The Low Pay Commission, which recommends the minimum wage rates, said in its annual report published this morning that the new rates for 18-20 and 21-24 year olds follow the biggest rise for both age groups in a decade. We already know the rates, which were published last week as part of the budget, but analysis in the report that shows increases from 1 April 2018 of 4.7% and 5.4% respectively \"will benefit between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly\" after the largest up-rating since 2007. A lower percentage rise has been applied to the National Living Wage (NLW), which covers those aged 25 years old and beyond, of 4.4 per cent. Forecasts for average earnings growth next year fall between 2.5% and 3% the commission said. The weakest rise is being handed to 16 and 17 year olds, who must survive on \u00a34.20, up 3.7% on this year. The commission said: \"The new rates will boost the earnings of between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly, and many more young workers will benefit. \"This is for two reasons: firstly, these increases lead to 'spillover' effects further up the pay distribution; secondly, even though they are not entitled to it, some young workers benefit from increases in the NLW. We estimate that up to 45% of 18-24 year old workers - or 1.3 million young people - could receive a higher pay increase than they would have done in the absence of the NLW.\" Boom! The US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both climbed to new levels, following the upgrade in US growth in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, sums up the mood: \"Today's second estimate of US GDP shows the world's largest economy is clearly firing on all cylinders.\" If Donald Trump takes his fingers off the retweet button, he'll notice that the US economy appears to be doing pretty well on his watch. Here's Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics on the new growth figures: Third-quarter GDP growth was revised up modestly to 3.3% annualised, from 3.0%, thanks to a stronger positive contribution from business investment and a much smaller drag from State and local government expenditure. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers was revised up as well to 2.5%, from 2.3%. Business investment growth is now estimated to have been 4.7% annualised, with equipment investment up by 10.4%. With borrowing costs still relatively low, confidence strong and capex intentions surveys at elevated levels, we expect another decent gain in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin just smashed through $11,000, defying the doubters with their taunts about tulip bulbs.... Despite its summer surge, the US hasn't grown quite as fast as the eurozone over the last year. It's comfortably outpacing Britain, though.... Economists are cheering the news that America's economy expanded by 3.3% (annualised) in the last three months. This upward revision suggests the US is in decent shape. Here's some early reaction: BREAKING: America's economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2017. Fresh figures from the Commerce Department shows that US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.3% in July-September, up from a first estimate of 3.0%. That's equal to a quarterly growth rate of over 0.8% -- twice as fast as Britain's 0.4% in Q3. The new data shows that corporate profits boosted growth, jumping by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter. Net trade also boosted growth, with exports up by 2.2% but imports down by 1.1%. Reaction to follow.... German bank Berenberg has raised their forecasts for UK growth over the next couple of years, on optimism that a hard Brexit can be avoided. They say: We raise our calls for real GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 to 1.8% and 1.9% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, following modest increases to our growth projections for household consumption and business investment. Our forecasts exceed Bloomberg consensus (29 November 2017) of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. We see risks to the growth outlook as roughly balanced. Foreign exchange news site DailyFX flags up that the pound has outperformed other currencies against the dollar today: The price of bitcoin is going up even faster than Britain's potential Brexit bill. The cryptocurrency smashed through the $10,000 mark overnight, and is currently changing hands at $10,900. That means it's risen by around 1,000% during 2017. Five years ago, you could have bought a bitcoin for only $12.... The higher bitcoin goes, the louder are the warnings that it's an unsustainable speculative bubble. But then, I can remember the same warnings back in 2013! Sir Jon Cunliffe, the BoE deputy governor, has suggested that potential bitcoin investors should be cautious. He told BBC Radio 5 this morning that: \"This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There's no central bank that stands behind it. For me it's much more like a commodity. \"This is not at a size where it's a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.\" Back to Brexit, and the BBC's Katya Adler reports that some EU officials are irritated that the \u00a350bn settlement hit the headlines last night. Although they do want money from the UK, they don't want to be bounced into an agreement. They also don't accept that any payment will guarantee Britain the post-Brexit deal it wants... She writes: If and when an agreement on the Brexit bill is made, the EU will push back hard at UK government assertions that Brexit financial payments be tied to a future trade and transition deal. Brussels insists this is money the UK owes - dating back to commitments made on annual and long-term budgets while an EU member. \"This is not blood money,\" an EU civil servant told me. \"This is money the UK must pay on leaving the EU. The new relationship post-Brexit Britain will have with the EU is something quite separate. Europe is not about to be blackmailed.\" Breaking away from Brexit briefly, shipping company Clarksons has admitted it's been hacked. Clarksons told the City that it has been working with the police since discovering a cybersecurity incident which involved \"unauthorised access to the Company's computer systems\". It warned shareholders that those responsible \"may release some data\" today. Andi Case, CEO of Clarksons, has hinted that the company refused to pay the hackers to return stolen data, saying: I hope our clients understand that we would not be held to ransom by criminals, and I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have understandably raised.\" More evidence that the eurozone economy is ending 2017 on a high, from the EC's latest health check: Despite Brexit uncertainty, individuals and businesses in Europe are increasingly optimistic. New data from the European Commission shows that eurozone consumer and economic confidence jumped again in November, to their highest level in 17 years. Newsflash: UK households reined in their borrowing last month. Unsecured consumer credit (such as borrowing on credit cards) grew by 9.6% in October compared to a year ago, down from 9.8% in September. That's the smallest rise since April 2016, and follows concerns that people were being driven into debt by rising inflation and falling real wages. New Bank of England figures also show a fall in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, down to 64,575 in October from over 66,000 in September. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has defended the government against criticism that it might stump up \u00a350bn to leave the EU. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK has financial obligations to settle, adding: \"I don't think people in this country would expect us to just walk away from things we've already said we'd pay for.\" Bonus marks to anyone who spotted that on the side of a bus last year. Anyway, Andrew Sparrow's Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster today: The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has sounded a cautious note about the \u00a350bn figure. Collared by reporters in Berlin this morning, Barnier suggested that a deal wasn't agreed yet. He said: \"We are still working.....I am working for an agreement.\" The pound has rallied against \"all of its 16 major\" rival currencies this morning, reports Bloomberg. Even if a \u00a350bn bill is agreed, Britain faces several hurdles to jump before it can avoid a disorderly Brexit. As well as the Irish question, Brussels also wants commitments on EU citizen rights beyond 2019. Plus, we don't know that parliament will approve a hefty divorce bill. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital says: First, can Theresa May sell this to voters and to her party. She seems to have some shaky consensus backing for a higher offer but this is contingent on getting a good trade deal - the EU will not have its hands tied in this way. Therefore we must be wary that the political consensus to pay a bigger bill could unravel; and paying a big bill does not by definition lead to a good trade deal. Capitulating to the EU in this regard carries its own risks for Theresa May, but the risk of a no-deal exit was ultimately too high. Second, the Irish border is still a major stumbling block and it is uncertain whether sufficient progress has been made on this front. This is an even more sensitive topic than the divorce bill and is not as easy to solve with a bigger cheque. The third key barrier for the EU is citizens' rights and again it is unclear if there is sufficient progress in this regard. Sterling has jumped by 1.4% against a basket of currencies, its biggest rise since April, according to Reuters data. Christmas has come early for Brussels, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank wryly. He expects an official agreement on the Brexit bill next month, following the news that the UK has caved in to demands for a \u00a350bn payment. We expect UK PM Theresa May to present a formal offer on the Brexit bill, EU citizens rights, and the Irish border question at the upcoming 4 December dinner between May and EU Commission president Juncker. We expect the offer to meet the EU's requirement for 'sufficient progress' on the Brexit divorce. If such progress is made, expect the UK and the EU to move negotiations on to potential transitional arrangements and post-Brexit trade at the 14-15 December EU Summit. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you'd expect, there's an at-a-glance agenda of the day's main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain's exit bill is only one part of the Brexit puzzle, of course. We still don't have any idea how the Irish border question will be resolved; Dublin could block negotiations on trade unless its fears over a hard border are assuaged. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Picking up the Brexit bill has been the very thorny issue since day one and given that now the government has agreed to a respectable amount, the talks between the UK and the EU (which are set to resume next month) should be smoother. If the EU accepts the bill, then we will be moving to the next hurdle which is securing the EU rights [of citizens living in the UK. It is important to keep in mind that we are no way close to be out of the woods when it comes to the smooth negotiation process because the Northern Ireland issue is still the thorny matter. The pound is continuing to climb against the US dollar as investors bet that the Brexit fog is clearing. As Stephen Gallo at the Bank of Montreal put it (via the FT): It's a buy! The risk of snap election is down, the risk of a 'hard Brexit' is down, the path to a transition deal is clearing. The surge in the pound has hit shares in the City. The FTSE 100 is down 31 points at 7429; a stronger sterling reduces the value of money earned overseas by UK-based multinationals. The prospect that Britain and the EU might shake hands on a Brexit bill next month is exciting the City this morning. \u00a350bn is obviously a lot of money, even if split over many years. But traders think it could be worth it, if it opens the door to trade talks. Konstantinos Anthis of brokerage firm ADS Securities explains: Even though the agreement is not yet formal traders are clearly excited by the prospect of progress on this issue. Traders are looking for any positive news in this area as it opens the way for trade negotiations, and are prepared to buy sterling in response. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Sterling is on a roll this morning, amid signs that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit breakthrough. The pound has jumped to $1.3406, up almost three quarters of a cent, to its highest level since the end of September. It is also pushing higher against the euro, up 0.3% at (EURO)1.13. The rally was triggered by reports that London could pay a \u00a350bn exit bill, in an attempt to nudge European politicians into starting negotiations about trade. A deal would ease fears that Britain could crash out of the EU in March 2019 in a disorderly Brexit. EU leaders will decide next month whether this is enough to move negotiations onto trade, so this could be a very significant moment. As my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin reported last night: Non-stop behind-the-scenes negotiations have led to a broad agreement by the UK to a gross financial settlement of \u00a389bn on leaving the bloc, although the British expect the final net bill to be half as much. A senior EU official told the Guardian that the UK appeared ready to honour its share of the EU's unpaid bills, loans, pension and other liabilities accrued over 44 years of membership. \"We have heard the UK wants to come along with the money,\" the official said. \"We have understood it covers the liabilities and what we consider the real commitments. But we have to see the fine print.\" The bill could total \u00a353bn to \u00a358bn ((EURO)60bn to (EURO)65bn), although EU officials are not discussing numbers and the British government will fight hard to bring the total down.

They are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in, rather than the raw sugar needed to keep U.S. mills running.</p><p>The final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years-long dispute over Mexican access to the highly regulated US\u00a0sugar market, which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers.</p><p>The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers.</p><p>The Trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with Canada before starting full-scale negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. An industry rarely objects to a government-negotiated settlement of its anti-dumping case, and US\u00a0sugar producers could do little to stop the Commerce Department from implementing a final deal after a two-week comment period, said Seattle-based trade lawyer William Perry, who previously worked at Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission.</p><p>While the industry could ask the International Trade Commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty orders issued in 2014, chances for success look slim. The panel in 2015 rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous U.S.-Mexico pact.</p><p>Report from Reuters</p><p>6:00PMMarket wrap: Who were the winners and losers?</p><p>British engineer Babcock bore the brunt of a stunning election upset as analysts in the City warned the result raised the chances of a slowdown in new orders.</p><p>The FTSE 100 stock plunged to a seven-week low of 873p in intraday trade after broker Stifel downgraded its rating to \"hold\" citing \"a decidedly more uncertain political climate\". The broker believes a coalition government will \"inevitably\" delay initiatives and bidding processes at all levels of government. Analyst Caroline La Soujeole said: \"The main driver of the share price is order flow but we expect a prolonged hiatus across the government and civil service to impact this.\" Shares closed down 26.5p, or 2.9pc, at 882.5p.</p><p>Babcock</p><p>Taylor Wimpey was the biggest election casualty, down 6p at 177.5p, on fears the result will weigh on the UK's economic outlook. Its peer Barratt Development lost 13.5p to 576.5p, Persimmon fell 32p to \u00a323.79, and Crest Nicholson dropped 31.5p to 579p. However, Anthony Codling, of Jefferies, said: \"Share prices overreacted follow the UK's EU referendum and we would buy UK housebuilders on weakness today, next week and the week after that.\"</p><p>Taylor Wimpey</p><p>Royal Bank of Scotland also recoiled, down 6.3p to 250.9p, as analysts warned the election outcome was \"bad news\" for banks. Bernstein cautioned: \"It will be a weak government leading UK into Brexit negotiations - the single biggest tail risk for the economy and that can't be good news for the banks.\" Lloyds fell 0.7p to 70p.</p><p>Retailers Marks &amp; Spencers and Next nursed losses of 6.6p and 76p, respectively, amid fears heightened political uncertainty would translate to weaker consumer confidence. Leisure stocks also suffered from a post-election hangover, as Greene King slipped 9.5p to 711.5p and JD Wetherspoons lost 31p to 969p.</p><p>Elsewhere, fears a coalition government could delay a regulatory review of the gaming industry hurt bookmakers. William Hill fell 7.1p at 277.9p and Ladbrokes shed 2.4p to 115.8p.</p><p>On the wider market, the blue chip index charged higher, buoyed by pound weakness. With 60pc of FTSE 100 revenues coming from outside the UK, a weaker pound supports export-oriented companies.

Labour's popularity has shown that the public is unhappy with the fiscal tightening plans proposed by the Tory government.

Apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e rocambolesque, marqu\u00e9e par la multiplication des enqu\u00eates antitrust et la persistance de leur toute-puissance boursi\u00e8re, les Google, Apple, Facebook et Amazon ont du pain sur la planche. Attaqu\u00e9s de toutes parts, ils vont notamment devoir r\u00e9pondre de leur pr\u00e9dominance sur le march\u00e9 publicitaire ou encore \u00e0 la controverse sur l'utilisation des donn\u00e9es personnelles. Tour en douze questions des principaux enjeux de cette ann\u00e9e.</p><h>O\u00f9 en sont les enqu\u00eates sur les Gafa ?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">L'ann\u00e9e 2019 aura vu les enqu\u00eates se multiplier pour les Gafa. La plupart seront longues et elles s'annoncent acharn\u00e9es. Les g\u00e9ants de la tech ont renforc\u00e9 leurs \u00e9quipes juridiques et sont d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'une arm\u00e9e de lobbyistes, d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s \u00e0 Washington, \u00e0 Bruxelles et dans les principales capitales mondiales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mais le climat a clairement chang\u00e9, en particulier dans la classe politique am\u00e9ricaine, et les fronts se sont multipli\u00e9s. R\u00e9cemment, le pr\u00e9sident de la Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a confirm\u00e9 qu'il menait plusieurs enqu\u00eates, en plus de celle, d\u00e9j\u00e0 annonc\u00e9e, concernant Facebook - qui pourrait chercher \u00e0 bloquer l'int\u00e9gration des diff\u00e9rentes applications, Facebook, Instagram et WhatsApp. Il n'a pas cit\u00e9 de noms, mais il s'agit de \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">plates-formes aux activit\u00e9s multiples, soup\u00e7onn\u00e9es de pratiques ill\u00e9gales et dont les acquisitions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par les autorit\u00e9s de r\u00e9gulation</emphasis>\u00bb...</p><p>Aux Etats-Unis, le D\u00e9partement de la Justice a aussi entre les mains le dossier Facebook. Le secr\u00e9taire \u00e0 la Justice, William Barr, a indiqu\u00e9 que le passage en revue des activit\u00e9s concernerait des sujets diff\u00e9rents de ceux \u00e9tudi\u00e9s par la FTC. Et le Congr\u00e8s a mis en place ses propres commissions d'enqu\u00eate sur les Gafa...</p><p>Des proc\u00e9dures encore diff\u00e9rentes de celles men\u00e9es au niveau des Etats. Cinquante procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, repr\u00e9sentant 48 Etats, se sont en effet regroup\u00e9s pour chercher \u00e0 savoir si Google et Facebook ont viol\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles sur la concurrence aux Etats-Unis. Le Texas, qui m\u00e8ne l'enqu\u00eate sur Google, a r\u00e9cemment indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tendait son enqu\u00eate, jusqu'ici cantonn\u00e9e aux activit\u00e9s publicitaires du g\u00e9ant, \u00e0 Android et au moteur de recherche. L'Etat de New York, qui dirige celle sur Facebook, n'exclut pas de s'int\u00e9resser \u00e9galement \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.</p><p>Des pr\u00e9occupations partag\u00e9es par l'Europe : Bruxelles vient de lancer une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire sur la collecte et la mon\u00e9tisation des donn\u00e9es des utilisateurs de Google.</p><h>Les Gafa seront-ils d\u00e9mantel\u00e9s ?</h><p>L'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de novembre prochain aux Etats-Unis donne des sueurs froides \u00e0 certains acteurs de la Tech. La d\u00e9mocrate Elizabeth Warren a notamment jug\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">temps de d\u00e9manteler Google, Amazon et Facebook </emphasis>\u00bb. Elle conteste leur emprise sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mais juge aussi que leur poids nuit d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 l'\u00e9mergence de nouveaux acteurs innovants.</p><p>Sa proposition : s\u00e9parer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'outil technique et son usage quand un groupe d\u00e9passe 25 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires. Donald Trump lui-m\u00eame assure ne pas \u00eatre tr\u00e8s fan des Gafa, mais il les d\u00e9fend dans leur combat fiscal contre la France et n'a pas l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 pour limiter leur influence. Joe Biden, en t\u00eate des sondages pour l'investiture d\u00e9mocrate, a pour l'instant surtout critiqu\u00e9 - parce qu'il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime - les fausses publicit\u00e9s diffus\u00e9es sans contr\u00f4le par Facebook.</p><p>Plus que le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement, c'est une r\u00e9gulation plus serr\u00e9e que les Gafa peuvent craindre, avec de multiples entr\u00e9es possibles : la concurrence d\u00e9loyale (quand Apple ou Amazon privil\u00e9gient leurs services \u00e0 partir de leurs produits ou de leur plate-forme), la protection et le partage des donn\u00e9es personnelles ou encore la r\u00e9glementation publicitaire, qui reste le coeur des revenus de Google et Facebook.</p><h>Lire aussi :</h><p>Face aux Gafa, la n\u00e9cessaire refonte des lois antitrust</p><h>Qui aura la meilleure part du g\u00e2teau publicitaire ?</h><p>Plut\u00f4t que des Gafa, il faut surtout parler de Google et de Facebook quand il s'agit de mesurer le poids de ces acteurs dans les recettes publicitaires. Google a pass\u00e9 la barre des 40 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires au troisi\u00e8me trimestre, dont 83 % dans la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique, et Facebook 18 milliards de dollars de revenus en un trimestre. Selon l'institut Warc, les deux acteurs ont capt\u00e9 l'an dernier 56 % de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique mondiale, un chiffre qui pourrait grimper \u00e0 61 % cette ann\u00e9e. Rapport\u00e9e au march\u00e9 total de la publicit\u00e9 - en ligne et traditionnelle -, leur part \u00e9tait encore de pr\u00e8s de 25 % l'an dernier.</p><p>Google et Facebook voient d\u00e9sormais entrer sur leur terrain de jeu Amazon. La plate-forme, qui profite de ses places de march\u00e9 et de sa connaissance fine des consommateurs pour envoyer des messages cibl\u00e9s, pourrait capter 10 milliards de dollars de recettes publicitaires sur le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain cette ann\u00e9e, soit pr\u00e8s de 8 % du march\u00e9, selon une \u00e9tude de e-marketer.</p><p>Les grandes plates-formes risquent donc de continuer \u00e0 prendre des parts de march\u00e9 sur les acteurs historiques que sont notamment les \u00e9diteurs de presse et la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision. Et les tentatives de r\u00e9gulation et de partage des revenus se sont pour l'instant heurt\u00e9es \u00e0 un mur. Comme avec la \u00ab taxe Gafa \u00bb sur le chiffre d'affaires des grandes plates-formes, la France, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 avoir transpos\u00e9 la directive europ\u00e9enne sur le droit voisin pour la presse, esp\u00e8re faire reconna\u00eetre un abus de position dominante de Google et parvenir \u00e0 un accord.</p><h>Ont-ils gagn\u00e9 la bataille du cloud ?</h><p>La tortue europ\u00e9enne peut-elle rattraper le li\u00e8vre am\u00e9ricain ? Dans le domaine des infrastructures informatiques \u00e0 la demande, la fable a peu de chances de se terminer comme dans la version originale. Les trois g\u00e9ants du cloud - Amazon, Microsoft et Google - ont pris dix ans d'avance sur la concurrence.</p><p>Le premier a invent\u00e9 le concept avec sa filiale AWS cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 2006. Il contr\u00f4le aujourd'hui plus du tiers de ce fabuleux march\u00e9, \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 100 milliards de dollars en 2019, et en croissance de 40 % par an. Son premier poursuivant, Microsoft Azure, est deux fois plus petit. Google Cloud quatre fois. A eux trois, c'est plus de la moiti\u00e9 du g\u00e2teau mondial du cloud. Avec les profits, mais aussi les innovations et les \u00e9conomies d'\u00e9chelle qui vont avec. A c\u00f4t\u00e9, le champion tricolore OVH, avec ses 600 millions d'euros de revenus attendus en 2019 - soit moins de 1 % du march\u00e9 mondial -, p\u00e8se tr\u00e8s peu.</p><h>Lire aussi :</h><p>Gaia-X : un cloud europ\u00e9en tr\u00e8s allemand... et am\u00e9ricain</p><p>Les seuls \u00e0 pouvoir faire un peu d'ombre \u00e0 l'Oncle Sam, ce sont les g\u00e9ants chinois du cloud : Alibaba et Tencent. Ce dernier vient d'annoncer un investissement de plus de 10 milliards d'euros dans ses infrastructures cloud en Europe. Et en a profit\u00e9 pour expliquer aux autorit\u00e9s du Vieux Continent que la comp\u00e9tition mondiale \u00e9tait \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">largement pass\u00e9e</emphasis>\u00bb.</p><p>L'Europe a pourtant encore des ambitions, dop\u00e9es par les inqui\u00e9tudes sur la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles ou industrielles. La France sonde ainsi les industriels tricolores pour b\u00e2tir un \u00ab cloud de confiance \u00bb, sept ans apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9chec fracassant des \u00ab clouds souverains \u00bb Numergy et Cloudwatt. L'Allemagne pousse un \u00ab cloud europ\u00e9en \u00bb baptis\u00e9 Gaia-X. La volont\u00e9 politique suffira-t-elle ? Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, la possibilit\u00e9, voire l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, de concurrencer le GPS am\u00e9ricain avec Galileo paraissait mince. Et pourtant il tourne...</p><h>Les banques vont-elles dispara\u00eetre au profit des Gafa ?</h><p>Apple, qui vient de lancer une carte bancaire avec Goldman Sachs, Google, qui se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 proposer un compte courant avec Citigroup l'an prochain... Depuis leur entr\u00e9e sur le march\u00e9 des moyens de paiement avec Apple Pay ou Google Pay, les Gafa misent sur le secteur bancaire pour se diversifier. Certains ont m\u00eame des ambitions plus grandes, comme Facebook qui avait r\u00e9uni une palette de partenaires bancaires pour lancer une cryptomonnaie, le Libra.</p><p>L'offensive de Facebook sur un sujet \u00e9minemment souverain a finalement d\u00e9clench\u00e9 plus de craintes que d'admiration, au moment o\u00f9 Mark Zuckerberg est la cible de critiques tous azimuts de la part des r\u00e9gulateurs et des parlementaires. R\u00e9sultat, le projet de Libra est regard\u00e9 avec circonspection et les partenaires bancaires sont partis un \u00e0 un.</p><p>\u00abLe Libra, c'est pour l'instant surtout une id\u00e9e<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mais cela a forc\u00e9 les r\u00e9gulateurs \u00e0 se poser \u00e0 nouveau la question de ce qu'est une banque</emphasis>\u00bb, jugeait r\u00e9cemment un banquier am\u00e9ricain. D\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre, un rapport des superviseurs du G20 f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le Conseil de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re (FSB) a point\u00e9 les risques que fait peser la \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb - avec des acteurs peu nombreux et ma\u00eetres du cloud - sur les performances des banques traditionnelles, et donc in fine sur la stabilit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me financier.</p><h>La sant\u00e9, nouvel eldorado des Gafa?</h><p>Partenariat avec plusieurs laboratoires pharmaceutiques pour am\u00e9liorer les essais cliniques, cr\u00e9ation de nouvelles divisions d\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 dirig\u00e9es par des professeurs de m\u00e9decine r\u00e9put\u00e9s, ouverture de cliniques pour leurs salari\u00e9s... En 2019, les Gafa ont multipli\u00e9 les annonces dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9, un march\u00e9 fragment\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant un cinqui\u00e8me du PIB des Etats-Unis qu'ils veulent disrupter.</p><p>La r\u00e9v\u00e9lation en novembre par le \u00ab Wall Street Journal \u00bb du projet Nightingale de Google a confirm\u00e9 le niveau de leurs ambitions dans ce domaine. Ascension Health, le deuxi\u00e8me plus gros gestionnaire d'h\u00f4pitaux des Etats-Unis, a pass\u00e9 un partenariat avec le g\u00e9ant de Mountain View pour transf\u00e9rer les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de plus de 50 millions de patients vers ses serveurs informatiques. Objectif ? Sugg\u00e9rer des traitements aux m\u00e9decins en appliquant ses outils d'intelligence artificielle aux donn\u00e9es.</p><p>La nouvelle a suivi de peu l'annonce de son offre de rachat de Fitbit, le fabricant de bracelets connect\u00e9s dont les derni\u00e8res versions permettent de surveiller son sommeil et son rythme cardiaque. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne veut pas se laisser distancer par Apple, qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 positionn\u00e9 sa montre connect\u00e9e comme appareil pr\u00e9ventif. Depuis l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, deux des plus gros assureurs am\u00e9ricains subventionnent les Apple Watch. Le g\u00e9ant \u00e0 la pomme pourrait aller plus loin cette ann\u00e9e avec des appareils mesurant le taux de glucose. Reste un mur \u00e0 franchir : la surveillance accrue des r\u00e9gulateurs et la d\u00e9fiance des patients \u00e0 la suite des diff\u00e9rents scandales sur leurs traitements des donn\u00e9es.</p><h>Fiscalit\u00e9 du num\u00e9rique : jusqu'o\u00f9 ira le duel Washington-Paris ?</h><p>Tout est \u00e0 refaire, ou presque. Alors que les n\u00e9gociations semblaient avancer \u00e0 l'OCDE, Paris et Washington ont connu un automne br\u00fblant. L'administration Trump avait pourtant donn\u00e9 des signaux positifs, envisageant une solution concert\u00e9e au niveau international et adoubant les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par l'OCDE (taxation des activit\u00e9s dans un pays m\u00eame si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a pas de pr\u00e9sence physique, d\u00e9finition d'un taux minimum d'imp\u00f4t sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s...).</p><p>Mais depuis, elle a fait volte-face et fait savoir \u00e0 ses partenaires que, pour elle, ces mesures ne pouvaient \u00eatre que... facultatives. Et en attendant qu'une solution soit trouv\u00e9e, qui remplacerait la taxe Gafa adopt\u00e9e en France, Washington a annonc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles, qui pourraient taxer jusqu'\u00e0 100 % des fromages fran\u00e7ais, du champagne, etc. Un arsenal soumis \u00e0 une consultation publique jusqu'au 14 janvier.</p><p>Dans l'imm\u00e9diat, les grandes plates-formes vont devoir s'acquitter des taxes en France. Elles pourraient \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es si une solution internationale \u00e9tait adopt\u00e9e et que cet imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la taxe fran\u00e7aise. Mais, pour cela, il faudra se rasseoir \u00e0 la table des n\u00e9gociations...</p><p>En attendant, Google a annonc\u00e9 cette semaine qu'il arr\u00eaterait d'utiliser un m\u00e9canisme d'optimisation fiscale \u00ab Double Irish, Double Dutch sandwich \u00bb qui lui permettait de repousser le paiement de ses imp\u00f4ts aux Etats-Unis. Washington avait exhort\u00e9 les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui y avaient recours \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 cette pratique avant 2020.</p><h>Lire aussi :</h><p>Une vingtaine d'entreprises paieront la taxe Gafa en France</p><h>Les salari\u00e9s des Gafa vont-ils suivre ou se rebeller ?</h><p>Ramener les entreprises technologiques dans le droit chemin : c'est la mission que se fixe un nombre croissant de salari\u00e9s des Gafa. Longtemps apathiques, quelques milliers d'entre eux multiplient d\u00e9sormais les manifestations et lettres ouvertes pour protester contre les pratiques internes et les choix strat\u00e9giques de leurs employeurs. Une douzaine est m\u00eame all\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9missionner.</p><p>La mobilisation est particuli\u00e8rement forte chez Google, entreprise qui a toujours encourag\u00e9 ses salari\u00e9s \u00e0 exprimer leurs opinions. Apr\u00e8s la manifestation d'un quart des effectifs du groupe en novembre 2018 \u00e0 la suite du traitement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux de dirigeants accus\u00e9s de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, leur activisme a permis d'am\u00e9liorer les conditions de travail des int\u00e9rimaires, de stopper la fourniture d'outils d'intelligence artificielle au Pentagone et de mettre fin \u00e0 un projet de retour du moteur de recherche en Chine.</p><p>Le g\u00e9ant de Mountain View cherche d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 torpiller une mobilisation qui ne faiblit pas. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9duit l'acc\u00e8s des \u00ab Googlers \u00bb aux documents ne les concernant pas directement, il a diminu\u00e9 le champ et la fr\u00e9quence des r\u00e9unions permettant aux salari\u00e9s d'interroger la direction puis licenci\u00e9 cinq salari\u00e9s activistes au cours des deux derniers mois. Reste \u00e0 voir si cela sera suffisant pour \u00e9touffer un mouvement qui, s'il reste limit\u00e9 \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s, est de plus en plus vocal. Et si cette r\u00e9sistance ne va pas plut\u00f4t pousser les activistes \u00e0 former un v\u00e9ritable syndicat.</p><h>Lire aussi :</h><p>Les Gafa au bord du gouffre de la haine</p><h>Quel sera leur parcours boursier ?</h><p>Malgr\u00e9 les enqu\u00eates qui se multiplient, malgr\u00e9 la guerre commerciale qui les a s\u00e9rieusement menac\u00e9s, les Gafa ont battu des records boursiers en 2019, dans le sillage d'un Nasdaq qui a gagn\u00e9 36 % en un an. Amazon a gagn\u00e9 23 %, Alphabet 28 %, Facebook s'est envol\u00e9 de 56 % et Apple de 85 % ! Ce dernier a engrang\u00e9 plus de 530 milliards de capitalisation boursi\u00e8re en douze mois. Les march\u00e9s ont salu\u00e9 leurs r\u00e9sultats, port\u00e9s par le contexte \u00e9conomique favorable aux Etats-Unis. Difficile, a priori, de faire mieux en 2020, alors que Wall Street pourrait h\u00e9siter face aux incertitudes internationales et se montrer relativement attentiste jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle am\u00e9ricaine.</p><p>Les analystes s'attendent n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 voir Apple franchir all\u00e8grement la barre des 300 dollars \u00e0 la Bourse de New York, port\u00e9 par les ventes de ses accessoires lors des f\u00eates de fin d'ann\u00e9e. Ceux-ci (les AirPods et les Apple Watch notamment) pourraient doper les r\u00e9sultats du quatri\u00e8me trimestre.</p><p>Les voyants sont aussi au vert pour Facebook.

Derri\u00e8re cet acronyme se cachent Baidu (moteur de recherche et voiture autonome), Alibaba (e-commerce et paiement mobile), Tencent (r\u00e9seaux sociaux et jeux vid\u00e9o) et Xiaomi, le quatri\u00e8me fabricant mondial de smartphones.</p><p>Les quatre g\u00e9ants chinois sont les seules entreprises au monde \u00e0 avoir l'\u00e9chelle et la puissance de frappe financi\u00e8re pour rivaliser avec les Gafa am\u00e9ricains. Avec 1,1 milliard d'utilisateurs sur sa messagerie WeChat, Tencent talonne Facebook (2,4 milliards de personnes) et sa capitalisation boursi\u00e8re fait des grands pas (458 milliards de dollars contre 585 milliards pour Facebook). Comme les Gafa, les BATX ont aussi enclench\u00e9 un \u00e9norme mouvement de diversification (vers la voiture autonome, les contenus, l'intelligence artificielle...) fond\u00e9 sur la croissance externe. Leur m\u00e9thode privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e de d\u00e9veloppement reste en effet les acquisitions, tandis que sur ce terrain les Gafa am\u00e9ricains sont plus prudents.</p><p>De plus en plus pr\u00e9sents en Europe, \u00e0 l'image de Tencent qui vient de racheter 10 % du capital du fran\u00e7ais Universal Music, les BATX le sont toutefois encore peu aux Etats-Unis, en raison de la m\u00e9fiance qu'ils suscitent, particuli\u00e8rement depuis l'arriv\u00e9e de Donald Trump \u00e0 la Maison Blanche.</p><p>A ce stade, seule TikTok, l'application de vid\u00e9os \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8res du chinois ByteDance, a fait une perc\u00e9e fulgurante. Plus de 26 millions d'Am\u00e9ricains utilisent la plate-forme, dont 60 % ont entre 16 et 24 ans, selon les chiffres officiels. Mieux, en 2018, TikTok a \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9e dans le pays que Facebook, Instagram ou Snapchat.</p><h>Quels progr\u00e8s peut-on attendre sur la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e ?</h><p>C'est la question explosive qui a fait tomber Facebook de son pi\u00e9destal et forc\u00e9 Mark Zuckerberg \u00e0 multiplier les actes de contrition apr\u00e8s le scandale Cambridge Analytica. Comment emp\u00eacher les donn\u00e9es personnelles des internautes d'\u00eatre amass\u00e9es, redistribu\u00e9es et utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers pour des motifs parfois peu avouables ? C'est tout le mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique d'Internet - et de Google et Facebook en premier lieu - qui est en question.</p><p>Une pseudo-gratuit\u00e9 o\u00f9, pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des services de grande qualit\u00e9 devenus parfois quasi indispensables, il faut accepter d'\u00eatre pist\u00e9 en permanence. Ce que Shoshana Zuboff r\u00e9sume par le titre de son r\u00e9cent ouvrage : \u00ab L'\u00e2ge du capitalisme de surveillance \u00bb. O\u00f9 je suis, qui je contacte, qu'est-ce que j'aime... quantit\u00e9 d'informations peuvent dresser un portrait unique et extr\u00eamement pr\u00e9cis d'un individu.</p><p>\u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Les 'J'aime' sur Facebook permettent de d\u00e9duire l'orientation sexuelle avec une pr\u00e9cision de 88 %</emphasis>\u00bb, note l'Institut Montaigne dans une r\u00e9cente \u00e9tude sur l'insuffisante protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles. De quoi faire le bonheur des annonceurs... mais aussi le miel des services d'espionnage, le lit des fake news et le malheur de la d\u00e9mocratie.</p><p>Une prise de conscience s'amorce. Facebook comme Google offrent des outils aux utilisateurs pour g\u00e9rer leurs informations personnelles. Apple fait de la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e un argument marketing phare, m\u00eame s'il ne peut pas contr\u00f4ler toutes les donn\u00e9es personnelles exfiltr\u00e9es par les applications mobiles pour iPhone. L'Europe, suivie par la Californie ou l'Inde, a durci son cadre l\u00e9gal avec le RGPD.</p><p>Est-ce suffisant ? Certains plaident pour un renforcement drastique de ces garde-fous. Mais certainement pas les Gafa. Les mauvaises pratiques de Facebook en mati\u00e8re de respect de la vie priv\u00e9e lui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 valu 5 milliards de dollars d'amende aux Etats-Unis l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier. Un cadre plus restrictif sur le pistage des internautes co\u00fbterait autrement plus cher \u00e0 la tech am\u00e9ricaine.</p><h>Quelles sont les grandes innovations attendues en 2020 ?</h><p>En 2020, les Gafa vont devoir r\u00e9affirmer leur capacit\u00e9 d'innovation, parfois \u00ab folle \u00bb, dans tous les domaines. Voiture autonome, cerveau connect\u00e9, conqu\u00eate de l'espace, r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle... sont autant de chantiers.</p><p>Entre eux, c'est \u00e0 celui qui surprendra le plus avec une innovation hors norme. Facebook cherche carr\u00e9ment \u00e0 supprimer la commande manuelle des smartphones et des ordinateurs, avec, \u00e0 terme, un bracelet d\u00e9codant l'activit\u00e9 des neurones en signaux num\u00e9riques. La simple intention de poster une photo sur Instagram... suffirait \u00e0 d\u00e9clencher l'action !</p><p>Google lui met les bouch\u00e9es doubles sur la voiture autonome, apr\u00e8s l'acquisition d'une start-up britannique qui apprend aux machines \u00e0 r\u00e9pliquer le comportement des humains. Le g\u00e9ant de Mountain View esp\u00e8re ainsi am\u00e9liorer la r\u00e9action de ses v\u00e9hicules autonomes en cas d'\u00e9v\u00e9nement impr\u00e9vu, par exemple lorsqu'un pi\u00e9ton traverse subitement la rue.</p><p>Amazon, pour sa part, a promis de lancer \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dans les prochains mois</emphasis>\u00bb son nouveau drone autonome et \u00e9lectrique, Prime Air, qui pourra livrer les colis aux clients situ\u00e9s dans un rayon de 24 kilom\u00e8tres en seulement...une demie-heure.</p><p>Apple travaille sur un casque de r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e, alors que l'entreprise se renforce dans les jeux vid\u00e9os avec Arcade et les contenus avec Apple TV+. L'app\u00e9tit d'Apple pour la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e est devenu encore plus manifeste fin 2019 avec le rachat de la start-up Ikinema, son huiti\u00e8me rachat dans ce secteur au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.</p><p>Il faut aussi s'attendre \u00e0 des prouesses c\u00f4t\u00e9 puissance de calcul. Google a ainsi revendiqu\u00e9 avoir atteint la \u00ab supr\u00e9matie quantique \u00bb en mettant au point un algorithme qu'un ordinateur classique est incapable de faire tourner, provoquant un bras de fer avec IBM, qui conteste l'avanc\u00e9e de son concurrent.</p><p>La maison du futur devrait aussi \u00eatre un enjeu important. Mouvement fort dans ce secteur o\u00f9 les Gafa ont longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 rivaux avec des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes concurrents (Assistant pour Google, Siri chez Apple et Alexa c\u00f4t\u00e9 Amazon) : les trois g\u00e9ants viennent de faire la paix pour \u00e9laborer d'ici \u00e0 la fin 2020 un protocole commun. Objectif : pouvoir piloter les diff\u00e9rents objets connect\u00e9s de la maison depuis n'importe quelle interface, et supprimer ainsi les probl\u00e8mes actuels d'incompatibilit\u00e9, dans ce secteur en pleine explosion.

Apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e rocambolesque, marqu\u00e9e par la multiplication des enqu\u00eates antitrust et la persistance de leur toute-puissance boursi\u00e8re, les Google, Apple, Facebook et Amazon ont du pain sur la planche. Attaqu\u00e9s de toutes parts, ils vont notamment devoir r\u00e9pondre de leur pr\u00e9dominance sur le march\u00e9 publicitaire ou encore \u00e0 la controverse sur l'utilisation des donn\u00e9es personnelles. Alors qu'ils font face pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 une r\u00e9bellion croissante de leurs salari\u00e9s, ils doivent r\u00e9affirmer leur capacit\u00e9 d'innovation dans tous les domaines, de la banque \u00e0 la sant\u00e9, en passant par la voiture.</p><h>O\u00f9 en sont les enqu\u00eates sur les Gafa ?</h><p>L'ann\u00e9e 2019 aura vu les enqu\u00eates se multiplier pour les Gafa. La plupart seront longues et elles s'annoncent acharn\u00e9es. Les g\u00e9ants de la tech ont renforc\u00e9 leurs \u00e9quipes juridiques et sont d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'une arm\u00e9e de lobbyistes, d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s \u00e0 Washington, \u00e0 Bruxelles et dans les principales capitales mondiales. Mais le climat a clairement chang\u00e9, en particulier dans la classe politique am\u00e9ricaine, et les fronts se sont multipli\u00e9s. R\u00e9cemment, le pr\u00e9sident de la Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a confirm\u00e9 qu'il menait plusieurs enqu\u00eates, en plus de celle, d\u00e9j\u00e0 annonc\u00e9e, concernant Facebook - qui pourrait chercher \u00e0 bloquer l'int\u00e9gration des diff\u00e9rentes applications, Facebook, Instagram et WhatsApp. Il n'a pas cit\u00e9 de noms, mais il s'agit de<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00ab plates-formes aux activit\u00e9s multiples, soup\u00e7onn\u00e9es de pratiques ill\u00e9gales et dont les acquisitions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par les autorit\u00e9s de r\u00e9gulation \u00bb</emphasis>...</p><p>Aux Etats-Unis, le d\u00e9partement de la Justice a aussi entre les mains le dossier Facebook. Le secr\u00e9taire \u00e0 la Justice, William Barr, a indiqu\u00e9 que le passage en revue des activit\u00e9s concernerait des sujets diff\u00e9rents de ceux \u00e9tudi\u00e9s par la FTC. Et le Congr\u00e8s a mis en place ses propres commissions d'enqu\u00eate sur les Gafa... Des proc\u00e9dures encore diff\u00e9rentes de celles men\u00e9es au niveau des Etats. Cinquante procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, repr\u00e9sentant 48 Etats, se sont en effet regroup\u00e9s pour chercher \u00e0 savoir si Google et Facebook ont viol\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles sur la concurrence aux Etats-Unis. Le Texas, qui m\u00e8ne l'enqu\u00eate sur Google, a r\u00e9cemment indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tendait son enqu\u00eate, jusqu'ici cantonn\u00e9e aux activit\u00e9s publicitaires du g\u00e9ant, \u00e0 Android et au moteur de recherche. L'Etat de New York, qui dirige celle sur Facebook, n'exclut pas de s'int\u00e9resser \u00e9galement \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.</p><p>Des pr\u00e9occupations partag\u00e9es par l'Europe : Bruxelles vient de lancer une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire sur la collecte et la mon\u00e9tisation des donn\u00e9es des utilisateurs de Google.</p><h>Les Gafa seront-ils d\u00e9mantel\u00e9s ?</h><p>L'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de novembre prochain aux Etats-Unis donne des sueurs froides \u00e0 certains acteurs de la tech. La d\u00e9mocrate Elizabeth Warren a notamment jug\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">temps de d\u00e9manteler Google, Amazon et Facebook </emphasis>\u00bb. Elle conteste leur emprise sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mais juge aussi que leur poids nuit d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 l'\u00e9mergence de nouveaux acteurs innovants. Sa proposition : s\u00e9parer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'outil technique et son usage quand un groupe d\u00e9passe 25 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires. Donald Trump lui-m\u00eame assure ne pas \u00eatre tr\u00e8s fan des Gafa, mais il les d\u00e9fend dans leur combat fiscal contre la France et n'a pas l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 pour limiter leur influence. Joe Biden, en t\u00eate des sondages pour l'investiture d\u00e9mocrate, a pour l'instant surtout critiqu\u00e9 - parce qu'il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime - les fausses publicit\u00e9s diffus\u00e9es sans contr\u00f4le par Facebook.</p><p>Plus que le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement, c'est une r\u00e9gulation plus serr\u00e9e que les Gafa peuvent craindre, avec de multiples entr\u00e9es possibles : la concurrence d\u00e9loyale (quand Apple ou Amazon privil\u00e9gient leurs services \u00e0 partir de leurs produits ou de leur plate-forme), la protection et le partage des donn\u00e9es personnelles ou encore la r\u00e9glementation publicitaire, qui reste le coeur des revenus de Google et de Facebook.</p><h>Qui aura la meilleure part du g\u00e2teau publicitaire ?</h><p>Plut\u00f4t que des Gafa, il faut surtout parler de Google et de Facebook quand il s'agit de mesurer le poids de ces acteurs dans les recettes publicitaires. Google a pass\u00e9 la barre des 40 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires au troisi\u00e8me trimestre, dont 83 % dans la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique, et Facebook, 18 milliards de dollars de revenus en un trimestre. Selon l'institut WARC, les deux acteurs ont capt\u00e9 l'an dernier 56 % de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique mondiale, un chiffre qui pourrait grimper \u00e0 61 % cette ann\u00e9e. Rapport\u00e9e au march\u00e9 total de la publicit\u00e9 - en ligne et traditionnelle -, leur part \u00e9tait encore de pr\u00e8s de 25 % l'an dernier.</p><p>Google et Facebook voient d\u00e9sormais entrer sur leur terrain de jeu Amazon. La plate-forme, qui profite de ses places de march\u00e9 et de sa connaissance fine des consommateurs pour envoyer des messages cibl\u00e9s, pourrait capter 10 milliards de dollars de recettes publicitaires sur le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain cette ann\u00e9e, soit pr\u00e8s de 8 % du march\u00e9, selon une \u00e9tude d'eMarketer.</p><p>Les grandes plates-formes risquent donc de continuer \u00e0 prendre des parts de march\u00e9 sur les acteurs historiques que sont notamment les \u00e9diteurs de presse et la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision. Et les tentatives de r\u00e9gulation et de partage des revenus se sont pour l'instant heurt\u00e9es \u00e0 un mur. Comme avec la \u00ab taxe Gafa \u00bb sur le chiffre d'affaires des grandes plates-formes, la France, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 avoir transpos\u00e9 la directive europ\u00e9enne sur le droit voisin pour la presse, esp\u00e8re faire reconna\u00eetre un abus de position dominante de Google et parvenir \u00e0 un accord.</p><h>Ont-ils gagn\u00e9 la bataille du cloud ?</h><p>La tortue europ\u00e9enne peut-elle rattraper le li\u00e8vre am\u00e9ricain ? Dans le domaine des infrastructures informatiques \u00e0 la demande, la fable a peu de chances de se terminer comme dans la version originale. Les trois g\u00e9ants du cloud - Amazon, Microsoft et Google - ont pris dix ans d'avance sur la concurrence.</p><p>Le premier a invent\u00e9 le concept avec sa filiale AWS, cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 2006. Il contr\u00f4le aujourd'hui plus du tiers de ce fabuleux march\u00e9, \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 100 milliards de dollars en 2019 et en croissance de 40 % par an. Son premier poursuivant, Microsoft Azure, est deux fois plus petit. Google Cloud, quatre fois. A eux trois, c'est plus de la moiti\u00e9 du g\u00e2teau mondial du cloud. Avec les profits, mais aussi les innovations et les \u00e9conomies d'\u00e9chelle qui vont avec. A c\u00f4t\u00e9, le champion tricolore OVH, avec ses 600 millions d'euros de revenus attendus en 2019 - soit moins de 1 % du march\u00e9 mondial -, p\u00e8se tr\u00e8s peu.</p><p>Les seuls \u00e0 pouvoir faire un peu d'ombre \u00e0 l'Oncle Sam, ce sont les g\u00e9ants chinois du cloud : Alibaba et Tencent. Ce dernier vient d'annoncer un investissement de plus de 10 milliards d'euros dans ses infrastructures cloud en Europe. Et en a profit\u00e9 pour expliquer aux autorit\u00e9s du Vieux Continent que la comp\u00e9tition mondiale \u00e9tait \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">largement pass\u00e9e</emphasis>\u00bb.</p><p>L'Europe a pourtant encore des ambitions, dop\u00e9es par les inqui\u00e9tudes sur la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles ou industrielles. La France sonde ainsi les industriels tricolores pour b\u00e2tir un \u00ab cloud de confiance \u00bb, sept ans apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9chec fracassant des \u00ab clouds souverains \u00bb Numergy et Cloudwatt. L'Allemagne pousse un \u00ab cloud europ\u00e9en \u00bb baptis\u00e9 \u00ab Gaia-X \u00bb. La volont\u00e9 politique suffira-t-elle ? Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, la possibilit\u00e9, voire l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, de concurrencer le GPS am\u00e9ricain avec Galileo paraissait mince. Et pourtant il tourne...</p><h>Les banques vont-elles dispara\u00eetre au profit des Gafa ?</h><p>Apple, qui vient de lancer une carte bancaire avec Goldman Sachs, Google, qui se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 proposer un compte courant avec Citigroup l'an prochain... Depuis leur entr\u00e9e sur le march\u00e9 des moyens de paiement avec Apple Pay ou Google Pay, les Gafa misent sur le secteur bancaire pour se diversifier. Certains ont m\u00eame des ambitions plus grandes, comme Facebook, qui avait r\u00e9uni une palette de partenaires bancaires pour lancer une cryptomonnaie, le libra.</p><p>L'offensive de Facebook sur un sujet \u00e9minemment souverain a finalement d\u00e9clench\u00e9 plus de craintes que d'admiration, au moment o\u00f9 Mark Zuckerberg est la cible de critiques tous azimuts de la part des r\u00e9gulateurs et des parlementaires. R\u00e9sultat, le projet de libra est regard\u00e9 avec circonspection et les partenaires bancaires sont partis un \u00e0 un. \u00ab Le libra, c'est pour l'instant surtout une id\u00e9e,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mais cela a forc\u00e9 les r\u00e9gulateurs \u00e0 se poser \u00e0 nouveau la question de ce qu'est une banque</emphasis>\u00bb, jugeait r\u00e9cemment un banquier am\u00e9ricain. D\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre, un rapport des superviseurs du G20 f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le Conseil de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re (FSB) a point\u00e9 les risques que fait peser la \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb- avec des acteurs peu nombreux et ma\u00eetres du cloud - sur les performances des banques traditionnelles, et donc in fine sur la stabilit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me financier.</p><h>La sant\u00e9, nouvel eldorado des Gafa ?</h><p>Partenariat avec plusieurs laboratoires pharmaceutiques pour am\u00e9liorer les essais cliniques, cr\u00e9ation de nouvelles divisions d\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 dirig\u00e9es par des professeurs de m\u00e9decine r\u00e9put\u00e9s, ouverture de cliniques pour leurs salari\u00e9s... En 2019, les Gafa ont multipli\u00e9 les annonces dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9, un march\u00e9 fragment\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant un cinqui\u00e8me du PIB des Etats-Unis qu'ils veulent disrupter.</p><p>La r\u00e9v\u00e9lation en novembre par le \u00ab Wall Street Journal \u00bb du projet Nightingale de Google a confirm\u00e9 le niveau de leurs ambitions dans ce domaine. Ascension Health, le deuxi\u00e8me plus gros gestionnaire d'h\u00f4pitaux des Etats-Unis, a pass\u00e9 un partenariat avec le g\u00e9ant de Mountain View pour transf\u00e9rer les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de plus de 50 millions de patients vers ses serveurs informatiques. Objectif ? Sugg\u00e9rer des traitements aux m\u00e9decins en appliquant ses outils d'intelligence artificielle aux donn\u00e9es.</p><p>La nouvelle a suivi de peu l'annonce de son offre de rachat de Fitbit, le fabricant de bracelets connect\u00e9s dont les derni\u00e8res versions permettent de surveiller sommeil et rythme cardiaque. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne veut pas se laisser distancer par Apple, qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 positionn\u00e9 sa montre connect\u00e9e comme appareil pr\u00e9ventif. Depuis l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, deux des plus gros assureurs am\u00e9ricains subventionnent les Apple Watch. Le g\u00e9ant \u00e0 la pomme pourrait aller plus loin cette ann\u00e9e avec des appareils mesurant le taux de glucose. Reste un mur \u00e0 franchir : la surveillance accrue des r\u00e9gulateurs et la d\u00e9fiance des patients \u00e0 la suite des diff\u00e9rents scandales sur le traitement des donn\u00e9es.</p><h>Fiscalit\u00e9 du num\u00e9rique : jusqu'o\u00f9 ira le duel Washington-Paris ?</h><p>Tout est \u00e0 refaire, ou presque. Alors que les n\u00e9gociations semblaient avancer \u00e0 l'OCDE, Paris et Washington ont connu un automne br\u00fblant. L'administration Trump avait pourtant donn\u00e9 des signaux positifs, envisageant une solution concert\u00e9e au niveau international et adoubant les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par l'OCDE (taxation des activit\u00e9s dans un pays m\u00eame si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a pas de pr\u00e9sence physique, d\u00e9finition d'un taux minimum d'imp\u00f4t sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s...).</p><p>Mais, depuis, elle a fait volte-face et fait savoir \u00e0 ses partenaires que, pour elle, ces mesures ne pouvaient \u00eatre que... facultatives. Et en attendant qu'une solution soit trouv\u00e9e, qui remplacerait la taxe Gafa adopt\u00e9e en France, Washington a annonc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles qui pourraient taxer jusqu'\u00e0 100 % des fromages fran\u00e7ais, du champagne, etc. Un arsenal soumis \u00e0 une consultation publique jusqu'au 14 janvier.</p><p>Dans l'imm\u00e9diat, les grandes plates-formes vont devoir s'acquitter des taxes en France. Elles pourraient \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es si une solution internationale \u00e9tait adopt\u00e9e et si cet imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la taxe fran\u00e7aise. Mais, pour cela, il faudra se rasseoir \u00e0 la table des n\u00e9gociations... En attendant, Google a annonc\u00e9 cette semaine qu'il arr\u00eaterait d'utiliser un m\u00e9canisme d'optimisation fiscale qui lui permettait de repousser le paiement de ses imp\u00f4ts aux Etats-Unis. Washington avait exhort\u00e9 les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui y avaient recours \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 cette pratique avant 2020.</p><h>Les salari\u00e9s des Gafa vont-ils suivre ou se rebeller ?</h><p>Ramener les entreprises technologiques dans le droit chemin : c'est la mission que se fixe un nombre croissant de salari\u00e9s des Gafa. Longtemps apathiques, quelques milliers d'entre eux multiplient d\u00e9sormais les manifestations et lettres ouvertes pour protester contre les pratiques internes et les choix strat\u00e9giques de leurs employeurs. Une douzaine est m\u00eame all\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9missionner.</p><p>La mobilisation est particuli\u00e8rement forte chez Google, entreprise qui a toujours encourag\u00e9 ses salari\u00e9s \u00e0 exprimer leurs opinions. Apr\u00e8s la manifestation d'un quart des effectifs du groupe en novembre 2018 \u00e0 la suite du traitement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux de dirigeants accus\u00e9s de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, leur activisme a permis d'am\u00e9liorer les conditions de travail des int\u00e9rimaires, de stopper la fourniture d'outils d'intelligence artificielle au Pentagone et de mettre fin \u00e0 un projet de retour du moteur de recherche en Chine.</p><p>Le g\u00e9ant de Mountain View cherche d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 torpiller une mobilisation qui ne faiblit pas. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9duit l'acc\u00e8s des \u00ab googlers \u00bb aux documents ne les concernant pas directement, il a diminu\u00e9 le champ et la fr\u00e9quence des r\u00e9unions permettant aux salari\u00e9s d'interroger la direction puis a licenci\u00e9 cinq salari\u00e9s activistes au cours des deux derniers mois. Reste \u00e0 voir si cela sera suffisant pour \u00e9touffer un mouvement qui, s'il reste limit\u00e9 \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s, prend de plus en plus d'ampleur. Et si cette r\u00e9sistance ne va pas plut\u00f4t pousser les activistes \u00e0 former un v\u00e9ritable syndicat.</p><h>Quel sera leur parcours boursier ?</h><p>Malgr\u00e9 les enqu\u00eates qui se multiplient, malgr\u00e9 la guerre commerciale qui les a s\u00e9rieusement menac\u00e9s, les Gafa ont battu des records boursiers en 2019, dans le sillage d'un Nasdaq qui a gagn\u00e9 36 % en un an. Amazon a gagn\u00e9 23 %, Alphabet 28 %, Facebook s'est envol\u00e9 de 56 % et Apple de 85 % ! Ce dernier a engrang\u00e9 plus de 530 milliards de capitalisation boursi\u00e8re en douze mois. Les march\u00e9s ont salu\u00e9 leurs r\u00e9sultats, port\u00e9s par le contexte \u00e9conomique favorable aux Etats-Unis. Difficile, a priori, de faire mieux en 2020, alors que Wall Street pourrait h\u00e9siter face aux incertitudes internationales et se montrer relativement attentiste jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle am\u00e9ricaine.</p><p>Les analystes s'attendent n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 voir Apple franchir all\u00e8grement la barre des 300 dollars \u00e0 la Bourse de New York, port\u00e9 par les ventes de ses accessoires lors des f\u00eates de fin d'ann\u00e9e. Ceux-ci (les AirPods et les Apple Watch notamment) pourraient doper les r\u00e9sultats du quatri\u00e8me trimestre. Les voyants sont aussi au vert pour Facebook. Les analystes d'Aegis Capital ont r\u00e9cemment relev\u00e9 leur objectif de cours de 235 dollars \u00e0 300 dollars (contre un peu plus de 200 actuellement), optimistes sur les progr\u00e8s de la mon\u00e9tisation de WhatsApp et de Messenger, deux services contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par le g\u00e9ant des r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Quant \u00e0 Amazon, UBS a fix\u00e9 un objectif \u00e0 2.100 dollars par action sur douze mois, contre un peu plus de 1.800 actuellement, enthousiasm\u00e9 par les activit\u00e9s de cloud.</p><h>Gafa versus BATX chinois : qui va gagner ?</h><p>En 2020, la bataille va toujours faire rage entre les Gafa et les BATX chinois. Derri\u00e8re cet acronyme se cachent Baidu (moteur de recherche et voiture autonome), Alibaba (e-commerce et paiement mobile), Tencent (r\u00e9seaux sociaux et jeux vid\u00e9o) et Xiaomi, le quatri\u00e8me fabricant mondial de smartphones.</p><p>Les quatre g\u00e9ants chinois sont les seules entreprises au monde \u00e0 avoir l'\u00e9chelle et la puissance de frappe financi\u00e8re pour rivaliser avec les Gafa am\u00e9ricains. Avec 1,1 milliard d'utilisateurs sur sa messagerie WeChat, Tencent talonne Facebook (2,4 milliards de personnes) et sa capitalisation boursi\u00e8re fait des grands pas (458 milliards de dollars contre 585 milliards pour Facebook). Comme les Gafa, les BATX ont aussi enclench\u00e9 un \u00e9norme mouvement de diversification (vers la voiture autonome, les contenus, l'intelligence artificielle...) fond\u00e9 sur la croissance externe. Leur m\u00e9thode privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e de d\u00e9veloppement reste en effet les acquisitions, tandis que, sur ce terrain, les Gafa am\u00e9ricains sont plus prudents.</p><p>De plus en plus pr\u00e9sents en Europe, \u00e0 l'image de Tencent qui vient de racheter 10 % du capital du fran\u00e7ais Universal Music, les BATX le sont toutefois encore peu aux Etats-Unis, en raison de la m\u00e9fiance qu'ils suscitent, particuli\u00e8rement depuis l'arriv\u00e9e de Donald Trump \u00e0 la Maison Blanche. A ce stade, seule TikTok, l'application de vid\u00e9os \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8res du chinois ByteDance, a fait une perc\u00e9e fulgurante. Plus de 26 millions d'Am\u00e9ricains utilisent la plate-forme, dont 60 % ont entre 16 et 24 ans, selon les chiffres officiels. Mieux, en 2018, TikTok a \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9e dans le pays que Facebook, Instagram ou Snapchat.</p><h>Quels progr\u00e8s peut-on attendre sur la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e ?</h><p>C'est la question explosive qui a fait tomber Facebook de son pi\u00e9destal et qui a forc\u00e9 Mark Zuckerberg \u00e0 multiplier les actes de contrition apr\u00e8s le scandale Cambridge Analytica. Comment emp\u00eacher les donn\u00e9es personnelles des internautes d'\u00eatre amass\u00e9es, redistribu\u00e9es et utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers pour des motifs parfois peu avouables ? C'est tout le mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique d'Internet - et de Google et de Facebook en premier lieu - qui est en question.</p><p>Une pseudo-gratuit\u00e9 o\u00f9, pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des services de grande qualit\u00e9 devenus parfois quasi indispensables, il faut accepter d'\u00eatre pist\u00e9 en permanence. Ce que Shoshana Zuboff r\u00e9sume par le titre de son r\u00e9cent ouvrage : \u00ab L'\u00c2ge du capitalisme de surveillance \u00bb. O\u00f9 je suis, qui je contacte, qu'est-ce que j'aime... quantit\u00e9 d'informations peuvent dresser un portrait unique et extr\u00eamement pr\u00e9cis d'un individu. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Les 'J'aime' sur Facebook permettent de d\u00e9duire l'orientation sexuelle avec une pr\u00e9cision de 88 %</emphasis>\u00bb, note l'Institut Montaigne dans une r\u00e9cente \u00e9tude sur l'insuffisante protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles. De quoi faire le bonheur des annonceurs... mais aussi le miel des services d'espionnage, le lit des fake news et le malheur de la d\u00e9mocratie.</p><p>Une prise de conscience s'amorce. Facebook comme Google offrent des outils aux utilisateurs pour g\u00e9rer leurs informations personnelles. Apple fait de la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e un argument marketing phare, m\u00eame s'il ne peut pas contr\u00f4ler toutes les donn\u00e9es personnelles exfiltr\u00e9es par les applications mobiles pour iPhone. L'Europe, suivie par la Californie ou l'Inde, a durci son cadre l\u00e9gal avec le RGPD. Est-ce suffisant ? Certains plaident pour un renforcement drastique de ces garde-fous. Mais certainement pas les Gafa. Les mauvaises pratiques de Facebook en mati\u00e8re de respect de la vie priv\u00e9e lui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 valu 5 milliards de dollars d'amende aux Etats-Unis l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier. Un cadre plus restrictif sur le pistage des internautes co\u00fbterait autrement plus cher \u00e0 la tech am\u00e9ricaine.</p><h>Quelles sont les grandes innovations attendues en 2020 ?</h><p>En 2020, les Gafa vont devoir r\u00e9affirmer leur capacit\u00e9 d'innovation, parfois \u00ab folle \u00bb, dans tous les domaines. Voiture autonome, cerveau connect\u00e9, conqu\u00eate de l'espace, r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle... sont autant de chantiers.</p><p>Entre eux, c'est \u00e0 celui qui surprendra le plus avec une innovation hors norme. Facebook cherche carr\u00e9ment \u00e0 supprimer la commande manuelle des smartphones et des ordinateurs, avec, \u00e0 terme, un bracelet d\u00e9codant l'activit\u00e9 des neurones en signaux num\u00e9riques. La simple intention de poster une photo sur Instagram... suffirait \u00e0 d\u00e9clencher l'action !</p><p>Google lui met les bouch\u00e9es doubles sur la voiture autonome, apr\u00e8s l'acquisition d'une start-up britannique qui apprend aux machines \u00e0 r\u00e9pliquer le comportement des humains. Le g\u00e9ant de Mountain View esp\u00e8re ainsi am\u00e9liorer la r\u00e9action de ses v\u00e9hicules autonomes en cas d'\u00e9v\u00e9nement impr\u00e9vu, par exemple lorsqu'un pi\u00e9ton traverse subitement la rue.</p><p>Amazon, pour sa part, a promis de lancer<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab dans les prochains mois \u00bb</emphasis>son nouveau drone autonome et \u00e9lectrique, Prime Air, qui pourra livrer les colis aux clients situ\u00e9s dans un rayon de 24 kilom\u00e8tres en seulement... une demi-heure.</p><p>Apple travaille sur un casque de r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e, alors que l'entreprise se renforce dans les jeux vid\u00e9os avec Arcade et les contenus avec Apple TV+. L'app\u00e9tit d'Apple pour la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e est devenu encore plus manifeste fin 2019 avec le rachat de la start-up Ikinema, son huiti\u00e8me rachat dans ce secteur au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.</p><p>Il faut aussi s'attendre \u00e0 des prouesses c\u00f4t\u00e9 puissance de calcul. Google a ainsi revendiqu\u00e9 avoir atteint la \u00ab supr\u00e9matie quantique \u00bb en mettant au point un algorithme qu'un ordinateur classique est incapable de faire tourner, provoquant un bras de fer avec IBM, qui conteste l'avanc\u00e9e de son concurrent.</p><p>La maison du futur devrait aussi \u00eatre un enjeu important. Mouvement fort dans ce secteur o\u00f9 les Gafa ont longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 rivaux avec des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes concurrents (Assistant pour Google, Siri chez Apple et Alexa c\u00f4t\u00e9 Amazon) : les trois g\u00e9ants viennent de faire la paix pour \u00e9laborer d'ici \u00e0 la fin 2020 un protocole commun. Objectif : pouvoir piloter les diff\u00e9rents objets connect\u00e9s de la maison depuis n'importe quelle interface, et supprimer ainsi les probl\u00e8mes actuels d'incompatibilit\u00e9, dans ce secteur en pleine explosion. Un vrai changement d'\u00e8re...</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23163330602508516129web\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23163330602508533961webtete\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23163330602508528403web\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23163330602509130142web\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>fichier PDF de ce document</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2020010320\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LESECH-0602508371262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LESECH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWN-XGY1-JCR4-X35S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">233065</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>N\u00b0. 23108</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>vendredi 3 janvier 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

C'est ce que proposent plus de la moiti\u00e9 des s\u00e9nateurs dans une loi qui sera examin\u00e9e par le S\u00e9nat ce mercredi 19 f\u00e9vrier. Elle consacre le principe de \u00ab\u00a0libre choix\u00a0\u00bb de l'utilisateur sur son smartphone ou sur tout terminal. Une autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation serait en charge de v\u00e9rifier si les pratiques portant atteinte \u00e0 ce libre choix - comme l'impossibilit\u00e9 sur un terminal de d\u00e9sinstaller une application ou les pratiques discriminatoires \u00e0 l'encontre d'applications tierces - sont justifi\u00e9es ou non. Il s'agit d'\u00e9tendre la neutralit\u00e9 du Net, aujourd'hui applicable aux tuyaux, aux robinets du Net\u00a0que sont les terminaux. Le texte permet \u00e9galement \u00e0 un r\u00e9gulateur de favoriser l'interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des plateformes. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que l'on peut communiquer d'un op\u00e9rateur t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00e0 un autre, il serait possible pour les utilisateurs qui le souhaitent de communiquer d'un r\u00e9seau social \u00e0 un autre. Cette initiative s\u00e9natoriale propose aussi de renforcer la lutte contre ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler les \u00ab\u00a0acquisitions pr\u00e9datrices\u00a0\u00bb des Big Tech, qui ont pour effet d'ass\u00e9cher la concurrence et de toujours concentrer l'activit\u00e9 du num\u00e9rique sur les plus gros acteurs. Enfin,\u00a0elle confie \u00e0 l'administration le soin de lutter contre les \u00ab\u00a0dark patterns\u00a0\u00bb, ces modes de conceptions des interfaces num\u00e9riques qui orientent techniquement les choix du consommateur et le pi\u00e8gent de fa\u00e7on discutable. Agir vite au niveau national Le S\u00e9nat fran\u00e7ais est la seule chambre parlementaire \u00e0 se lancer dans cette aventure. Alors que des n\u00e9gociations cruciales s'engagent en ce moment m\u00eame au niveau europ\u00e9en, les s\u00e9nateurs proposent d'agir au niveau national pour deux raisons. Le co\u00fbt de l'attente, apr\u00e8s tant d'ann\u00e9es d'atermoiements, est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9. Une r\u00e9gulation europ\u00e9enne, bien que n\u00e9cessaire, ne sera pas applicable avant plusieurs ann\u00e9es\u00a0: la Commission europ\u00e9enne commence les consultations, et de nombreux pays sont r\u00e9ticents... Plus nous attendons, plus nous risquons de laisser les g\u00e9ants asphyxier la concurrence et l'innovation, et enfermer \u00e0 leur insu les consommateurs dans leurs \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes. La France devrait continuer \u00e0 \u00eatre le fer de lance de la r\u00e9gulation du num\u00e9rique en Europe, \u00e0 l'image de ce qu'elle tente de faire sur la taxe sur les services num\u00e9riques et sur la lutte contre la haine en ligne. Le Gouvernement allemand fait le choix de l'action au niveau national, avec la publication d'un projet de loi d'adaptation du droit de la concurrence \u00e0 l'\u00e8re num\u00e9rique. Le S\u00e9nat propose une r\u00e9gulation agile, pro-innovation et qui rend le pouvoir \u00e0 l'utilisateur. La France s'honorerait de prendre le leadership sur cette d\u00e9marche qui en appellera rapidement d'autres. Mercredi, la balle sera dans le camp du Gouvernement\u00a0: lui seul peut inscrire \u00e0 l'ordre du jour de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale cette initiative. Une initiative concomitante de l'Allemagne et de la France en la mati\u00e8re enverrait un signal particuli\u00e8rement positif pour aboutir \u00e0 une solution \u00e0 vingt-sept. Faisons du couple franco-allemand le moteur de ce nouveau mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9gulation du num\u00e9rique\u00a0!

Passer des constats \u00e0 l'action Outre-atlantique, le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement est mis en avant comme l'alpha et l'om\u00e9ga de la r\u00e9gulation du num\u00e9rique. </p><p>Mais l'\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique a ses particularit\u00e9s qui contraignent \u00e0 se passer des vieilles recettes pour imaginer de nouvelles r\u00e9gulations, plus agiles, visant \u00e0 encadrer les plateformes dites \u00ab\u00a0structurantes\u00a0\u00bb. C'est ce que proposent plus de la moiti\u00e9 des s\u00e9nateurs dans une loi qui sera examin\u00e9e par le S\u00e9nat ce mercredi 19 f\u00e9vrier. Elle consacre le principe de \u00ab\u00a0libre choix\u00a0\u00bb de l'utilisateur sur son smartphone ou sur tout terminal. Une autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation serait en charge de v\u00e9rifier si les pratiques portant atteinte \u00e0 ce libre choix - comme l'impossibilit\u00e9 sur un terminal de d\u00e9sinstaller une application ou les pratiques discriminatoires \u00e0 l'encontre d'applications tierces - sont justifi\u00e9es ou non. Il s'agit d'\u00e9tendre la neutralit\u00e9 du Net, aujourd'hui applicable aux tuyaux, aux robinets du Net\u00a0que sont les terminaux. Le texte permet \u00e9galement \u00e0 un r\u00e9gulateur de favoriser l'interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des plateformes. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que l'on peut communiquer d'un op\u00e9rateur t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00e0 un autre, il serait possible pour les utilisateurs qui le souhaitent de communiquer d'un r\u00e9seau social \u00e0 un autre. Cette initiative s\u00e9natoriale propose aussi de renforcer la lutte contre ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler les \u00ab\u00a0acquisitions pr\u00e9datrices\u00a0\u00bb des Big Tech, qui ont pour effet d'ass\u00e9cher la concurrence et de toujours concentrer l'activit\u00e9 du num\u00e9rique sur les plus gros acteurs. Enfin,\u00a0elle confie \u00e0 l'administration le soin de lutter contre les \u00ab\u00a0dark patterns\u00a0\u00bb, ces modes de conceptions des interfaces num\u00e9riques qui orientent techniquement les choix du consommateur et le pi\u00e8gent de fa\u00e7on discutable. Agir vite au niveau national Le S\u00e9nat fran\u00e7ais est la seule chambre parlementaire \u00e0 se lancer dans cette aventure. Alors que des n\u00e9gociations cruciales s'engagent en ce moment m\u00eame au niveau europ\u00e9en, les s\u00e9nateurs proposent d'agir au niveau national pour deux raisons. Le co\u00fbt de l'attente, apr\u00e8s tant d'ann\u00e9es d'atermoiements, est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9. Une r\u00e9gulation europ\u00e9enne, bien que n\u00e9cessaire, ne sera pas applicable avant plusieurs ann\u00e9es\u00a0: la Commission europ\u00e9enne commence les consultations, et de nombreux pays sont r\u00e9ticents... Plus nous attendons, plus nous risquons de laisser les g\u00e9ants asphyxier la concurrence et l'innovation, et enfermer \u00e0 leur insu les consommateurs dans leurs \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes. La France devrait continuer \u00e0 \u00eatre le fer de lance de la r\u00e9gulation du num\u00e9rique en Europe, \u00e0 l'image de ce qu'elle tente de faire sur la taxe sur les services num\u00e9riques et sur la lutte contre la haine en ligne. Le Gouvernement allemand fait le choix de l'action au niveau national, avec la publication d'un projet de loi d'adaptation du droit de la concurrence \u00e0 l'\u00e8re num\u00e9rique. Le S\u00e9nat propose une r\u00e9gulation agile, pro-innovation et qui rend le pouvoir \u00e0 l'utilisateur. La France s'honorerait de prendre le leadership sur cette d\u00e9marche qui en appellera rapidement d'autres. Mercredi, la balle sera dans le camp du Gouvernement\u00a0: lui seul peut inscrire \u00e0 l'ordre du jour de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale cette initiative. Une initiative concomitante de l'Allemagne et de la France en la mati\u00e8re enverrait un signal particuli\u00e8rement positif pour aboutir \u00e0 une solution \u00e0 vingt-sept. Faisons du couple franco-allemand le moteur de ce nouveau mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9gulation du num\u00e9rique\u00a0!</p><p>D'apr\u00e8s Sophie Primas, \u00ab le S\u00e9nat propose une r\u00e9gulation agile, pro-innovation et qui rend le pouvoir \u00e0 l utilisateur \u00bb.

Bush - suggests there is a problem with the way the current agency interprets the \"convenience\" element. The FCC, he says, is layering on new regulations when it is convenient for edge providers like Google. Powell says restraint is a regulatory tool, and one current FCC chairman Tom Wheeler appears not to be including in the tool kit at his disposal to ensure fair play in the broadband marketplace.</p><p>The issue that really gets under his skin is the FCC's set-top proposal, or what Powell labels a \"nonsensical,\" backward-looking vision of video. Wheeler is creating a market for cable boxes at a time when many consumers would like to see set-tops eliminated completely, Powell contends.</p><p>The bigger concern surrounds network neutrality and a cable operator's right to run a broadband business - complex issues that, in Powell's view, have been hijacked by giant Internet rivals with simplistic slogans. He is looking to derail the notion that edge providers are the Internet's engine and that ISPs simply provide the railroad tracks.</p><p>As the cable industry prepared to head to Boston for this week's INTX: The Internet &amp; Television Expo, Powell sat down with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Multichannel News</emphasis> Washington bureau chief John Eggerton to talk about those issues and others. An edited excerpt follows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: What is wrong with the way the FCC has addressed cable broadband privacy?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Powell:</emphasis> You break the house [by reclassifying broadband Internet access as an information service under Title II of the Communications Act], and then you say you need to fix it.</p><p>Part of what is troubling is if they move forward on this - because they feel they have to, having disenfranchised the Federal Trade Commission of its authority over privacy - authority under which these companies for decades have operated without any evidentiary record of privacy violations or proof of demonstrated harms.</p><p>So, why there is a need for an old-style telecom approach to CPNI [Customer Proprietary Network Information] in this context is certainly not clear from any kind of record and practice. But that is not really the issue. ... What continues to frustrate me is a government that continues to make its regulatory judgments quite conveniently depending on who they apply to.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: For example?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> It is a little much for me to see, in the set-top box proposal, the commission seeming to be perfectly comfortable with general state law regulation and Federal Trade Commission regulation of third-party set-top manufacturers - and, let's be honest, that means big tech companies like Google and TiVo being able to deliver a multichannel video experience - and [those companies] not [having] to comply with the privacy requirements that all other video providers have to comply with. No matter what you believe philosophically or ideologically about these issues, we should all believe in coherence and consistency.</p><p>I can't understand why - if this is so critical to the consumer, and [it's] so essential that the consumer be protected, and, as the chairman says, the consumer owns the data - why is that logic not equally compelling when they use the products and services of companies who, by the way, have a dramatically higher demonstrated pattern of collecting, using and monetizing private data?</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>NCTA president and CEO Michael Powell in his Washington, D.C., office.</p><p>In fact, one would argue that's the very central core of the enormous profitability of those enterprises, and yet that's seen, dismissively, as untroubling where there is evidence of problems - and in an area that involves us, where there's no evidence of problems, somehow we need this heavy-handed regime.</p><p>My only request of the government is that you have a holistic, sensible view about these issues that apply commonly. In fact, [the Obama administration] numerous times has said the same thing. When the White House put out its privacy report, they expressly stated that the goal should be to create a harmonious privacy regime so that the consumer is not confused.</p><p>How do you expect your neighbor to sit down at a computer and decide to go look at things on Facebook and understand the difference between the ISP who might collect data subject to your opt-in requirements [in the CPNI proposal], but the activity that you are engaged in on Facebook is not?</p><p>To the consumer, I think that's a seamless, unbifurcated experience and if [consumers] are upset about their privacy, then they are upset about whoever is collecting [their data].</p><p>The last point I would make is that one of the biggest arguments made by the commission, as well as other government officials and academics now, is the amount of data collection that goes on in society today.</p><p>But for consumers, it is OK, or mostly OK, is because it's a tradeoff, right? Consumers get enormous benefit by having their experience tailored to their desires and wishes because of data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Do you think the chairman can't similarly regulate the edge or he just won't?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Let me put it this way: To some degree he can't, to some degree he won't. He doesn't seem to show any inclination. It's been a commission that has been awfully aggressive and creative with its jurisdiction when it wants to be.</p><p>It is a commission that argued that it has sweeping authority under Section 706, under some virtuous circle theory of what makes broadband hum, that arguably is broad enough to include edge providers.</p><p>So, it seems to me that given this commission's pattern of being pretty aggressive with ambiguity about its jurisdiction when it chooses to ... but remember, regulatory wisdom is not only what you do, but what you elect not to do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Is that why you recommended using the Federal Trade Commission's regulatory model?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> The reason ISPs provided proposals to adopt an FTC-like regime was not to avoid the need to regulate privacy, it was to urge the commission to regulate privacy in the manner being done elsewhere so you don't distort the competitive marketplace. That is completely in the commission's power. Restraint is a regulatory tool.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: What is wrong, if anything, with the FCC's approach to Lifeline reform?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> We have been very supportive of repurposing. The market has done a phenomenal job of reaching more corners of the country than has even been achieved by telecom services or indoor plumbing or electricity, and in a shorter period of time.</p><p>I can see the merits of a cap, if well-constructed. But even if it isn't used, I think the commission has an obligation to ensure that these issues are addressed. And I worked with a lot of these issues when I was a commissioner and we would find fraud and misuse.</p><p>Whenever you take a huge pot of money guaranteed by the federal government and put it out in the marketplace and encourage people to come and get it, you're going to get the knave as well as the noble.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: You are saying it is a given?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> It will be an attractive honey pot. Whether you can prevent the badgers from getting the honey is really the question mark.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Rate regulation of special access - that is, business broadband services - is another issue that concerns you. How has the FCC gotten that wrong?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Special access is a stunning, almost incomprehensible initial proposal because this commission is quite articulate about saying that \"competition, competition, competition\" should be the touchstone of everything. And, fair enough. But the real issue is what does \"competition\" mean?</p><p>The cable industry is without question a competitive disruptor in this space.</p><p>This is how competition works: If a monopolist prices something too high, what the theory says is that so long as there are no artificial barriers to entry, competitors should enter that market to provide the same services more efficiently at a lower price than the incumbent.</p><p>Those dynamics are what led cable companies to enter the provision of Internet business services in those markets. They are an entrant; they are a competitor. The historical problem with access, whatever the breadth of it may be, is a consequence of the historical Bell system and the incumbent power of the telephone companies in those markets.</p><p>Without prejudging whether they are still a problem, it is amazing to be told after you have already competed - entered these markets, and began to build a business - that you now, by virtue of entering those markets having never been subject to rate regulation as a competitive entrant, now, at least theoretically, are subject to the commission's power to regulate the terms, costs, prices and services of your products, even though you are not the incumbent in the market. You are doing the very thing that the government would hope and wish to see.</p><p>Think about it this way: Why should any competitor ever be second to market? If you are second to market and you are going to have your rates regulated, why not hold back and see if you are third to market so that the market is competitive and you won't have your rates regulated?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: How big a problem would that rate regulation be?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Our companies are very worried about it. And it seems to happen after you make major investment decisions based on the rules as they've been forever understood.</p><p>You are messing with people's investment-backed expectations. Companies went and built businesses and deployed infrastructure to enter these markets to be a competitor and suddenly wake up to be told, \"Thanks for your service, but you will now be subject to the same regulatory risk of the incumbent who has been there for 70 years with perhaps 80% market share.\" That is stunning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: But doesn't it fit with the chairman's general theory that gatekeepers need regulation, because we don't know what these monopolists are going to do next to disrupt the virtuous circle or the seemingly untouchable edge?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Here's the thing that is important. The commission has always understood that network industries are hard. They're expensive. They require a lot of capital. They don't support hundreds of competitors. They support a handful if you get it right.</p><p>We learned that when prior commissions tried to overfacilitate the entry of CLECs [competitive local-exchange carriers] in the 2000s, and we produced thousands and thousands of these little companies, the vast majority of whom went radically bankrupt in the course of about two years.</p><p>Overprovisioning of network industries is dangerous.</p><p>But the commission has always looked to incumbents to cross-enter each other's markets as a way of bringing competition to a market in a manner that recognizes the scale and costs and challenges associated with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Let's talk network neutrality and the Open Internet order. [At press time, a lawsuit challenging the order was still pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.]</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> I think the damage is that you retard the pace, the vigor, the experimentation of network growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Has that already happened?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> I think it is almost irrelevant to have a dueling battle over whether stock prices are down or capex is different because it will reveal itself over time. Do we see signs? Yes.</p><p>I didn't write the reports that say capex and investment are down, but I think credible people have suggested that is what has been observed. Particularly for telephone companies who are trying to make a pretty massive migration from copper to fiber, it's really complicating - Verizon drifting into AOL and Yahoo and go90, and less emphasis on its role as an infrastructure provider.</p><p>And mind you, this was the company that tore after net neutrality in the first place and seems to be taking an \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" mentality about the future direction of the company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: So, might things such as new special access regulations be a spur to consolidation?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Special access, net-neutrality regulation, All Vid [set-top] regulation, privacy regulation: If that is the environment in which every communications company has to operate, don't be surprised if they are all looking to size and scale as a response to the regulators' decision. You used to be able to take a lot of risk and invest a lot of capital with the hope of great return on that risk. Regulation dampens the return on that risk, so you take fewer risks and you try to de-risk your business model.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p121\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Re/code's Kara Swisher interviews Powell at the 2015 INTX in Chicago.</p><p>One of the best ways people de-risk businesses is by making them bigger, with bigger scale. So, when people complain about consolidation and mergers, they don't tend to see the connection to unfriendly regulatory policies that tend to drive people in that direction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: The Charter-Time Warner Cable deal has a seven-year prohibition on data caps, something the FCC is still looking at in terms of the industry more generally. Republican FCC member Michael O'Rielly has suggested it was regulating by condition. What is your view of how the deal was conditioned?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Whatever they are, they are the terms and conditions that the companies agreed to as part of the exchange of value in an effort to get the merger approved. I have a longstanding criticism about the way these mergers are done, whether they are truly efforts to prevent competitive harm or they are efforts to regulate substantially more than their jurisdictional authority allows through the use of a vehicle where companies have no choice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: You have had a lot to say about set-tops. Anything more you would like to add?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Yes, because I think we now have had a filing date come and go. And if there is one thing I would say, it's that when you dig into the comments, many of the concerns that we have been raising red flags about for four months are pretty heavily validated by the enormous coalition of interests that have filed in opposition to this proposal - an overwhelming number when compared to those who filed in favor of it, by the way, by a huge order of magnitude. Not to mention the 73,000 petitioners who said they shouldn't do this.</p><p>The facile narrative that I hear thrown out that cable opposes this because they are getting rich on set-top boxes is also completely undermined because 90% of those filing have no financial interest in the income stream from set-top boxes.</p><p>If you are the Communications Workers of America, you don't get any money from the set-top box business. If you are the Creative Coalition, or the Recording Industry Association of America or Roku, by the way, or the minority communities and civilrights communities, you are not opposing this because you have a bunch of money coming from chaining consumers to their box.</p><p>While I get the sort of late-night TV appeal of that tagline [\"unlock the box\"], it is a willful smoke screen to understanding the deep and complex issues that are just under the surface, like copyright and violation of your rights as a creator and distributor; privacy protections that get eliminated and eviscerated.</p><p>Google filed with the FCC saying they won't live by the privacy rules, don't want to live by the privacy rules. They say the privacy rules are unnecessary. Why is it necessary for all video subscribers to be protected the way Congress has [protected them], but when they start watching video on a different input, those privacy protections are no longer relevant?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Well, the chairman has said he would listen and, if there are suggestions to better protect copyright and other rights, he is open ...</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> We have heard that in almost every proceeding, and it usually comes out awfully close to the way he says it is going to come out. But I will take him at his word. If he sincerely is going to work on an order that doesn't just take these things into account, but actually addresses and removes them as a concern, I think everybody will be happy. We think we know exactly how to do that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: How?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> We're not against third-party boxes. We think there is a better approach consistent with the way everybody wants to do it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Which is?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Apps. I would encourage you to read [Netflix CEO] Reed Hastings's quote on his earnings call, when he was asked about this and he said, more or less, that we believe that Roku is an open platform. We believe that Apple TV is an open platform. We believe delivering television experiences by app is the future of television. If the FCC proposal is approved, it will be meaningless to us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Why did he say that?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Because the world has already settled on how it likes to consume Internet-centric content. Roku builds an interface. It's their interface by the way - it's their media-rich features; it's their color selection; it's their platform of how they arrange the apps; it's their advertising space. And what they do is provide a curated collection of apps that let the consumer choose which source of video content they want to watch. You can pick Netflix. You can pick Hulu. You can pick HBO Now or Crackle or ESPN.</p><p>There is no reason why the other app there couldn't be Comcast Xfinity, and you could click that app and watch the full Comcast experience that you bought and paid for. And that wouldn't violate any of the copyright concerns. It would ameliorate all minority programming concerns. It would fix all the privacy concerns.</p><p>There is no argument I have even remotely heard that says why that isn't a complete and fully satisfactory solution.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p131\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Powell sat on a recent Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute panel in Washington.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: But clearly the chairman doesn't see it that way.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> The commission seems to be hung up on the old-world version of the linear guide. But the future is not going to be in linear guides because Netflix is going to control its environment.</p><p>If consumers want to watch Netflix next to Comcast content, you are not going to have a guide to integrate those two things, because Netflix is not going to let you unbundle their app and take their content out and put it in that guide. They will let you have Netflix, but you have to open the door and come inside Netflix's house to watch their programming. And as long as the commission doesn't have any authority over them, and it is quick to tell everyone it doesn't, the vast majority of content is going to be sitting on a Roku or an Apple TV or a Google box, it is going to be content that can only be accessed by app, so there is no reason why the cable content shouldn't be accessible the same way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: What is the difference between that and chairman Wheeler's suggestion that his is also an app-based solution?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Let's just be blunt. The chairman does not want the cable industry to deliver the totality of its service into an app that can then be run, basically, on any third-party device in the world.</p><p>I would argue first of all that is all Section 629 [the congressional directive about availability of competitive navigation devices] calls for. And then you ask, why is it not OK for the cable industry to develop an app that provides a complete solution?</p><p>By the way, when you say \"solution,\" it gives the customer every single thing they paid for when they signed up. The commission is insisting that we strip out major aspects of our service. Strip out our guide, strip out our apps, strip out aspects of our interactivity and two-way services, and turn over in the raw the content stream and certain data that says whether or not you are a Comcast subscriber. And then their theory is [to] let the third party replace all of those things we've stripped out. If you think about it, that is a nonsensical vision that sees TV the way it was 30 years ago and the way it is not going today. ...</p><p>Some people like the Apple TV environment way more than the Roku TV environment. Some people like Amazon Fire more than the Apple environment. That is where you get interface competition. By the way, that's competition we would support.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Like Comcast's app?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> When Comcast announces it will do an app that will run on Roku, Comcast loses all control of the core interface. When you turn on Roku, it's Roku stuff. To get to Comcast stuff, you have to pick Comcast.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: And that's fine.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> We're saying, \"Hallelujah, that's the solution.\" And, by the way, that solution exists today. The top three cable companies already have an app - Comcast, Charter, Time Warner Cable - with more coming.</p><p>We don't need a standards body and a three-year process to write a new standard and develop a new second box in order to make the FCC box work. We don't need to do any of that. [But] they seem locked into doing all that, which will come to fruition, if it ever does, five years from now and I am 100% sure that by the time we get there, no one will even care.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Putting on your FCC chairman emeritus hat, should the President have weighed in on the set-top proposal?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> No.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Why not?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> Don't get me wrong. Is the president entitled to express an opinion to the commission? Yes, he is. The question is, is that all that's happening?</p><p>The White House, in a blog, took a position on a proceeding that the record wasn't even closed on. As far as I know, they never took any meetings from any of us on it to hear the other side of the story before reaching that conclusion. Quite interesting that they wouldn't, given the enormous array of companies and interests and consumer groups who have expressed profound concerns about the proposal.</p><p>Nonetheless, I'm unaware of any meaningful process or opportunity to let the White House hear opposing views on this. Second, calling on the commission to take a specific action with that much specificity really takes advantage of the enormous coercive power of the presidency to put commissioners, particularly those in the president's party, in a highly uncomfortable and difficult position that they shouldn't be put in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: How so?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MP:</emphasis> The agency legally, technically and spiritually is supposed to be an independent agency, and even the appearance of that kind of administrative interference is damaging to its credibility and the sense of fairness that we are all supposed to be entitled to when we prosecute our issues in front of that body. I think that has been undermined by the White House's actions.</p><p>And for what reason? They seem to frequently take credit in their own political material for actions they don't control. When they tweet out that, \"we are fixing set-top boxes for you,\" who is \"we?\" That is not a matter in the White House's jurisdiction, yet efforts are made to take political credit for the actions of an independent agency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JSG-8X91-DY5H-12HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XXXVII</volume><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 16, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is Wednesday, November 28th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump versus Fed Chairman Jay Powell.  The President lashing out  at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p>It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this  afternoon, 12:00 noon.  </p><p>Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on.  The focus on President Trump's working  dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.  </p><p>The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air. </p><p>And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  There's disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than the United States.  </p><p>We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and  others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump confirming that possibility.  We are looking at  the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at  futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent.   S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.  </p><p>We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning.   We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for  the third quarter.  </p><p>Markets are up ahead of that.  </p><p>Gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p>The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points.  The NASDAQ was up eight  points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point,  and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third  of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the action is mixed.  FT-100 pulling back a  fraction, but the CAC Quarante is up 21 points, and the DAX Index in  Germany up 28 points.  It's good enough for a quarter of a percent gain in  Germany.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board, take a look at the best  performers there, Japan, Hong Kong, China, all up better than one percent  overnight.  </p><p>Cindy Hyde-Smith holds on, the republican beating democrat Mike Espy to  keep her Mississippi Senate seat, bringing the latest in that late results.  </p><p>Plus LeBron James looking beyond basketball.  Details on his new venture  with Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lindsey Vonn in wellness,  offering energy powders and supplements.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and former Arkansas Governor,  Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee.  </p><p>Great to see you this morning. </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be with you, Maria.  Thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Good morning. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Good morning.  Hopefully, we get  the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's  anticipating that. </p><p>That's a great quarter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be a good quarter. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  We need it.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the President going after  General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax  credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down  for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've  hit this threshold.  </p><p>So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't  have to do anything.  They just have to step back and not extend it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the subsidies go away on their own. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer.  Tesla  already hit it recently.  </p><p>General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so  gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say,  \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these  billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government  Motors.  I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm  done with them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.  </p><p>And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're  not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel  and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump  administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing  them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what  Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S.  has been for a long, long time. </p><p>KELLY:  That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to  corporations?  I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Nope.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers?  So.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  We shouldn't be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- and there was the bailout. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why this is such a particularly important story  because a few years ago -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is the company that was bailed out.  Got a lot on the  table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General  Motors. </p><p>KELLY:  Crony Capitalism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point that out.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yup.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big number, yes, you're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Exactly right, Kevin.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and  member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.  </p><p>Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former  Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.  </p><p>Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.  </p><p>Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  </p><p>Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us.  Dr. Mike is going to joining us  as well.  Lots to talk about there.  </p><p>But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again.  The  President continues his campaign against Powell.  President Trump  criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.  </p><p>In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and  layoffs at General Motors.  </p><p>The President says this.  \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my  selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm  just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're  doing.\"</p><p>This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will  be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth  Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee. </p><p>Michael, good to see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH:  Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.  </p><p>LEE:  So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success  in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher. </p><p>And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for  forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to  your economy over time. </p><p>When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no  inflation.  We need higher interest rates in this country. </p><p>I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long  overdue.  </p><p>And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the  macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks. </p><p>The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and  Bank of America which loans they can and can't make. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>LEE:  Right?  It just -- it shouldn't work like that. </p><p>And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching  overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.  </p><p>So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the  regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.  </p><p>So, I think the President made right choice.  I think he's unhappy with the  reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe.  But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the  Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as  the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the  impact of these rate hikes.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>KELLY:  Well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you really need four rate hikes this is year? </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close  to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say  we need to get back to neutral. </p><p>And guess what?  Guess who would agree with me?  Candidate President --  Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said  interest rates were too low.  </p><p>And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're  barely at breakeven rates.  </p><p>If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is,  it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?  </p><p>You can even have negative real interest rates.  </p><p>So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington  Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the  fed because his exact quote was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut.  My gut tells me  more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p>He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\"   Well, guess what?  President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated  by the fed.  </p><p>Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy,  and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't do any fiscal policies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are  going higher?  </p><p>We were at negative.  We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We  got to get back to normal.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in  a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used  to that. </p><p>Let's talk about policy over personality.  That's -- we're all used to  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  Good.  Good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you  know what, that's who the American people elected, number one. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Good.  I like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise.  People  automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead. </p><p>He's not being hot-headed about this.  He's a real estate developer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the  -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this  country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for  six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for  eight straight months.  </p><p>Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the  economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral?  Are we  in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a  world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in  the last 30 or 40 years?  </p><p>Eight percent mortgage?  I don't think that this economy can handle that,  so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And I don't think that's normal.  Is that normal? </p><p>KELLY:  That's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that the -- </p><p>KELLY:  That's (INAUDIBLE) housing.  Housing isn't affordable in a lot of  these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't  have speculation in the housing market. </p><p>And that's what they're preventing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's a reason why mortgage  rates are going to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not their job.  Their job isn't to prevent speculation. </p><p>KELLY:  Their -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Their job isn't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Their job is to prevent runaway inflation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Runaway inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what -- </p><p>KELLY:  And what happens when housing inflations go up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the runaway inflation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But there's no -- there isn't.  </p><p>KELLY:  There's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's no inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what my point is, is that -- </p><p>KELLY:  Inflation is picking up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not. </p><p>KELLY:  That's why they're raising rates.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not.  And it's actually very, very tame.  </p><p>KELLY:  What housing market are you looking at? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p>LEE:  I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the  interest rate. </p><p>As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was  cost rates were much higher than they are right now.  </p><p>Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're  not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is  available, rates can be much, much higher.  </p><p>So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage  and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.  </p><p>So, as rates move higher, okay?  And credit availability increases, which  it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I  believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone  pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again.  That's  changing. </p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened  since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's  changing.</p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened  since the election has changed that, okay?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine  moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.  </p><p>We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is  going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page  story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed  is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.  </p><p>It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to  perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of  inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the  markets.  </p><p>That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article.  But -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP  today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and  a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.  </p><p>Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike,  but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at  noon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know you're going to be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to be there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read  on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision  in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy  in general.  </p><p>Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up  this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.  </p><p>The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi  Jinping.  </p><p>National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible  breakthrough in the trade talks. </p><p>He said this yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a  deal and he is open to it.  </p><p>But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago  are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's  perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here  actually? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with  China.  </p><p>But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.  </p><p>I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but  to everybody.  </p><p>And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're  used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach  has gotten our heads handed to us.  </p><p>And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations,  does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.  </p><p>And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between  America First and America Only.  They think that he's, you know, some  nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not  true.  </p><p>But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the  American President and thank God for it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that  China has been abusing -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- has been the bad actor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has been stealing IP.  </p><p>Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with  China at this point? </p><p>LEE:  Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic  breakthrough at this dinner.  I would -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LEE:  I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these  tariffs down the road.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I think you're right because -- </p><p>LEE:  -- and continue talking, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>LEE:  Yes.  You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally,  but that's short-term.  </p><p>This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going  away.  </p><p>The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to  open up markets and for peace and prosperity. </p><p>BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.  </p><p>You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and  they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.   There's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning they want to be number one in all the important  industries. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, including military.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.

Big tech continues to move into health care, it  is raising fresh privacy concerns, though.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details on that.  Lauren, good morning. </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this,  you might appreciate what they're doing.  Let me explain.  </p><p>So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your  health data, your medical records.  </p><p>Why are they doing this?  Well, they want to make money, health care is a  $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save  money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first  time. </p><p>And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their  press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you  have software, and algorithms.  </p><p>And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical  text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the  limiting resource is time.  So, that's where they can come in and help.  </p><p>It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right  patients and the right drug trials.  </p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care.  Here's Toby  Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are now an Advisor to Google.  </p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is  spending the resources on healthcare expertise. </p><p>COSGROVE:  You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the  high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether  watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or  Amazon and Google as well. </p><p>Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a  problem and, B, an opportunity.  </p><p>The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is  doubling every 73 days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an incredibly stat.  </p><p>COSGROVE:  Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage  all this data. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data  being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine  learning. </p><p>COSGROVE:  Exactly.  Well, on top of that, it also gives you  interoperability. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going  through you data in the first place with not getting hacked? </p><p>So this is the way we're moving, you know.  You go to the doctor now, the  doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an  iPad.  You see it all the time.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We're there. </p><p>Do we trust algorithms? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us,  Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has  a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this  vehicle, they can perform many of the things.  </p><p>And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person,  the more important.  </p><p>So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it  takes in the vehicle.  It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit. </p><p>So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really  life-saving.  </p><p>It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I  recognize that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person  that she went to see for it missed it.  She was stroking for about five  days. </p><p>So, again, whatever it takes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for these doctors.  </p><p>And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even  just the management of the drugs that you're taking.  With my mom having  stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the  drugs that she has to take.  </p><p>Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital,  there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four  years ago.  </p><p>Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for  particularly catastrophic illness.  </p><p>And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech  companies with the data?  Why do we trust the government, governor?  </p><p>Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of  health information, why do we trust the government over big companies? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who says we trust them?  I don't trust any of them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why I said that. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach  company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer  living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes  over to our homes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and  listens to us.  Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off  because they are -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So -- exactly.  So while there are risks in terms of privacy  and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the  positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care  outweigh it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I  would trust Amazon and a big tech company.  </p><p>Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands  of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting  digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple  would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then  say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong  address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been  performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon  basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  I -- that's amazing that  data is doubling every 73 days in health care.  Lauren, thanks.  Lauren  Simonetti.  </p><p>Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the  company's plan to restart search engine operations in China.  More of the  fallout there.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November  28th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The President versus the Federal Reserve, President Trump slamming Jay  Powell, again, ahead of the Fed chairman's speech today, telling the  Washington Post yesterday, that h is not, at all, happy with Powell.</p><p>Fox Business will bring you that speech live, at noontime today, stay with  us, and you'll hear what Jay Powell has to say about where we are on the  economy, right now.  We are two hours away from the second reading on the  third quarter GDP.  Analysts are expecting growth in the GDP of 3-1/2  percent.</p><p>We will have those numbers, in two hours' time, for you, and show you how  it is impacting markets.  Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the  start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65  points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent  higher, right now.</p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials  picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the  S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very  much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up  eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points,  fractional moves here.</p><p>Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent  in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p>Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go  ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that  this morning.  Plus -- this, ahead of President Trump's upcoming meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, later  this week.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather, Sidney, Australia, hit by its average monthly  rainfall over the course of two hours.</p><p>And a new venture, LeBron James teams up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Cindy Crawford, for wellness.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Wednesday morning, but first, this top  story, this half an hour, partisan divide over more tax cuts, House  Republicans now having a new tax package, facing opposition from Democrats,  who say they were blindsided by this proposal.</p><p>The House GOP unveiling their new round of tax cuts, this week, hoping to  pass it during Congress' Lame-Duck Session.  The package would revive  expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change  savings and retirement-related provisions.  Here's contributor from The  Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk  more on taxes.</p><p>Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this.  We've  been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months.  What's  your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done,  in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p>TATE:  Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety  of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and  the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you  mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of  disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's  tax law.</p><p>It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that  the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats  objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts,  permanent.</p><p>Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats  would have to agree to it and come on board.  But I've got to tell you,  Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this.   The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p>And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial  stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was  put together without their input.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time  around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan.  And as you say,  Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking  about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not controversial at all.  But again, I don't -- the  Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you  make better decisions with your money, number one.  Number two, they are  not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, they're not.  But this is something the Republicans could  have and should have done.  They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to  come through.  They've got the votes between now and January.  And as Larry  the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know  this tax bill will get crushed, right?  Is it going to be middle of  December, is our last hope?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out  because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p>TATE:  Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has  a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic.  A  lot of this is about political optics, too.  I mean, the Democrats do not  want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law.   They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing  progress.</p><p>And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating  over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear  what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this  package that the President has been talking about because in addition to  making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants  to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do  you know, Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be.  It's  one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but  unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is  never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget  that they were elected by one 435th of the American population.  The  President was elected by the entire country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why is he still there?  He said he's stepping down, and  yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas  that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a  year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p>So, we ask, why now?  Why the subpoenas coming out now?  I don't mean to  change the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  And I think that was so inept, I have to  say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta  Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner?   And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's all about the money.  It's who the donors are and how  they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has  been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with  obligations to all the donors.</p><p>He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental  difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more  effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  President Obama attending the  Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president  took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only did I not  get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way,  was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about.   In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to  get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p>TATE:  Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney  general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn  over documents requested by Congress.  His other attorney general, Loretta  Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill  Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton  were dropped.</p><p>But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time  right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming  from a former president.  I mean, right now, we are at the point where  leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs,  you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and  Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p>We need rhetoric that brings people together.  And by the way, I've been  equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well.  But, you  know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TATE:  He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against  his political enemies from the IRS -- </p><p>TATE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that  we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go  low, well, we're right there with you.  President Trump speaking and  communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us  see who all these people are.</p><p>And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make  jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense.  Again, they're all --  they're all the same, all of them.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in  particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because  they were protected.  Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an  illegal server.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I  think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted,  anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class  throughout their administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for  Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, think about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is such a good point.</p><p>KELLY:  Strzok and Page too.  I mean, that sets an example.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You call it a matter, not an investigation.  And that's  exactly what he did, he called it a matter.  Kristin, it's great to get  your insights always, come back soon.</p><p>TATE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there.  Coming up,  Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the  torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater.  Then, Krispy  Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which  features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time.   Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial  China search projects.  Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  We have been talking about this for a while, Maria.  Some workers  at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in  China.  At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers  published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative;  it's known as Project Dragonfly.  They say it's a \"censored search engine  for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\"  The browser will  allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten  dozens of signatures in addition.  Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are  up less than one percent for the year.</p><p>Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia.  More than  500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average  monthly rainfall within just two hours.  About a dozen people had to be  rescued from their cars; they were trapped.  And thousands of homes lost  power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.  </p><p>Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size  Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story.  This is crazy.  He spent  almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to  sail now from Holland to Israel.  He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it  only makes sense to take it to God's land.  One problem: there's no motor  in the ark.  And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can  rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically.  So,  we'll see if he raises the money.  </p><p>And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this  year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes!   Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin  candy.  And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return.  Looks  like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside.  A  holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut.   All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts.  I apologize  now, Maria.  I failed you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that  story, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Very sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters.  Remember our ugly  Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  </p><p>CASONE:  So much fun.  I saved mine, by the way.  I'm ready to go for this  year.  It is coming back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There we are.  Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are  coming to you with our ugly sweaters there.  Dagen, that was fun.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered  yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them  delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  I appreciate that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I did.  It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE).  And I still have it.   I've worn it multiple times --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, I like your reindeer sweater.  Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think mine had a nose on the --  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Says who?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't need one for Christmas, there you go.  So, don't get me  one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron,  how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a  path toward healthy living.  We'll tell you about the products next up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and  charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the  details, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria,  considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and  all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were  shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington  Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers.  While Foster is  not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team  facility.  Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent  allegations against him.  A lot of his former teammates who is are now with  the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the  decision to bring him on board.  </p><p>Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service,  joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of  live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.  </p><p>Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose  reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball.  Rob Manfred  yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling  operation.  Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM  Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly  suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out,  the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.  </p><p>What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy  Crawford, Lindsey Vonn?  A health and wellness company that they have  formed called Ladder. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL:  They say, you should do this alone.  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  That if you want  something done right, you have to do it yourself.  </p><p>LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER:  They say you should never ask for  help.  </p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER:  We say, there's strength in  numbers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these  four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines.  There's  going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're  going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build  the ladder to wellness.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it wellness or protein powders?  I mean --</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is protein powder wellness?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say.  So,  there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way.   Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day,  get off of your butt and get running.  That's the ticket to health and  wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner.   Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did  was terrible but let's do some gambling.  </p><p>MAX:  And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of  fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this  morning, they have to get real on this.  </p><p>KELLY:  Pete Rose meet the deadline, though.  Didn't he have only so many  years he could be elected in?  </p><p>MAX:  You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader.  (INAUDIBLE),  did he bet against his own team?  Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough  already.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, you --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, I just want to say amen.  Amen and amen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  Amen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's why I like Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah.</p><p>MAX:  I like this guy too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good sports stories today, Jared.

Good Wednesday  morning, everybody.  Good morning to you.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, November 28th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump is doubling down on the border  and the funding.  In a new interview with Politico, he says he's willing to  shut down the government over getting that money to build the wall.   Reaction this morning from Capitol Hill coming up.</p><p>President Trump is also fighting the Fed.  The President lashing out at Fed  chairman Jay Powell again yesterday.  This comes ahead of a highly- anticipated speech from Powell this afternoon. </p><p>Fox Business will take you there live.  We have full coverage of the  chairman's comments today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern.  He is speaking at the  Economic Club of New York.  Stay with us for that speech.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are on G-20 countdown, the focus is on President Trump's  working dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday in Argentina  at the G-20 meeting.  The question on whether they make a deal on trade is  still up in the air.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  The President said there  is a good possibility that we can make a deal and he is open to it.  But on  the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago are not  met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's perfectly happy  to stand on his tariff policies.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are showing some signs of optimism this morning.   We've got a rally underway.  Dow industrials set to open up 120 points,  about half of a percent.  The S&amp;P is up 10 points right now.  And the  Nasdaq is up 35 points, that's one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>We are waiting on the second reading of the third quart GDP.  That is due  out in an hour and-a-half.  It is expected to be a GDP growth of 3.5  percent.  That will likely set the tone for markets.  So stay with us on  this because that number is coming.  And it is important in terms of its  impacts.</p><p>This after gains across the board yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now  back in positive territory for the year with 108 point rally on the Dow  yesterday at the close.  The S&amp;P was up just 8 points.  And the Nasdaq was  up almost 1 point.  Fractional moves there for the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story.  FT100 is down 15 points.  But the  CAC 40 in Paris is a quarter of a percent, 13 points higher.  And the DAX  index in Germany is up 11 points, fractional move there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board as you can see.</p><p>Google is betting big on real estate.  The technology giant is expanding  its holdings on both coasts.  We're taking a look at the state of  commercial real estate this morning and what technology -- how technology  is impacting it.</p><p>Then Apple is raising incentives for trade-ins.  Get this -- the company is  hoping it will help boost demand for new phones.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  And joining me to  break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and former Arkansas governor and Republican  presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Thank you.  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Happy to come.  Thank you and good to see all of you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I'm just warning you and  warning the viewers that the both of us will become more and more southern- sounding as the morning wears on.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Dagen -- don't go there.  You know we won't do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what I'm talking about.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You know what I'm talking about too, girl.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's going to be -- it's going to be the Clampetts before we're  over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are -- I want to see this, actually.  I want to see you both  get -- </p><p>We are watching the Federal Reserve today because Jay Powell is going to be  speaking.  What's your expectation in terms of what we're going to hear  from Jay Powell?  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  I think the market really wants  to see him be less hawkish, right, and more dovish because he said on  October 3rd that we are far from neutral.  And so the market didn't know  how to interpret that.</p><p>But we know there's going to be a fed rate hike in December.  They have to.   If they don't, then what are they seeing that the economy's not doing so  well, that they can't do a December rate hike.</p><p>So this is pretty telling what he says today.  And let's hope he's not as  hawkish on raising as many rates.  The market is anticipating for more rate  hikes this December and then three next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the next meeting is in about two and-a-half weeks or so.  </p><p>KELLY:  December 18th.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  December 18th on the meeting on the Fed.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to wonder how he's going to respond to the question of  President Trump and what President Trump is saying about Jay Powell.  </p><p>HUCKABEE: But don't we understand by now that President Trump says things  sometimes to be provocative in order to, like a magician, say watch this  hand and while you're watching it, he's doing something with the other.   He's a populist.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that what this is about then?  Let's talk here because I'm  doing something up here.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Absolutely it was.  And what he's saying is these interest rates  are going to affect some people and home buying and car buying right here.   So he's saying I'm the champion for the people who want the lower interest  rates but deep down he understands what's going on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's also trying to set Jay Powell and the Fed up as the fall  guys and gals if something happens in the economy and the market.  It's  about political messaging.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  People don't realize that he is a very smart and shrewd  operator.  And he's always going to land on his feet.  That's the one thing  that the press still hasn't figured out about Donald Trump.</p><p>He's playing them like a cheap fiddle and his song is, you know, a number  one hit every time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll watch the testimony.  We are going to take it live for  you.  So do tune in at 12:00 p.m. Eastern this afternoon when Jay Powell  takes to the podium.</p><p>Our top story this hour right now is President Trump doubling down on  border wall funding out of an important deadline next Friday.  President  Trump says he is, quote, \"firm in his insistence on $5 billion for the  border wall\", in an interview with Politico this morning.  He's willing to  shut down the government if he doesn't get that money.</p><p>House Majority Leader McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Schumer speaking  out on the battle over funding and what's at stake.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  The House version we  have $5 billion in there.  And the President is very strong on this.  I  think the President's very solid with where he wants to go and what he  needs to have a secure border.  </p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The Republicans are  in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate, a shutdown is on  their back.  Stick to the $1.6 billion.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is Texas  Congressman, House Energy and Commerce Committee member, medical doctor as  well, Michael Burgess.  Sir -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very  much for joining us.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Good  morning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the border wall.  What are your expectations?   You're coming from Texas.  You are a border state.  What are your  expectation in terms of getting that money for the border wall.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, I think it has to be the $5 billion figure that the  President has articulated.  And we saw from the images over the weekend  that people that actually were able to find their way through the fence.   Look, every senator that's over there that was here in 2006 voted for the  Secure Fence Act.  So they apparently believed it in 2006.</p><p>But it's apparent that the fence is not working.  And the President is  correct, the wall is necessary.  People are getting hurt because they feel  that this fence is something they can slide through and achieve their goal.   The wall needs to be there as a matter of public safety.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is it that the Republicans are not firmly behind this  president on this topic.  We know that there are many within your chamber  that actually wince when they hear that the President wants this money.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, I guess we'll see at the end of this week or the end of  next week, just exactly where everyone is.  But I think the President is  correct on this and he is correct to push on this.  And my belief is that  he will achieve what he needs to achieve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And coming from a border state, tell us why you think it's  important.  I mean do you have any anecdotes for us in terms of what you're  seeing in the state of Texas?  </p><p>BURGESS:  My district is not on the border, although I do travel to the  border a lot.  And what I have seen, my experience on the border in both  President Obama's administration and President Trump's administration is  that we really have no border at all and people are able -- the coyotes are  able to deposit groups of people -- 14, 16, 18 people, women, children,  teenagers on the United States side of the border.</p><p>The customs and border patrol then are obligated to take care of those  people.  And guess what, a mile up the river you've got all kinds of  cocaine, fentanyl and heroin coming across the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p>BURGESS:  It is unsustainable the way it is going on right now.  Keep doing  the same thing over and over again, we're going to get worse results.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are willing to shut the government down if the money is  not there for the wall then?  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, it wouldn't be me that shuts the government down.  It would  be senator Schumer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know but if you vote -- </p><p>BURGESS:  It would be Senator Schumer that shuts -- because the votes will  be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just heard what he said though, Congressman.  He just said  the Republicans are in charge of the executive office, the Senate and the  House.  It's on them.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Yes, correct, he is right.  And that is why Mitch McConnell this  time will have to revoke the 60 vote rule for cloture.  And will have to be  a simple majority over at the Senate.  I think it's pretty straightforward.</p><p>Otherwise you end up in a mess which is where we've been for several years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>Let me switch gears to GM.  There's more trouble here.  The President is  threatening to cut subsidies to General Motors after the automaker  announced its plans to cut 14,000 jobs.  It's shutting down five U.S.  factories next year.</p><p>The President is slamming the company and he did so in a tweet yesterday  sending GM stock tumbling to session lows.  It was down 2.5 percent  yesterday.</p><p>National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow reinforced the President's  frustration.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's disappointment that it seems like GM would rather build  its electric cars in China rather than in the United States.  We are going  to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others,  whether they should apply or not.  I can't say anything final about that  but we're looking into it.</p><p>Again, that reflects the President's own disappointment regarding these  actions.</p><p>Ms. Barra told me on the other hand, I want to be completely fair here,  it's her business -- it may be possible to transfer workers to other plants  in Texas and Michigan.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your predictions for the future?  Are you expecting jobs to be  transferred to Texas?  And should the President be brow-beating  corporations?  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, first the good news is that you're correct, the TexasGM  plant was not one of those ones that were targeted for closure.  So folks  in Arlington, Texas won't be faced -- won't be faced with that.</p><p>But look, back in 2008 right at the end of the Bush administration rather,  I was -- I was pilloried for not voting to allow the President to move TARP  money over to the General Motors, to not bail out the automobile companies.   I did not think that was a good idea but it happened.  And it was done.   President Obama then took credit for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BURGESS:  Look, the American people stepped up and gave money to that  corporation to keep it out of bankruptcy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BURGESS:  Many of us argued that a bankruptcy would have actually been a  more straightforward path.  Now they come back and say well, great that you  gave us this money but we'll be building these Bolts in China.  That just  doesn't -- people don't accept that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could understand that.  </p><p>Real quick, sir -- let me get your take on the big news for the Democrats  today.  House Democrats are facing this key vote to select the next speaker  of the house.  Congressman, your expectations for the preliminary vote  today.  Will Nancy Pelosi be the next speaker?  </p><p>BURGESS:  Yes.  And it will be a tragedy for the country.  You remember the  last time she was speaker, the economy cratered and then could not recover  until she was replaced as speaker.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House of Representatives is detrimental to  our economy.  And it will soon become evident to people just what a mistake  they have made in allowing this to happen.  But make no mistake about it,  Democrats will vote for their speaker, that's what they have to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the infamous comments from Nancy Pelosi was her  calling all of the tax cut \"crumbs\", the tax cut money, she called it  crumbs.</p><p>And now the House Republicans have this new tax package and they're facing  more opposition from Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats.  They say they were  blind-sided by the proposal.  The House GOP is unveiling the new round of  tax cuts this week</p><p>You and your colleagues want to pass this during the Congress' lame duck  session.  It would revive expired tax breaks, address glitches in last  year's tax plan, change savings and retirement related provisions.</p><p>Are you going to be able to get this over the finish line?  </p><p>BURGESS:  In the United States House of Representatives, yes.  And then the  door closes when Nancy Pelosi is speaker.  Again, I cannot stress how  difficult it was on the economy when this individual was speaker of the  house before.</p><p>Unfortunately, people do have short memories and they do not recall all of  the things that led up to the crash of 2008.  All were on her watch, all  were on her watch and then the recovery could not get off the -- could not  get off the deck until John Boehner was sworn in as speaker in 2011.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if that's what you're predicting, then I guess have you a  good shot to gain the majority back in two years then -- Congressman.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, I mean it's not about me or the majority, it's about the  country.  And we are entering into a dangerous time, I feel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- we'll be watching.</p><p>BURGESS:  But to answer your question, Democrats will have no choice.  They  have to vote for their speaker.  That is their rule.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Michael Burgess there in Washington.</p><p>Coming up, technology takeover -- Google is paying $1 billion for new  offices in the second biggest real estate deal of the year.  Details there.</p><p>Then more money in your pocket, how your old iPhone is gaining value.</p><p>Back in a minute.  Right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New information in Indonesia's Lion Air crash -- investigators now  increasingly focused on a potential maintenance problem.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is  interesting -- Maria.</p><p>Indonesian investigators say that Lion Air mechanics may have made a  mistake that caused the deadly plane crash last month.  A preliminary  report says maintenance workers have failed to repair a sensor on the  Boeing 737 Max.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Maria earlier this month, Boeing's CEO  Dennis Muilenburg said his company is fully cooperating with this  investigation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what happened?  Apparently there were 10 computers -- the  computer, it's about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the  plane went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went  wrong?  </p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO BOEING:  Yes.  As the Indonesian authorities have  all pointed out, initially there was some indications of an inaccurate  angle attack signal that was being sent to the airplane.  And of course, an  airplane has the ability to handle that.  We have procedures in place.</p><p>And we've already issued a couple of additional bulletins to our operators  and pilots around the world that point them back to existing flight  procedures to handle that kind of condition.</p><p>So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation as it  proceeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Well, taking a look at shares of Boeing, up 7 percent  so far this year.</p><p>Apple wants more owners of older iPhones to buy new ones.  The company is  raising the trade-in value of the older phones through its give-back  program.</p><p>So basically, you can get $150 for an iPhone 6, $200 for a 6 plus, that  doubled Apple's old trade-in value for those particular models.  There's a  lot on the list.  You can go take a look on the web.</p><p>Shares of Apple have been hit hard recently by concerns about slowing  iPhone demand.  Maybe this is their answer.</p><p>And then, ok you've heard a dog is man's best friend.  Maybe a dog is  woman's best friend.  A new study finds women sleep better when they share  a bed with a dog rather than another human.  They report that sleeping next  to their pooch is less disruptive.  The dogs give them greater feelings of  comfort and security.</p><p>If case you're wondering, Maria, women who slept with cats did not show the  same benefit because sometimes cats decide let's jump around at midnight  all over the apartment and then maybe dive bomb the bed, just as an  example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because dogs are more cuddly than cats.  WE know that.</p><p>CASONE:  Well.  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm a dog person.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Obviously -- that men are dogs, I guess it makes perfect sense,  right.  So there you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, that's an insult to dogs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do Charlie and Ramon sleep on the bed?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, of course.  Ella Bella always slept on my bed.  And I love  that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Charlie is a great, great pal.  Ramon has a mind of his  own.  Ramon has been sleeping in the living room lately.  I don't know what  I did to make him angry.</p><p>But don't say men are dogs because that's an insult to dogs.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I need to go down to the emergency room, get the blood stopped  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, a new way to watch -- how Audi and Disney plan on  creating content for self-driving cars.  Big story there.</p><p>Then oh, baby, Olivia is the second most popular girl's name this year.   The top names for girls and boys, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the big business of real estate with technology is  spreading to Silicon Valley.  Google is holding the two top spots for the  largest deals of the year in terms of real estate on the East and the West  Coast.</p><p>The technology giant is spending $1 billion for a building in Mountain  View, California and more than $2 billion for a building here in New York  City.</p><p>Joining us right now is Rudin Management co-chairman and CEO Bill Rudin to  talk more about real estate today.  It is good to see you.  </p><p>WILLIAM RUDIN, CO-CHAIRMAN, RUDIN MANAGEMENT:  Good to see you -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>First, characterize what you're seeing in terms of real estate in New York.   What companies are doing much of the buying?  Where you're seeing the  expansion and growth?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, we're heading for a near record year in terms of commercial  leasing, over 30 million feet already year-to-date.  So we've already  surpassed last year's record of 30 million feet.  So we'll probably be  north of 32 million feet of commercial leases done with companies like  Google, Zillow, WeWork, Peloton (ph).</p><p>And then obviously with the Amazon announcement it's an incredible, you  know, signal that New York really is a technology hub.  Our city is  diversifying its economic base with these large technology companies, small  technology companies, but reaffirmed by Amazon committing to Long Island  City.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm so glad you mentioned Amazon because the headquarters 2 --  HQ2 we're calling it -- Amazon has chosen Queens as one of the places.  The  announcement facing backlash though over incentives and nondisclosure  agreements involved in these deals.</p><p>So Amazon's move, were you surprised that they chose New York?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, our project in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, we have submitted  along with the city to try to get them to go to Brooklyn.  But we're very  happy that they've decided to go to Long Island City.</p><p>But I think, you know, some of these issues that are raised --  infrastructure, education, they will be resolved.  The fact that when  they're moving into the first building it's being vacated by Citicorp.  So  there's not going to be an impact in terms of population.</p><p>But as they continue to grow, the city's already committed, you know,  several hundred million dollars for infrastructure.  There's a new ferry  service.  There's education requirements as part of the deal.  </p><p>So we think it's net-net, you know, for the future of the city -- very,  very positive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think -- I mean that has to have legs, in other words.   Because Amazon is building this big project where it is, you say ferry, I  mean in other words, it's going to create a lot more economic activity than  what just meets the eye.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Billions and billions of dollars.  We're building a project right  now at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, not too far -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is Dock 72.  </p><p>RUDIN:  This is Dock 72, just not too far south of Long Island City.  And  we designed it with our partners Boston Properties and our lead tenant. We  work to really be the office building of the future.  It has all the  infrastructure, the technology.  It has the amenities.  It has a food hall.   It has a basketball court.  It has a conference center.  It has a wellness  center.</p><p>These are all amenities that companies like Amazon, Google and everybody in  between want to have so they can attract and retain their employees.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were just looking at it -- 675,000 square foot building  designed to integrate state of the art, modern class A office  infrastructure.  What does something like this -- how does it differ than  some of the typical buildings that you see in New York?  Why is this so  special and different?  </p><p>We work with WeWork, who is one of the preeminent shared office companies  literally in the world, to really curate and design the building to meet  the demands of the tenants of the future.  They want these amenities.  They  want the lobby to be a place where they can gather and talk to each other.   We can operate the building off of our iPhone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In other words -- temperature, lighting, you can do all that  from the phone.  </p><p>RUDIN:  We have a system that we created, our company called an Anthem and  we also have a building app so a tenant can order their food.  They get  delivered from our food hall downstairs.</p><p>They want to see when the next ferry is coming, they go to the app.  They  want to know when the shuttle is coming, they go to the app.</p><p>All of these things are looking to the future in terms of what companies  and their employees want to have this live-work environment and have a  place to enjoy themselves while they're working.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I love the pictures -- 14 feet floor to floor height with  eight feet of vision, unobstructed views of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Really  beautiful stuff.</p><p>RUDIN:  I'm going to have you as our rental agent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the demand and what you're seeing.  Is it  resonating?  I mean I want to ask you about domestic as well as foreigners  because for a long time the appetite for real estate by the Chinese was  very strong.  But apparently Chinese investors for real estate in the U.S.  has declined.  What can you tell us about that?</p><p>The \"South China Morning Post\" says Chinese inquiries dropped 11.4 percent  in September.  </p><p>RUDIN:  There's no question that the Chinese in terms of their appetite to  buy in the United States has waned.  They're selling product.  But we're  seeing other investors.  You see Canadians come in.  You see domestic  buyers come in.</p><p>And I think that just again shows the strength of particularly of New York  and the demand in terms of people wanting to be here and live here and  companies want to find the talent.  That's why Amazon came here.  They're  looking for the talent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So even though China real estate investment is down, it's still  number one.  </p><p>RUDIN:  No question about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Let me ask you your take on what you're seeing in terms of  the broad economy.  I mean real estate is a big portion of that.  So you're  talking about this booming situation right now for real estate and yet  markets are nervous, people are worried that growth is going to slow down  in the coming couple of years.  How do you see it?</p><p>RUDIN:  Well, definitely concerned about interest rates, and where the  interest rate market is going.  We're going to see the GDP come out today.   But we still see strong demand.  Housing -- there seems to be an  oversupply.  That markets have cooled down.  And we look at that as an  opportunity to come in, and as a buying opportunity for people that are  looking for homes, people looking to develop and find land a little bit  cheaper.</p><p>Hopefully this tariff situation gets resolved, so commodity prices will  start coming back down.  So those are big issues.</p><p>But we still see job growth.  And that really for our business drives our  decision in terms of where we want to invest, when we want to invest, and  what type of product we want to invest in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the project now in terms of filling it up?  </p><p>RUDIN:  We are about a third lease with WeWork as the main tenant.  They're  building out their space.  We have very good activity.  We'll be opening  the building early next year.  We have a direct ferry connection that the  city is putting in right at the foot of our building.</p><p>So we've seen very good demand and hopefully sometime next year we'll be  able to talk about some leases and I'll come back to you and tell you, you  know, who's moving into the building.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is an important client, an important tenant, WeWork.   I mean, they are expanding throughout the country.  What's your take on  WeWork getting so much of the capacity?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, we made our first deal with WeWork back in 2012-13, when we  net leased our building at 110 Wall Street to them.  And they did their  first WeWork, WeLive and they've obviously grown.  I think the value then  was $500 million.  Now we're seeing it over $40 billion.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's incredible.  </p><p>RUDIN:  And so, they provided incredible I think niche in the marketplace  for small companies and even large companies to find space on a flexible  basis.  That helps these companies grow and then hopefully they grow and  then they move into our building.</p><p>And at dock 72, we have the flexibility to make a long-term lease with a  tenant and if they want to take additional space on a short-term basis,  we're able to do that at -- with the We Work Space.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks beautiful, Bill.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, you mentioned the GDP.  We're getting the GDP out in an  hour.  We are expecting 3-1/2 percent growth for the -- for the third  quarter.  When we get that number, I see you today at the Jay Powell's  speech?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Am I going to see you at the Jay Powell's speech?</p><p>RUDIN:  I will be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will I and the Fed chairman is going to be speaking at 12:00  noon.  Are you comfortable with what's happening with interest rates, where  the Fed has been raising consistently, we're expecting another hike on  December 18th and then another three hikes next year?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, obviously, interest costs are a big component of our  business.  And we had 10 years of very, very low interest rates and it's  not surprising in our view that rates are starting to go up.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to slow things down a lot, though?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, I think hopefully not too much.  I think they're trying to  balance obviously inflation and the growth issues and employment.  But  we'll have to see what the -- what the chairman has to say in a couple  hours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will be there.  Bill, good to see you.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Bill Rudin, Rudin Management.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us, a lot to come.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning many happy Wednesday everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, November 28th.   Your top stories right now 7:35 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>The president against the Federal Reserve.  President Trump is telling the  Washington Post this morning, he is not at all happy with his choice of Jay  Powell as chief of the Fed.  That is ahead of the Fed chairman's speech  today at 12:00 p.m. at the New York Economic Club.  Fox Business is  covering that speech live.  We will bring it to you live at noon, so keep  it right here to get the chairman's comment.  </p><p>We will also have a second reading on the third quarter GDP in less than an  hour's time, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting the GDP to show growth in  the economy, of 3-1/2 percent.  We will have those numbers for you as soon  as they hit the tape and tell you how it's impacting markets.  </p><p>Right now, ahead of the number, Futures indicating a nice rally at the  start of trading, up 150 points on the Dow Industrials this morning, up 11  points on the S&amp;P and up about 40 points on the NASDAQ, going into the  numbers, we're now at the high of the morning in stocks.  </p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday on Wall Street.  Take a look, Dow  Industrials was up 108 points, almost one half of one percent.  The S&amp;P 500  was up eight points and the NASDAQ up a fraction, under one point higher  yesterday at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are mixed.  FT-100 is pulling back, down  about a third of a percent.  But the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 20 points  and the DAX Index in Germany also up 20 points, fractional moves there in  Europe.  </p><p>Asia overnight, take a look, higher across the board, best performer was in  Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Watching in the car, Disney is teaming up with Audi to help you pass the  time when you're in a self-driving car.  Wait until you see what they're  doing, details coming up.</p><p>A deal of pure imagination, Netflix is inking a deal to produce a series  based on the works of Roald Dahl.  </p><p>Plus, move over Lucas and Riley, we've got the most popular baby names for  2018.  We've got the list.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, oversees trouble for American  companies.  Facebook called to the Grand Committee on Disinformation in  Britain yesterday over allegations that's the company knew about Russian  data mining on the site as far back as October 2014.  Facebook's vice  president of policy solutions Richard Allan sat at the hearing next to an  empty chair left for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who did not show.  </p><p>Meanwhile, consumer advocates in Europe are filing complaints against  Google.  They allege the way the search giant tracks users' locations, that  it violates the European Union's data privacy law.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And judge, it is good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning --  good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all this?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, Great Britain, the parliament does not like it when you  don't accept an invitation.  I mean, this empty chair for Mark Zuckerberg  reminds me of political debates.  You've probably been through this  governor, where your adversary didn't show but you show an empty chair sort  of mock your adversaries at absence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it is sort of a poke in the eye, isn't it judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is -- it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you know, they're under pressure, go explain yourself.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Agreed but I guess his people and he's got the best and the  brightest (INAUDIBLE) around him have decided that this wasn't the time or  place when to do it.  Now, this is not a subpoena, he was not legally  compelled to be there.  But as for the essence of what's going on, the  European Union actually has stronger privacy laws than we do here in the  United States.  And some of the data mining gathering and sharing that  Facebook and the Google, for example, engage in probably does transgress  E.U. privacy regulations in a way that would not transgress American  privacy regulations.  That's issue number one that they're very concerned  about over there.  </p><p>The other issue of course is the substance of that hearing at which Mark  Zuckerberg didn't go.  Didn't you know that the Russians were using  Facebook to data mine and why did you permit it to happen and to whom did  you report it?  They actually have e-mails from some Facebook engineers  reporting it to management.  They just looked up the IPS numbers and knew  it was coming from that catering place in St. Petersburg which as we know  from Bob Mueller and others was the source of all the Russian hacking that  occurred in Russia but victimized us over here.  Same location.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see regulation on these technology companies,  do you think?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, I think you're going to see more regulation going  through.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the regulation look like -- what does the regulation  look like?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- I don't know what it looks like.  But I do know  that you don't have a First Amendment to worry about in Great Britain so --  or in the E.U. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So the regulation can be a little bit heavier.  Judges are far  less likely to interfere with it over there on the grounds that it would  impair the free speech rights of the gatherer, in this case Facebook, than  judges would be over here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But don't you think judge, that at some point, we're going to  see that regulation come here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think so.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, the AT&amp;T breakup --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been saying this for two years.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But yes, but I mean, the AT&amp;T breakup of several decades ago was  far less intrusive.  I mean, people could still get a telephone.  Now you  have Facebook and companies like Google and Twitter who are saying you  can't say these things on these platforms.  So it's really come to the  place where they are no longer just social media platforms, they are public  utilities.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know in my (AUDIO GAP) if you don't like (AUDIO GAP) go to  somebody else.  But there's very few somebody else's to which you can go.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Google --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Because the barriers to entry are so extraordinary.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The amount of money is so tremendous that would be needed to  compete.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the government --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but Google has what market share Dagen McDowell?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  90 percent of search.  They control 90 percent of search and  Facebook and Google combined control, what, 60 to 70 percent of all  advertising.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>KELLY:  There's two separate things here that were --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, can I just -- I want to point something out legally.   Because these companies are (INAUDIBLE) -- they are very much to your point  -- if you're going to censor content in the way that Twitter is more and  more, they're a publisher.  But these companies have liability waivers  based on the law right now from user generated content.  You watch those  liability waivers go away.  If they're going to act like a publisher,  you're going to get treated like one.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, McD as usual is ahead of us and is suggesting that if you  publish something on Facebook, Facebook's not liable for it.  And if  Facebook blocks it they're not liable to you for blocking it.  If Facebook  were to become just able to board where anybody could put anything on  there, then there'd have to be some sort of liability.  I don't know where  that's going to go.  </p><p>Quite frankly, Dagen, that is virgin, judicial and legislative territory it  has not been addressed yet in the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you speak --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I am loathe to have the government tell Facebook what to post  on their bulletin board because they're not the government.  They're not  regulated by the First Amendment.  They want to kick me out, they can do  so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking about a different judiciary system, what kind of a  judiciary system puts a guy in jail and then decides what to charge him  with?  That's Carlos Ghosn, the embattled former Nissan Chairman Carlos  Ghosn hired a former prosecutor now to defend him.  Ghosn was arrested and  accused of falsifying financial reports.  </p><p>But judge, he's sitting in a jail right now in Japan, sleeping on a cot,  eating porridge, being told you can't speak to your family, and they didn't  even charge him with anything officially yet.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, I don't want to sound snarky, but he's lucky they  even let him talk to his lawyer.  This is a system where when you're  charged you presumed guilty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's wrong.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's not a system when you're charged, when you're presumed  innocent.  It's not -- it's not a western based system.  There is so little  litigation and so little prosecution in Japan, that they believe -- I might  condemn it myself, but they believe that this is a successful system.  They  charge you, you're presumed guilty.  You have to prove your innocence.  </p><p>Now, he has hired an extremely aggressive prosecutor, the person who  formerly ran the office that's now prosecuting him.  Right, this would be  like getting arrested in New Jersey and hiring Chris Christie to defend  you.  I mean, that's almost literally what he's done in Japan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, judge, this really sounds like it's politically motivated,  that people within Nissan did not want to merge with Renault so they came  up with this stuff -- I mean, maybe there is wrong-doing here.  I don't  know obviously --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the allegate -- the allegations are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but there's no charges so far.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  The suggested allegations are income tax evasion.   The failure --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, $44 million.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The failure -- the failure to account for a large amount of  money in accordance with Japanese law.  But it is a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But he also was merging a French company and a Japanese company  and the Japanese do not want to be owned by a French company.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is reprehensible that the system exists today where you're  guilty until proven innocent but that's Japan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, judge, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you guys.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for getting me riled up.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>Coming up, Disney on the move, how the media giant is teaming up with Audi.  </p><p>Plus Liam, the second most popular boy's name this year.  What will be the  number one boys and girls names?  We will have the list for you, coming up.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Mike.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, Audi and Walt Disney teaming up to offer a  new type of media for self-driving cars.  Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, a big question mark on this one, Maria.  Think about the  future where drivers have -- well, self-driving cars.  What are they going  to do?  Well, Audi and Disney are working on a secret project.  They're  only calling, quote, a new type of media for those cars.  The big reveal is  going to be at the CES Trade Show in January.  But an Audi executive says  the new media will take full advantage of being inside of a vehicle.  They  also hit the tech could be used by back seat passengers in the near term.   What the media is, well, nobody really knows but taking a look at shares of  Disney, up more than four percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Netflix is bringing back Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.  The  streaming company has bought the rights to the stories of Roald Dahl and  they're going to turn them into animated series.  The books include Charlie  and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda.  </p><p>Many of Dahl's work have been turned into movies and Broadway shows but  this is going to be the first time they've become cartoons.  Production is  set to begin next year.  Shares of Netflix are higher in the premarket, up  more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Then there is this, the top baby names for 2018 are pretty trendy, to say  the least.  OK, according to BabyCenter, Sophia is the top choice for  girls.  That's the ninth straight year.  Jackson is the most popular boy  name for six years running.  But these are not the top choices.  Get this,  the name Ramirez has become popular, it's a character name from the hugely  popular video game Fortnite.  </p><p>And then, Kylie Kardashian named her daughter Stormi, that brought that  names popularity up 63 percent.  Apple didn't make the list this year.   Another random weird names I can't think off of the top of my head that  celebrities name their babies, but anyway, there you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like the list.  But Stormi.  </p><p>CASONE:  Stormi.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Are we sure that it's the Kardashians?  Stormi.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are you laughing?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  We had to go there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are you laughing?  I don't even know why I'm laughing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter by the way, insulted my name because they  disagree with my position on illegal immigration in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is insulted my name on Twitter the other day.  And I said, well,  you know what, at least I know what a period is and can spell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, making your dream job a reality, the secrets of  success.  Back in a minute.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Finding your dream job, according to new survey  by MidAmerica Nazarene University, just one quarter of Americans have  achieved this comfort level professionally.  </p><p>Joining us right now is career expert and the host of \"The Ken Coleman  Show\".  Ken Coleman himself is here.  Good to see you, Ken.</p><p>KEN COLEMAN, CAREER EXPERT &amp; HOST, THE KEN COLEMAN SHOW:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We want a deeper dive into the survey that  shows 12 percent of Americans yearn for a c-suite level position.  Tell us  about it.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Well, the bigger issue is that 25 percent, and that really lines  up beautifully with a recent Gallup poll that says nearly 68 percent of  Americans are disengaged at work.  So, you see those two stats coming  together and that's the real problem.  And so, when you see 25 percent of  Americans are in work that they really love, it's kind of sad given that  we're in America. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not enough.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  And that you have the American dream still very much before you.  </p><p>KELLY:  It's pretty fascinating because I think dream jobs, some people are  want to be YouTubers or bloggers or what have you, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or eBay sellers.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right, exactly.  And -- but how realistic is that and how do you  pair those -- the differences between the two, the realistic with sort of  the dream?  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Yes, I really appreciate that question, because dream job for so  many people sometimes is just all over the place.  What we do on \"The Ken  Coleman Show\" every day is help callers realize that they have the answer  for what they were created to do.  I believe were all created with talents,  things we do best and passions, things we love to do.  And the simple  formula to understand who I really am and what meaningful work is, because  that's what people long for, Kevin, is work that matters deeply to them.  </p><p>So when you look at I can use my talent to develop skills and use those to  do work that gives me great meaning.  This is what people are looking for.   And when you step into that role, it will really -- it really will be a  dream job because you go home every day fulfilled, even though you may be  tired.  And here's the best part Kevin, you wake up on Monday morning with  a spring in your step, not trudging to work with agony, which is really  where 68 percent of Americans really are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even when you wake up at 2:00 in the morning, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, again, I love coming to work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me too.  I don't mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is my dream job. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Getting up at 2:00 a.m.  I love it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do too.  And -- but I never sat back and thought I want to be  on T.V.  It's more of like how are you -- don't you talk your audience  through how do you figure out what satisfies you.  What rewards you.  For  me, it's working with somebody brilliant, harder working than anybody I've  ever known.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And supportive and so bright that you have this incredible  conversation.  That conversation is kind of, that's my reward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right back at you.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Here's the thing, we help people identify what is that Mount  Everest, that ultimate dream job.  But then, we take our eyes off of the  pinnacle and start with, where do we have to start?  You know, I liken it  to a mountain climb.  You know, you've got to train for that, you got to  prepare for that mentally, physically.  And there are stages on the climb.   Life's going to throw --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But still, becoming a business owner was the top spot in this  survey by a wide margin.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Sure, because that's the entrepreneurial dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because people love what they -- they're doing what they love.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  That's exactly right.  They say, you know what, this is a problem  that I see and I want to solve it.  That's what entrepreneurism is.  It's  that's a problem, I think there ought to be a solution and there's a  connection for me.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And Ken, you know, not always about money.  There are a lot of  people I see that love what they do, they do jobs many of us would not  enjoy at all.  They don't get paid that well but they love what they do  because they love life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to take money out of the equation. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I always say that, take money out of the equation.  Got to love  what you do.  Ken, great insights from you.  Thank you.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Thank you, appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Coleman joining us there.  </p><p>Still ahead, President Trump doubles down, why he's threatening to cut G.M.  subsidies, that's next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Good  Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November 28th.  Your top stories right now  8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.  </p><p>President Trump fighting the Fed.  The President lashing out at Fed  Chairman Jay Powell again.  It comes ahead of a highly anticipated speech  later today from Jay Powell at the New York economic club.  Fox Business  will have full coverage of his comments that begin at 12:00 noon.  Stay  with Fox Business to hear what the Chairman says about the economy and  interest rates now.</p><p>A new threat for General Motors meanwhile.  The administration may  retaliate against the automaker for announcing thousands of job cuts. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's disappointment that it seems like G.M. would  rather build its electric cars in China rather than United States.  There's  a lot of disappointment even anger.  I've heard it again from Mr. Trudeau,  from President Trump, from Democrats and Republicans. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are taking a look at the fallout on that this morning.   Meanwhile, investors are showing signs of optimism this morning.  Futures  indicating a rally at the start of trading up 150 points on the Dow  Industrials, two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P up 11 points, almost a half of  a percent and the NASDAQ 36 points higher.  A half of a percent higher  there as well.</p><p>In less than 30 minutes time, we will get the second reading on the third  quarter GDP.  The expect -- expectations call for growth in the GDP of 3- 1/2 percent for the third quarter.  We will see how that impacts market  after gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are  now back in positive territory for the year after 108-point rally on the  Dow at the close yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, not as strong.  Take a look at the indices here,  the FT-100 is down six points.  Fractional move there.  The CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 13 and the DAX Index in Germany is up six right now.  In Asia  overnight, gains across the board with the best performer being in Hong  Kong up 1-1/3 percent overnight.  The future of jobs in America, we are  taking a look at how Artificial Intelligence will transform the workplace  and how you do your job this morning.  We'll tell you about it.</p><p>Then, one of these things is not like the other.  Look at this!  This huge  cow is going viral this morning.  Look how enormous that car is.  We're  going to tell you why coming up and where that is.  All those stories  coming up this Wednesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly,  and former Arkansas Governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike  Huckabee.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks.  Good to be with all of you. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Futures are pointing up and  we've seen earnings come out, do spectacularly well that's helped make it  go up this morning.  We had sales force yesterday afternoon.  So, there are  technology bellwether in the cloud.  And then you also had Tiffany's today  where actually they met -- they missed on revenue but they actually met on  earnings and they're operating margins stable.</p><p>And that after they've been reinvesting in their business and you're seeing  that time and time again from companies where they're talking about  reinvesting their business and it didn't compromise margins.  So that's  pretty telling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you see in the salesforce.com numbers?  The cloud  obviously very important growth story for the economy.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Billings' growth actually was up 27 percent which everyone  was focused on and it seems like a company that can perennially grow at 20  percent.  And so that's really the focus because they've been such a leader  in the cloud for years and years and years and had high P.E.s, now that  starting to come down, they're getting free-cash-flow growth.  So you saw  it up -- it's up about 8-1/2 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  9-1/4 percent right now. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  There we go.  Yes.  Even more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Salesforce is going to be a real factor today.  And on Tiffany,  we've been having this debate about consumer for the last couple of weeks.   Did you see any cracks in the consumer and the Tiffany report?</p><p>KELLY:  No.  So actually the Tiffany report, they actually said the younger  shopper here in the United States actually helps support their sales here  in the North American market which is pretty telling.  They thought there  was going to be a slowdown in the Chinese market because they actually had  to cut costs.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they missed the same-store sales and the stock is down 10  percent.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So same-store sales has been that the one metric that is really  impact these stocks.  That's what happened last week.  I forgot what  retailer it was but it was the same store sales that sent the stock  reeling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Earlier they reported we're on the 630 hours.  So we've been  watching this.  So management is probably talking right now and it's -- and  more numbers are coming out.  So it's not good on the same-store sales.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will keep watching retail certainly as a big  component of the economy.  President Trump meanwhile is blasting General  Motors after the company's decision to close a manufacturing plant in the  United States and lay off thousands of workers, Edward Lawrence is at the  White House with more on that right now.  Edward, good morning to you.  </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.   Anger would be an understatement for the President and west wing here at  the White House now job cuts and the announcement of closing five plants,  four in the U.S., one in Canada sparked harsher criticism from two world  leaders.  President Trump tweeting out yesterday \"the U.S. saved General  Motors and this is the thanks we get.</p><p>We are now looking at cutting all of G.M. subsidies including for electric  cars.  Now we spoke on the phone with Canadian Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau who echoed the same disappointment.  The Canadian Prime Minister  tweeting out, we'll be supporting Canadian autoworkers and families  affected by G.M.'s plan to close its plants.  The White House Economic  Adviser Larry Kudlow spoke with the G.M. CEO and told her that she needs to  reconsider. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  There is disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than in the United States.  We are going to be looking at certain  subsidies regarding electric cars and others whether they should apply or  not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And politically this looks bad for President Trump who touted  manufacturing jobs coming back to the United States.  Economically, G.M.  says they have to make this move for the survival of the company.  G.M.  goes on to say that what happens to the plant in the U.S. will be a product  or a decision that will come out of auto union worker talks that will  happen next year.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Edward.  Thank you so much.  Edward Lawrence at the  White House.  We are certainly seeing a lot of conversation about that this  morning with regard to G.M.  Thank you, Edward.  Meanwhile, A.I. in the  workplace with Artificial Intelligence technology becoming more common, IBM  is now launching a new business with MIT to help companies adapt in a new  age of  A.I.</p><p>IBM says 120 million employees will have to be retrained by 2021 in order  to adapt to A.I.  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is IBM's  chief talent officer, Diane Gerson.  Diane, it's good to see you.  Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>DIANE GHERSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, IBM:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before I get to the training and all of that, you are the chief  officer.  Tell us what the right skills are today for employees to thrive  in this new era of Artificial Intelligence.  </p><p>GHERSON:  Well, look, it's a whole range.  Obviously, there is cyber  security skills, there's the data science skills, there's front-end and  full stock developer skills.  These are the hottest skills out there in the  market right now.  You're finding a shortage and every company is going to  have to start developing these skills because they just don't exist in  enough -- in enough numbers.</p><p>Every company is being turned into an Artificial Intelligence company of  some kind, a software company of some kind.  And whether it's a bank,  whether it's an industrial company as, you know, everyone is in there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even retail.</p><p>GHERSON:  Right, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, if you're not putting A.I. in your business, then  you're going to get left behind.  </p><p>GHERSON:  That's right.  And there is a shortage of the folks about with  the skills today.  So, the real challenge at every company is facing is,  all right.  How do I develop those skills internally and how do I create a  culture where everybody feels like it's my job to keep continuously  learning, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really fascinating.  </p><p>GHERSON:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how is A.I. changing what we do?  Give us some of the  examples of what A.I. does and how it changes the workplace.</p><p>GHERSON:  Yes.  I'll give you an example.  All of us apply for jobs, right?   And in the old days, if the company was looking for a job that would do  what was normally called a search and print, right?  You know, sort of you  put out some ads and you pray that the right people apply.  Now, the game  is so much more we understand who is out there because we've got all the  data.  And we go to people and we say, would you be interested?</p><p>Not only that but they can come in and take a look and they can say here is  my resume.  Find me a job that matches what I do.  And it might be in a  completely different field.  You might not even know that field exists but  because Artificial Intelligence understands enough about jobs and resumes  and if you have that experience and you must have the skills, it's able to  match you to jobs you never even dreamt of.</p><p>So that's something that we actually have on our Web site here in IBM and  it actually encourage more people than in any other companies to apply for  jobs because it's got that stickiness.  It's like OK, I could do that job.   I never dreamt of it, it says I have an 80 percent match when I apply.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  I like that.  Well, you know, you could imagine how A.I.  and machine learning, in general, scares people.  You know, we see these  robots who do things better than humans do and in all sorts of jobs,  robotics taking over.  I mean General Motors, recently announcing that it's  cutting 15 percent of its workforce.  Is A.I. to blame for that? </p><p>GHERSON:  Well, I think to a large extent it's because our employees in so  many companies haven't reskilled themselves to the future, right?  And it's  so important something that we do is we actually advertise to all our  employees, here are the skills that are declining that we will have a less  10 percent or more decline in demand for.  And here are the ones that are  growing.  And we encourage people to go and take those courses, take those  skills.</p><p>Get the training, move to new opportunities.  That's how companies have to  operate now.  You can't just go into a job and think, well, I got my  college degree, you know, I'm in jobs for like, that doesn't work you  anymore.  So that's I think a really important part of it.  And then the  other one is to be able to match people to openings to be able to say your  job is going away but this other job over here has a good match.</p><p>If you take these extra courses or this extra training and that's something  that Artificial Intelligence can help companies do.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, really important points that you make.  So you are  launching -- the company is launching IBM talent and transformation.  A new  A.I. fuel talent business to help build its modern workforce.  Tells us  about this and what this is MIT partnership.  </p><p>GHERSON:  Well, you know, it's a lot of -- lot of pieces to it.  We've been  at this -- as I said, you know, for four -- five years now, transforming  the skills-based of our company to match the new businesses that we are in.   Our portfolio has changed 50 percent.  So many other companies going  through this now and many of our clients have come to us and said, we like  what you're doing, could we do it too?</p><p>So this announcement of the talent and transformation business is really a  way of saying to clients we're in business with you, to help you do this  too.  And A.I. academy is one of those things.  So it's to help -- to help  train our clients, people, to learn the A.I. skills as they need for the  future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GHERSON:  In IBM, 2,000 people have taken it, they signed up, you know,  overnight, they wanted it so badly.  And it helped people in a variety of  different areas get prepared for A.I. in their field.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the coursework involved at this A.I. University?</p><p>GHERSON:  Yes.  It's got -- it's -- there is a variety as you might  imagine, there's a fair amount of coding, there's a fair amount of  understanding algorithms.  It looks at different applications of A.I. and  it's got a lot of tests.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can an older person in the workforce who has been on assembly  line learn this stuff now?</p><p>GHERSON:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And that's one of the most exciting  things about it, right? Is that it's not just for younger people, in fact,  what we found is our older employees have consumed more learning than our  younger employees because they know they need it.  The half-life of skills  is shrinking.  So their skills are less relevant than someone who just  walked out of school yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know we looked at the risks.  Do you see dangers risks for  A.I.?  And I know that it's hard to say, well, yeah, there are risks but  we're not going to change this because this where is the world is goings  but there are dangers, aren't there? </p><p>GHERSON:  You know, our experience is that it makes more meaningful jobs at  the end.  I'll give you an example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's critical is what you're saying.  </p><p>GHERSON:  In payroll, you know, we have people who are basically copying  one database to another database, submitting it to a vendor.  You know,  that kind of work.  That's all now done by automation.  But the people who  used to do that work are now doing higher level work.  They're -- we call  them job bands.  So job bands are higher.  They're the same people.  They  understand the work but they're not doing the more rote work that  automation is doing for them now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a great analogy.  Very quickly before you go.  How would  you characterize the jobs market right now?  What's your sense of the  economy?  You see a plot of applicants.  </p><p>GHERSON:  I think the market has shifted in the last six months.  And I  find it pretty amazing, it's very much a talent market.  It is not an  employer's market.  Talent has the power.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because there are more job opportunities and if you've got the  skill set you'll get a lot of offers.  </p><p>GHERSON:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great stuff.  Diane, great to have you on the program.</p><p>GHERSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>GHERSON:  Bye-bye.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Diane Gherson from IBM this morning.  Coming up.  Pressuring  Powell.  President Trump taking aim at his Federal Reserve chairman again.   We're taking a closer look at that and have full coverage and analysis of  the GDP report that's coming out in about 15 minutes from now.  Plus, odd  one out.  The story of this huge cow that's going viral, straight ahead.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, tension on Capitol Hill today.  Senators, getting  a briefing on Saudi Arabia.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines  now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The briefing is  going to be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary  James Mattis.  Lawmakers want more information on the administration's  relationship with the Kingdom amid its involvement in the war in Yemen and  the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>CIA Director Gina Haspel not attending the meeting, despite several  Senators saying her agency has intelligence at the Saudi crown prince,  ordered Khashoggi's killing.</p><p>Pompeo, recently wrote on Wall Street Journal op-ed stressing the  importance of America's relationship with that country, here is what he  wrote.  \"Saudi Arabia has also contributed millions of dollars to the U.S.- led effort to fight Islamic State and other terrorist organizations.  Saudi  oil production and economic about stability are keys to regional prosperity  and global energy security.\"</p><p>Well, Mississippi has decided.  Cindy Hyde-Smith has become the states'  first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate.  She defeated Democrat Mike  Espy in the runoff.</p><p>That comes, of course, after President Trump held two rallies in the  Magnolia State ahead of that vote.  President Trump tweeted about it.  Say,  \"Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big win great in the  great State of Mississippi.  We are very proud of you.  With her win, the  GOP has now expanded its Senate majority to 53 seats, versus the Democrats'  47.</p><p>And finally, all we can say about this next story is, holy cow.  You got to  look at this.  This is just the thing's huge.  Six foot four Australian cow  is named Knickers.  The videos gone viral.  Knickers weighs more than 3,000  pounds.  This makes him heavier than some cars, taller than some NBA  players.</p><p>You will not find Knickers on your plate, just to be clear here.  He's too  big to process, says the owner.  So, he's going to live happily ever after  on that farm in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>CASONE:  He's seven now.  He's kind of wild, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did he get that big?</p><p>CASONE:  They don't know.  That's the crazy thing.  They just said that the  cow just kept growing, they can't explain it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  How does he move?  She move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good, that is good.</p><p>KELLY:  I will beef up the jokes later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we got a few -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You got -- you, hey, you got a little more than 40 minutes to go  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the GDP coming up.  Meanwhile, Tiffany shares are  down.  They missed quarterly revenue estimates as we reported earlier, the  same store sales were an issue.  The stock down nine percent.</p><p>Salesforce.com is up big as Kevin told us earlier.  We've got that on the  other side of this break.  Then, science sparking outrage.  The details  after a researcher claims he helped make the first genetically edited  babies.  Big controversy here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a real controversial story here.  A  Chinese researcher is sparking outrage after he claimed that he helped make  the first genetically edited babies.  The researcher also revealing this  morning that a second pregnancy may now be underway.</p><p>This type of gene editing is banned in America and as the Associated Press  has noted, \"There is no independent confirmation of the researcher's claim,  and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by  other experts.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski,  better known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike, good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, CELEBRITY DOCTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really an interesting story.  But it's a technology  that allow scientists to alter the DNA of living cells.  And this guy did  it in an embryo.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  Maria, this is a story straight out of a sci-fi novel.   Because literally, what we're doing here is we're deciding what the future  generation is going to look like when we do gene editing.</p><p>There is incredible moral and ethical concerns when it comes to this, and  this is why the National Academy of Sciences had tremendous international  consensus when they said, \"If you're going to be doing human trials, you  have to be open about it, you have to go under ethics review, you have to  tell people what you're doing, and it has to be in a life-or-death case.</p><p>You have diseases like Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis that kill  people.  So, if you're going to be doing trials, do it on that.  This  gentleman did his trial in secret.  His hospital wasn't aware of it, the  university wasn't aware of it.  He was doing this in total secrecy, and  then he did it to prevent or, at least, hope to prevent an infection -- a  future infection with HIV.  This is not life or death, because we have  treatments for HIV.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  HIV is no longer a killer disease.  It's a -- it's a chronic  illness that we can control with medications.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said he altered a gene in embryos for seven couples during  their fertility treatments.</p><p>KELLY:  Can we trust that he was actually able to do this?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  I mean, it hasn't been independently reviewed, just how the  Associated Press said.  But it sounds like it's true, there was also a  doctor from the United States, a scientist that was working with him on  this that claim that this happened.  But there has been huge outrage in the  scientific community and rightfully so, because this is unprecedented.</p><p>Gene editing is going to be the problem of my generation.  A lot of people  are worried about immigration, economics.  But gene editing is the stuff of  nightmares.  I mean, you can literally create biological warfare with this,  you can create diseases that are not affected by our current treatments.   You can create soldiers with this that can be stronger the -- </p><p>I mean, there are opportunities here, endless and very scary to me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under the umbrella as if you are actually helping the trial of  helping -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  And in secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we don't know how the person will grow up.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's get to something lighter here.  Hold the  cream, pass the butter.  The latest coffee craze involves adding butter and  oil to your morning cup of joe as part of a popular keto diet.  Dr. Mike,  tell us about this.</p><p>Dieters are claiming this helps satisfy their hunger like a meal.  I don't  really think I want butter in my coffee.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well a lot of people claim that it makes them feel fuller, and  it probably does.  Because having a drink that has a high amount of fats,  they're using what we call MCT oil.  It does satiate your hunger hormones,  that is true.</p><p>Now, this keto diet, it's been a huge trend last year, this year, and it's  probably going to continue.  Because what we're finding is that diets that  are very low carb actually outperform low-fat diets.  And that's the big  story here because we grew up 20 years ago, 30 years ago talking about how  fat is bad and that's the danger to creating heart disease and all of that.</p><p>And what we're finding it's actually simple refined carbohydrates, sugars,  white breads, white pastas, white rice, eating those in large amounts is  actually what's going to courage you to gain weight, be unhealthier, and  increase the risks of diabetes.</p><p>KELLY:  I like it.  I do it, my wife does it.  Everyone should try it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have butter when you coffee?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, three times a week, at least.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're an animal.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, no, there are dangers of it.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  Do it.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  There are some dangers with it.</p><p>KELLY:  I look dangerously.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  You're like the new James Bond.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to my case.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  We'll be right back with the GDP, right  after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are about to get the GDP number out.  We are  expecting 3-1/2 percent growth for the GDP.  This would be the second  reading -- 3.5 percent is the number, right in line with estimates.  Let's  see if there's a market reaction.  We got a 3-1/2 percent growth number for  the second reading for the third quarter, and this was what we were  expecting, so it is a good number, certainly 3-1/2 percent showing growth.   We're going to dig deeper into the number and show you what it says about  consumer spending.  And as we bring in right now former Chief Economic  Advisor under George W. Bush, Ed Lazear to talk more about this.  And Ed,  it is good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ED LAZEAR, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH:  Nice to be  with you, Maria, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  3-1/2 percent growth for the GDP follows the second quarter  which was 4.2 percent economic growth.  In the second quarter now, the  third quarter 3-1/2 percent.  Your reaction.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, obviously, that's good news, this is a considerable step up  from where we were during the rest of the recovery, as you know we were  down around two percent.  So, this is a qualitatively quite different from  where we were.  Now, the question, of course, is what does this signify  about the future?  I think everybody always wants to know what the current  numbers mean for where we're going, the current numbers of the past or  obviously what we're most much more interested in is where the economy is  headed.  I would say a couple of things on this.  You just mentioned  consumption is good.  That was strong in these numbers.  Investment has not  been quite as strong in these numbers and that's a concern.  Housing,  autos, obviously are the weak spot in the economy right now.  So, if I were  going to point to something, I'd say that would be the major concern.  </p><p>But going forward, I always like to use the market as an indicator.  My  view is that the best forecast of the future is essentially what the market  is telling us, so I always base my forecast on changes in the S&amp;P 500,  which as we know has not been great over the past few months.  And so, if  you look at that, the market is essentially telling us, that the next four  quarters, we would expect something like two percent growth as opposed to  three percent growth.  Hopefully, the market got it wrong, and we'll be  able to revise that, but right now, that's where we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending was revised lower in this report and the  market is weakening here, any reduction to what the market is telling us on  this news?  Is this basically saying the Fed keeps up the rate hikes?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, two things, one is you don't want to look at, you know,  short-run movements in the market.  I mean, you know, certainly minute to  minute but even day to day, tend not to be the kinds of things that I rely  on.  I tend to look at something like three months or six months.  In terms  of the Fed, you know, the Fed is in kind of a difficult situation right  now, because they probably would rather have had rates high already and  have been at a place where they'd like to be, so they had some flexibility.   But they're -- you know, this is kind of the situation where you decide  you're an hour late for the ball, and the question is should you drive  twice the speed limit to get there?  And I don't think that's a very good  strategy for them, and I think, the chairman probably knows that.  So, in  terms of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And we're -- and we're going to hear from the chairman  today that the Fed chairman is going to speak at 12:00 noon, Dagen, and we  know that we are waiting for any expectations of what he says on inflation  and this growth number.  Your reaction? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- I was just looking into the number.  So you -- consumer  spending, it came in in the initial reading, it was running at a four  percent rate, and in this report, it came in at --</p><p>KELLY:  3.6.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- 3.6 percent.  Thank you.  I was looking through the --  through the write through on this.  But in terms of interest rates, The  Wall Street Journal, this morning, highlights the predicament that all  investors will be in with the Federal Reserve.  And how these speeches from  the likes of Jay Powell matter even more because we're going into the New  Year, fully expected that the Fed does hike at its December 18th, 19th  meeting.  But looking into 2019, there's a real split, do they raise two  times, three times, four times?  That is the outlook, it's really wide- open, so it creates the potential for more volatility in the stock market.   And not just stocks, but also the bond market and across all of the asset  classes that have sold off so sharply this year.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ed, this is Mike Huckabee.  What do you think is the key factor  that has driven the GDP to rise starkly since the last election?  I mean, I  think that's maybe a burning question, and if it's something tangible that  was done, why don't we keep doing it?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, that's a good question, and I think it's the obvious two  things that people always talk about, one is taxes and one is the new  regulatory regime.  So, if we're thinking about how this administration  views markets and business in general as compared with the last  administration, it's quite a different story.  So, if I'm an investor, if  I'm a businessperson, trying to figure out what to do in the future, and  I'm looking at the situation today, versus a situation three years ago,  this is a much more positive situation.  Now, you said, you know, what --  if this worked in the past, what can we continue to do?  </p><p>Obviously, we know there's a movement right now to try to do a bit more on  the tax front.  You know, that's going to be pretty tough sledding, I  think, in a lame-duck Congress.  But obviously, if it were to get done that  would have some effect.  Most of the action would come about through the  saving and investment vehicles, because that's really where the growth --  the growth lies.  It's the other stuff may be important, may be useful, but  in terms of affecting economic growth, it's primarily saving an investment  that does it.  If we don't have much action on that front, we're not going  to have much growth from the tax legislation even if it were to pass.</p><p>KELLY:  Ed, it's Kevin Kelley.  As we hit home about the household spending  grew 3.6 percent but it was down from four percent, and that was because of  lower durable-goods orders.  And we're talking about spending an investment  that you -- in order for our GDP to keep going at this.  Where do you see  first quarter GDP, and GDP going next year?  Because I can't drive looking  through the rear-view mirror.  So, we've had a great couple quarters but  everyone is worried that sugar high from the tax cuts are going to come  down.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Yes, I guess.  I don't see the tax cuts as so much of a sugar  high, people talk about it as a stimulus.  I don't think of it as a  stimulus.  I actually thought of the tax bill as moving to a more efficient  way of collecting the revenues that the government needs.  We -- virtually  all economists agree that the most pernicious tax in terms of economic  growth, is tax on capital.  So, the reduction in taxes on capital were a  positive factor in terms of long-term economic growth.  It's not just the  sugar high as you mentioned.  So, I would think that that would continue to  be a positive force.</p><p>Again, going for the, you know, the next quarter, the next four quarters,  obviously, the market is seeing something that it doesn't like today as  much as it liked a few months back.  And so, that's an important caution,  and I think the -- you know, the fact that consumption is a little lower  than it was is not quite as troubling to me, but the softness in the  housing market that we've seen over the past few months, I think is a  concern, and it's something that we need to keep watching.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's Dagen McDowell.  Why haven't the corporate tax cuts  resulted in faster business investment and business spending?  Looking at  this -- the second report on third quarter GDP.  So, the consumer spending  came in a little bit lower.  Business spending was a little bit higher,  among a couple of elements.  Business spending on equipment increased at 3- 1/2 percent rate, that's ahead of the -- </p><p>LAZEAR:  You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- four-tenths of one percent increase previously reported, but  that's still the slowest pace in two years.  So, why aren't businesses  stepping up?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, I would say it's a couple things.  First of all, there's a  change in the nature of investment in the last quarter.  As you know, if  you look at -- you mentioned durables and some of the other factors,  equipment, structures, have not been great, but on the -- on the  intellectual property front, technology, that's been pretty good.  So, that  was an offset there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important topic.  This is a really important  point that you're making.  This is also what I got from a leading figure in  the corporate world recently when I asked the same exact question that you  just did.  And he said that when you invest in things like technology, and  A.I., which those investments are soaring, that becomes a write-off, that  doesn't go in the category of business spending.  </p><p>So, while it looks like businesses have stopped or slowed down their  spending quite substantially, they may not be spending on the assembly line  but they're spending on technology which often becomes a write-off on the  balance sheet.  And so, it doesn't go into the category of spending, but  that spending is up big.  So, that's what you just said, and I was happy  you said that because that confirms what I had been hearing as well.   Sorry, continue, please.</p><p>LAZEAR:  That's right.  And the good news on that, of course, is spending  on technology has positive long run effects for us.  So, if you're talking  about future growth and you're thinking, you know, what are -- what are the  two most important things that affect the future?  It's primarily  technology and human capital.  So, investment in people and investment in  machines and new technology.  That's the way you make the economy grow.</p><p>So, hopefully, we'll see that pan out over the next few years.  Sometimes  these things have very long legs.  I don't know if you remember, Maria, but  there was a period when everybody was waiting for the I.T. -- all the I.T.  investments and all the innovation in I.T. to translate into manufacturing,  all kinds of increases, and it took a long time for that to happen.   Actually, it didn't happen until the late 90s.  So, sometimes these things  are slower than we would like, but the fact that we're doing that at least  is a good sign, not only from the accounting point of view that you -- that  you mentioned, which I think is an extremely important point, but beyond  that, just in terms of the structure as we go forward. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But to Dagen's point, do you think the investment in things  like, you know, assembly line, in deals, in other areas will come back?   Or, should we be looking at business investment in a different way?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, I -- you know, the -- I would say the second factor there,  of course, is the real interest rate, and we know that real interest rates  are rising.  And that tends to dampen investment, incentives a bit.  I  think, you know, as the Governor had mentioned earlier, the overwhelming  factor is going forward are the ones that really relate to taxes, to  regulation, to the whole administration's outlook on business in general.   And so, I would think that would be the more fundamental force, but you  know, we've had a -- hopefully, a blip in this quarter, and we'll see it  come back later on.  Again, to me, the most --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you mentioned rates -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>LAZEAR:  I'm sorry, go ahead, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, finish your thought.  Go ahead.</p><p>LAZEAR:  No, I was going to say, to me, the most -- the most concerning  issue is why the market is not -- is not seeing that, not reacting more  positively than it has been.  And my guess is that has a bit to do with the  slowdown in the global economy, and also, some of the sectors that you're  talking about here, particularly housing and autos.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you mentioned rates, Ed.  What's your take on President  Trump slamming Fed Chief Jay Powell?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did in an interview again yesterday with The Washington  Post.  He is blaming him for the recent stock market declines, he's even  blaming him for the layoffs at General Motors.  Here's the quote:  \"So far,  I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay.  And I'm not  blaming anybody, but I'm just telling you, I think that the Fed is way off- base with what they are doing.\"  Are they off-base?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, you know, the President's rarely reticent to criticize  people with whom he doesn't agree, and I don't know that Powell should be  any different.  I guess, I think -- yes, I think he is way off.  I think  that Powell has been doing a pretty good job, he's following a path that's  a stable and consistent path, it's careful.  It is getting to us the kinds  of rates that we really need for the long run.  So, I don't think there's  anything wrong with that, obviously Presidents always want to see lower  interest rates, particularly a President like President Trump who has a  background in investment and real estate and so forth, and likes low  interest rates.  So, it's not a surprise to me that the President would  like to see lower interest rates, but it's also not a surprise to me that  the chairman is acting independently and following his best judgment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just be careful what you wish for, Ed, because if you get lower  interest rates that's the market, if you're talking about longer-term  interest rates, that's the market telling you that the economy is headed  into the tank.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Yes.  Well, that's -- you know, that's right, I mean, the big  thing, of course, you always worry about is yield curve slope and  inversions, and so forth, and you flow, we saw that in spades when I was in  the government back, you know, during financial crisis. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LAZEAR:  And that is a concern, but, again, I don't see that as the major  issue right now, I think the major issue going forward, is do we continue  to have a pro-market kind of environment.  I wouldn't say pro-business, I'd  actually say pro-market.  This doesn't mean that you want to pump up  businesses, you want to make sure that the market is able to function.  You  know, everybody has been -- I'm sorry, go ahead, please. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, we're going to go.  But, Ed, just to be clear, you're  not expecting a big slowdown then in the next two years?  Very quickly, we  got to jump, Ed.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Right, I don't see a big slowdown.  I mean, it may slow some, but  I don't see a big slowdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Ed.  We'll see you soon, Sir.  Ed Lazear.  Stay with  Fox Business.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Live coverage of Fed Chairman Jay Powell 12:00 p.m. today.   Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump is tweeting this morning on the  Mueller probe.  Here's what the President just wrote:  \"While the  disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report  it that way, at least three major players are intimating that the angry  Mueller gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts and  they will get relief.  This is our Joseph McCarthy era!\"  Wow, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there's an argument made for what's going on with the Paul  Manfort, the rejection of the plea deal that's happening is that this is  his way of signaling -- there are a lot of reports out, I'm not going to go  into great detail about them.  He's way of signaling that the Mueller team  has tried to put pressure on him, and to set him up for potential pardon  down the road.  This is something that Andy McCarthy has -- was writing  about yesterday, I'll say that.  But if Mueller -- if Mueller pursues or  pushes for state charges against Paul Manafort, not at the federal level,  but at the state level, the President doesn't have any pardon power over  Paul Manafort in those instances.  So, there's a -- there are a lot of  moving pieces to this going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And my take on this is it's time, it's time for the  American people to know what Robert Mueller is working on.  It's time.   It's been two years, let's see what you've got.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Let's not forget the whole thing was about did Donald Trump  collude with the Russians to interfere with the election?  And if there's  no evidence of that, then the fact that Paul Manafort did some really  squirrely things when he was in private business, before he was ever  associated with Donald Trump, let us know that, so that we can quit blaming  the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- for something that had nothing to do with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, the notable guilty pleas so far in the Mueller  investigation, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn, those  are process crimes, those are lying to investigators, those are not crimes  related to Russia collusion.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But the media just fails to, you know, separate this,  and be -- and have honesty about it because there's been no evidence of any  collusion.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we got good news today.  The revised GDP number for the third  quarter up 3-1/2 percent in line with estimates.  The host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighing in in now.  And Stu, we were expecting a  good number, we got it.  You don't love the number.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't -- I'm not in love  with a 3.5 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want more.  You want more.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do, I do.  Well, look at this, in the second quarter, four  percent growth.  Third quarter, three percent growth.  Fourth quarter,  we're looking at 2 percent growth.  I don't like a down trend, I want a  solid up trend.  That's what I want to see, and I don't think we are going  to see that.  And by the way, if I can just say this, you're dead right on  Mueller, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY:  What do you got?  Show it, two years?  Put it on the damn table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Come on.  Come on.</p><p>VARNEY:  Excuse me.  Put it on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's enough.  Enough with the speculating.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Alan Dershowitz said yesterday, he thinks that the Mueller  report comes out before the Democrats take the House -- takeover the House  in January.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if we get it by year-end.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's his speculation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what does it say?  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  We  know you've got a lot in the show.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart  and his fantastic panel.</p><p>But first, we are driving into the future, next.  We're checking out the  coolest cars at the L.A. Auto --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Driving into the future, Jeff Flock live at the  Los Angeles Auto Show, checking out the coolest cars this year.  Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Although, I tell you, the  cars may take a backseat to the news.  I'm at the G.M. exhibit, Chevy, GMC  that sort of thing.  You know, it was weeks ago that G.M. told us, and we  were puzzled why there weren't any executives going to be at the L.A. show.   And we're not so puzzled anymore.  Take a look at the Presidential tweets.   I need to get my glasses out to read them.  \"Very disappointed with General  Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan, and  Maryland.  Nothing being closed in Mexico and China.  U.S. saved General  Motors, and this is the thanks we get?  We're looking at cutting G.M.  subsidies including for electricity cars.  G.M. made a big bet in China  years ago when they built plants there, and in Mexico, don't think that bet  is going to pay off.  I'm here to protect American workers!\"</p><p>Well, you know, we'll see.  That's the buzz of the show, though.  Other  buzz, look at the Beetle.  That is the last edition of the Beetle, do you  believe it?  Well, I don't know if you can believe it.  They say it is.   But if you spin around -- spin over here, you remember, there was a last  edition of the Beetle before, that's the real old Beetle.  </p><p>By the way, I'll leave you with this, Maria.  That over there, the blue and  white, that is an electric cargo van that the V.W. is also now going to  sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  All right, Jeff, thank you so much.  Some cool -- some  cool wheels there, Jeff Flock.  Forget --</p><p>Coming up, forget hot chocolate, details on the new winter drink from  Starbucks that tastes like juniper and sage.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, we're expecting a big open on the upside.   But look at Tiffany shares, down 12-1/4 percent right now on the same-store  sales weakness, and the earnings news we told you about earlier.  Gerri  Willis on the floor of the New York Stocks Exchange with more.  Gerri, good  morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right, Tiffany is down as much as 13 percent premarket, after the company  registered lower-than-expected earningsm, $0.77 a share versus $0.78.   Profits down on higher-than-expected investment spending on stores and also  a charged they didn't expect to take for the bankruptcy of a precious  metals refinery.  So, those shares down.  Same-store sales also not  terrific.</p><p>Meanwhile, Burlington, let's talk about that company, it's the opposite  side of the equation.  That stock up dramatically this morning, seven  percent on higher-than-expected earnings.  The discount store chain doing  very well indeed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the big story that everybody is paying attention to today,  Starbucks with their juniper sage latte.  I have it right here in my hot  little hands, tried it, I've got to tell you, not loving it.  It's like  drinking your Christmas tree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri, sorry about that.  Gerri Willis, we'll check  back.  Big opening, coming up.  Final thoughts real quick, you guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, listen, the White House doesn't have  to do anything to take away these subsidies from General Motors.  They  began expiring shortly as soon as G.M. hits that 200,000 vehicle mark.   They have to stand back and say, you don't get anymore.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

How  are you?  Thank you so much.  Happy Wednesday, ladies.  We will see you in  a few minutes.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good morning, everyone, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  We're happy you're here.  It is Wednesday, November 28th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump versus Fed Chairman Jay Powell.  The President lashing out  at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p>It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this  afternoon, 12:00 noon.  </p><p>Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on.  The focus on President Trump's working  dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.  </p><p>The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air. </p><p>And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  There's disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than the United States.  </p><p>We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and  others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump confirming that possibility.  We are looking at  the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at  futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent.   S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.  </p><p>We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning.   We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for  the third quarter.  </p><p>Markets are up ahead of that.  </p><p>Gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p>The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points.  The NASDAQ was up eight  points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point,  and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third  of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the action is mixed.  FT-100 pulling back a  fraction, but the CAC Quarante is up 21 points, and the DAX Index in  Germany up 28 points.  It's good enough for a quarter of a percent gain in  Germany.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board, take a look at the best  performers there, Japan, Hong Kong, China, all up better than one percent  overnight.  </p><p>Cindy Hyde-Smith holds on, the republican beating democrat Mike Espy to  keep her Mississippi Senate seat, bringing the latest in that late results.  </p><p>Plus LeBron James looking beyond basketball.  Details on his new venture  with Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lindsey Vonn in wellness,  offering energy powders and supplements.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and former Arkansas Governor,  Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee.  </p><p>Great to see you this morning. </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be with you, Maria.  Thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Good morning. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Good morning.  Hopefully, we get  the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's  anticipating that. </p><p>That's a great quarter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be a good quarter. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  We need it.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the President going after  General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax  credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down  for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've  hit this threshold.  </p><p>So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't  have to do anything.  They just have to step back and not extend it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the subsidies go away on their own. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer.  Tesla  already hit it recently.  </p><p>General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so  gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say,  \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these  billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government  Motors.  I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm  done with them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.  </p><p>And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're  not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel  and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump  administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing  them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what  Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S.  has been for a long, long time. </p><p>KELLY:  That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to  corporations?  I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Nope.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers?  So.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  We shouldn't be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- and there was the bailout. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why this is such a particularly important story  because a few years ago -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is the company that was bailed out.  Got a lot on the  table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General  Motors. </p><p>KELLY:  Crony Capitalism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point that out.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yup.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big number, yes, you're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Exactly right, Kevin.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and  member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.  </p><p>Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former  Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.  </p><p>Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.  </p><p>Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  </p><p>Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us.  Dr. Mike is going to joining us  as well.  Lots to talk about there.  </p><p>But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again.  The  President continues his campaign against Powell.  President Trump  criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.  </p><p>In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and  layoffs at General Motors.  </p><p>The President says this.  \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my  selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm  just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're  doing.\"</p><p>This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will  be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth  Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee. </p><p>Michael, good to see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH:  Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.  </p><p>LEE:  So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success  in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher. </p><p>And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for  forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to  your economy over time. </p><p>When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no  inflation.  We need higher interest rates in this country. </p><p>I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long  overdue.  </p><p>And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the  macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks. </p><p>The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and  Bank of America which loans they can and can't make. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>LEE:  Right?  It just -- it shouldn't work like that. </p><p>And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching  overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.  </p><p>So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the  regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.  </p><p>So, I think the President made right choice.  I think he's unhappy with the  reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe.  But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the  Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as  the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the  impact of these rate hikes.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>KELLY:  Well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you really need four rate hikes this is year? </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close  to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say  we need to get back to neutral. </p><p>And guess what?  Guess who would agree with me?  Candidate President --  Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said  interest rates were too low.  </p><p>And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're  barely at breakeven rates.  </p><p>If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is,  it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?  </p><p>You can even have negative real interest rates.  </p><p>So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington  Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the  fed because his exact quote was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut.  My gut tells me  more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p>He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\"   Well, guess what?  President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated  by the fed.  </p><p>Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy,  and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't do any fiscal policies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are  going higher?  </p><p>We were at negative.  We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We  got to get back to normal.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in  a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used  to that. </p><p>Let's talk about policy over personality.  That's -- we're all used to  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  Good.  Good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you  know what, that's who the American people elected, number one. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Good.  I like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise.  People  automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead. </p><p>He's not being hot-headed about this.  He's a real estate developer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the  -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this  country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for  six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for  eight straight months.  </p><p>Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the  economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral?  Are we  in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a  world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in  the last 30 or 40 years?  </p><p>Eight percent mortgage?  I don't think that this economy can handle that,  so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And I don't think that's normal.  Is that normal? </p><p>KELLY:  That's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that the -- </p><p>KELLY:  That's (INAUDIBLE) housing.  Housing isn't affordable in a lot of  these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't  have speculation in the housing market. </p><p>And that's what they're preventing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's a reason why mortgage  rates are going to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not their job.  Their job isn't to prevent speculation. </p><p>KELLY:  Their -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Their job isn't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Their job is to prevent runaway inflation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Runaway inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what -- </p><p>KELLY:  And what happens when housing inflations go up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the runaway inflation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But there's no -- there isn't.  </p><p>KELLY:  There's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's no inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what my point is, is that -- </p><p>KELLY:  Inflation is picking up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not. </p><p>KELLY:  That's why they're raising rates.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not.  And it's actually very, very tame.  </p><p>KELLY:  What housing market are you looking at? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p>LEE:  I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the  interest rate. </p><p>As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was  cost rates were much higher than they are right now.  </p><p>Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're  not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is  available, rates can be much, much higher.  </p><p>So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage  and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.  </p><p>So, as rates move higher, okay?  And credit availability increases, which  it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I  believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone  pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again.  That's  changing. </p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened  since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's  changing.</p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened  since the election has changed that, okay?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine  moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.  </p><p>We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is  going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page  story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed  is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.  </p><p>It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to  perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of  inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the  markets.  </p><p>That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article.  But -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP  today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and  a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.  </p><p>Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike,  but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at  noon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know you're going to be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to be there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read  on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision  in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy  in general.  </p><p>Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up  this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.  </p><p>The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi  Jinping.  </p><p>National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible  breakthrough in the trade talks. </p><p>He said this yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a  deal and he is open to it.  </p><p>But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago  are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's  perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here  actually? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with  China.  </p><p>But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.  </p><p>I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but  to everybody.  </p><p>And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're  used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach  has gotten our heads handed to us.  </p><p>And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations,  does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.  </p><p>And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between  America First and America Only.  They think that he's, you know, some  nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not  true.  </p><p>But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the  American President and thank God for it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that  China has been abusing -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- has been the bad actor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has been stealing IP.  </p><p>Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with  China at this point? </p><p>LEE:  Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic  breakthrough at this dinner.  I would -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LEE:  I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these  tariffs down the road.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I think you're right because -- </p><p>LEE:  -- and continue talking, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>LEE:  Yes.  You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally,  but that's short-term.  </p><p>This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going  away.  </p><p>The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to  open up markets and for peace and prosperity. </p><p>BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.  </p><p>You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and  they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.   There's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning they want to be number one in all the important  industries. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, including military.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Michael, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>LEE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael Lee there.

Big tech continues to move into health care, it  is raising fresh privacy concerns, though.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details on that.  Lauren, good morning. </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this,  you might appreciate what they're doing.  Let me explain.  </p><p>So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your  health data, your medical records.  </p><p>Why are they doing this?  Well, they want to make money, health care is a  $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save  money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first  time. </p><p>And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their  press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you  have software, and algorithms.  </p><p>And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical  text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the  limiting resource is time.  So, that's where they can come in and help.  </p><p>It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right  patients and the right drug trials.  </p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care.  Here's Toby  Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are now an Advisor to Google.  </p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is  spending the resources on healthcare expertise. </p><p>COSGROVE:  You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the  high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether  watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or  Amazon and Google as well. </p><p>Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a  problem and, B, an opportunity.  </p><p>The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is  doubling every 73 days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an incredibly stat.  </p><p>COSGROVE:  Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage  all this data. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data  being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine  learning. </p><p>COSGROVE:  Exactly.  Well, on top of that, it also gives you  interoperability. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going  through you data in the first place with not getting hacked? </p><p>So this is the way we're moving, you know.  You go to the doctor now, the  doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an  iPad.  You see it all the time.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We're there. </p><p>Do we trust algorithms? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us,  Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has  a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this  vehicle, they can perform many of the things.  </p><p>And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person,  the more important.  </p><p>So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it  takes in the vehicle.  It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit. </p><p>So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really  life-saving.  </p><p>It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I  recognize that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person  that she went to see for it missed it.  She was stroking for about five  days. </p><p>So, again, whatever it takes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for these doctors.  </p><p>And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even  just the management of the drugs that you're taking.  With my mom having  stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the  drugs that she has to take.  </p><p>Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital,  there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four  years ago.  </p><p>Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for  particularly catastrophic illness.  </p><p>And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech  companies with the data?  Why do we trust the government, governor?  </p><p>Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of  health information, why do we trust the government over big companies? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who says we trust them?  I don't trust any of them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why I said that. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach  company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer  living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes  over to our homes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and  listens to us.  Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off  because they are -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So -- exactly.  So while there are risks in terms of privacy  and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the  positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care  outweigh it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I  would trust Amazon and a big tech company.  </p><p>Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands  of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting  digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple  would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then  say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong  address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been  performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon  basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  I -- that's amazing that  data is doubling every 73 days in health care.  Lauren, thanks.  Lauren  Simonetti.  </p><p>Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the  company's plan to restart search engine operations in China.  More of the  fallout there.

Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the  start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65  points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent  higher, right now.</p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials  picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the  S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very  much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up  eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points,  fractional moves here.</p><p>Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent  in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p>Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go  ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that  this morning.  Plus -- this, ahead of President Trump's upcoming meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, later  this week.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather, Sidney, Australia, hit by its average monthly  rainfall over the course of two hours.</p><p>And a new venture, LeBron James teams up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Cindy Crawford, for wellness.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Wednesday morning, but first, this top  story, this half an hour, partisan divide over more tax cuts, House  Republicans now having a new tax package, facing opposition from Democrats,  who say they were blindsided by this proposal.</p><p>The House GOP unveiling their new round of tax cuts, this week, hoping to  pass it during Congress' Lame-Duck Session.  The package would revive  expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change  savings and retirement-related provisions.  Here's contributor from The  Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk  more on taxes.</p><p>Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this.  We've  been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months.  What's  your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done,  in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p>TATE:  Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety  of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and  the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you  mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of  disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's  tax law.</p><p>It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that  the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats  objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts,  permanent.</p><p>Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats  would have to agree to it and come on board.  But I've got to tell you,  Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this.   The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p>And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial  stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was  put together without their input.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time  around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan.  And as you say,  Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking  about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not controversial at all.  But again, I don't -- the  Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you  make better decisions with your money, number one.  Number two, they are  not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, they're not.  But this is something the Republicans could  have and should have done.  They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to  come through.  They've got the votes between now and January.  And as Larry  the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know  this tax bill will get crushed, right?  Is it going to be middle of  December, is our last hope?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out  because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p>TATE:  Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has  a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic.  A  lot of this is about political optics, too.  I mean, the Democrats do not  want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law.   They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing  progress.</p><p>And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating  over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear  what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this  package that the President has been talking about because in addition to  making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants  to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do  you know, Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be.  It's  one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but  unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is  never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget  that they were elected by one 435th of the American population.  The  President was elected by the entire country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why is he still there?  He said he's stepping down, and  yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas  that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a  year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p>So, we ask, why now?  Why the subpoenas coming out now?  I don't mean to  change the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  And I think that was so inept, I have to  say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta  Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner?   And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's all about the money.  It's who the donors are and how  they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has  been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with  obligations to all the donors.</p><p>He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental  difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more  effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  President Obama attending the  Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president  took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only did I not  get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way,  was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about.   In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to  get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p>TATE:  Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney  general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn  over documents requested by Congress.  His other attorney general, Loretta  Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill  Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton  were dropped.</p><p>But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time  right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming  from a former president.  I mean, right now, we are at the point where  leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs,  you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and  Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p>We need rhetoric that brings people together.  And by the way, I've been  equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well.  But, you  know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TATE:  He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against  his political enemies from the IRS -- </p><p>TATE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that  we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go  low, well, we're right there with you.  President Trump speaking and  communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us  see who all these people are.</p><p>And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make  jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense.  Again, they're all --  they're all the same, all of them.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in  particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because  they were protected.  Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an  illegal server.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I  think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted,  anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class  throughout their administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for  Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, think about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is such a good point.</p><p>KELLY:  Strzok and Page too.  I mean, that sets an example.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You call it a matter, not an investigation.  And that's  exactly what he did, he called it a matter.  Kristin, it's great to get  your insights always, come back soon.</p><p>TATE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there.  Coming up,  Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the  torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater.  Then, Krispy  Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which  features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time.   Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial  China search projects.  Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  We have been talking about this for a while, Maria.  Some workers  at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in  China.  At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers  published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative;  it's known as Project Dragonfly.  They say it's a \"censored search engine  for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\"  The browser will  allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten  dozens of signatures in addition.  Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are  up less than one percent for the year.</p><p>Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia.  More than  500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average  monthly rainfall within just two hours.  About a dozen people had to be  rescued from their cars; they were trapped.  And thousands of homes lost  power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.  </p><p>Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size  Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story.  This is crazy.  He spent  almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to  sail now from Holland to Israel.  He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it  only makes sense to take it to God's land.  One problem: there's no motor  in the ark.  And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can  rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically.  So,  we'll see if he raises the money.  </p><p>And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this  year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes!   Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin  candy.  And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return.  Looks  like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside.  A  holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut.   All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts.  I apologize  now, Maria.  I failed you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that  story, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Very sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters.  Remember our ugly  Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  </p><p>CASONE:  So much fun.  I saved mine, by the way.  I'm ready to go for this  year.  It is coming back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There we are.  Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are  coming to you with our ugly sweaters there.  Dagen, that was fun.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered  yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them  delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  I appreciate that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I did.  It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE).  And I still have it.   I've worn it multiple times --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, I like your reindeer sweater.  Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think mine had a nose on the --  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Says who?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't need one for Christmas, there you go.  So, don't get me  one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron,  how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a  path toward healthy living.  We'll tell you about the products next up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and  charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the  details, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria,  considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and  all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were  shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington  Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers.  While Foster is  not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team  facility.  Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent  allegations against him.  A lot of his former teammates who is are now with  the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the  decision to bring him on board.  </p><p>Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service,  joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of  live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.  </p><p>Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose  reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball.  Rob Manfred  yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling  operation.  Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM  Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly  suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out,  the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.  </p><p>What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy  Crawford, Lindsey Vonn?  A health and wellness company that they have  formed called Ladder. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL:  They say, you should do this alone.  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  That if you want  something done right, you have to do it yourself.  </p><p>LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER:  They say you should never ask for  help.  </p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER:  We say, there's strength in  numbers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these  four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines.  There's  going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're  going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build  the ladder to wellness.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it wellness or protein powders?  I mean --</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is protein powder wellness?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say.  So,  there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way.   Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day,  get off of your butt and get running.  That's the ticket to health and  wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner.   Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did  was terrible but let's do some gambling.  </p><p>MAX:  And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of  fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this  morning, they have to get real on this.  </p><p>KELLY:  Pete Rose meet the deadline, though.  Didn't he have only so many  years he could be elected in?  </p><p>MAX:  You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader.  (INAUDIBLE),  did he bet against his own team?  Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough  already.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, you --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, I just want to say amen.  Amen and amen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  Amen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's why I like Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah.</p><p>MAX:  I like this guy too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good sports stories today, Jared.

Good Wednesday  morning, everybody.  Good morning to you.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, November 28th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump is doubling down on the border  and the funding.  In a new interview with Politico, he says he's willing to  shut down the government over getting that money to build the wall.   Reaction this morning from Capitol Hill coming up.</p><p>President Trump is also fighting the Fed.  The President lashing out at Fed  chairman Jay Powell again yesterday.  This comes ahead of a highly- anticipated speech from Powell this afternoon. </p><p>Fox Business will take you there live.  We have full coverage of the  chairman's comments today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern.  He is speaking at the  Economic Club of New York.  Stay with us for that speech.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are on G-20 countdown, the focus is on President Trump's  working dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday in Argentina  at the G-20 meeting.  The question on whether they make a deal on trade is  still up in the air.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  The President said there  is a good possibility that we can make a deal and he is open to it.  But on  the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago are not  met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's perfectly happy  to stand on his tariff policies.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are showing some signs of optimism this morning.   We've got a rally underway.  Dow industrials set to open up 120 points,  about half of a percent.  The S&amp;P is up 10 points right now.  And the  Nasdaq is up 35 points, that's one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>We are waiting on the second reading of the third quart GDP.  That is due  out in an hour and-a-half.  It is expected to be a GDP growth of 3.5  percent.  That will likely set the tone for markets.  So stay with us on  this because that number is coming.  And it is important in terms of its  impacts.</p><p>This after gains across the board yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now  back in positive territory for the year with 108 point rally on the Dow  yesterday at the close.  The S&amp;P was up just 8 points.  And the Nasdaq was  up almost 1 point.  Fractional moves there for the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story.  FT100 is down 15 points.  But the  CAC 40 in Paris is a quarter of a percent, 13 points higher.  And the DAX  index in Germany is up 11 points, fractional move there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board as you can see.</p><p>Google is betting big on real estate.  The technology giant is expanding  its holdings on both coasts.  We're taking a look at the state of  commercial real estate this morning and what technology -- how technology  is impacting it.</p><p>Then Apple is raising incentives for trade-ins.  Get this -- the company is  hoping it will help boost demand for new phones.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  And joining me to  break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and former Arkansas governor and Republican  presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Thank you.  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Happy to come.  Thank you and good to see all of you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I'm just warning you and  warning the viewers that the both of us will become more and more southern- sounding as the morning wears on.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Dagen -- don't go there.  You know we won't do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what I'm talking about.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You know what I'm talking about too, girl.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's going to be -- it's going to be the Clampetts before we're  over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are -- I want to see this, actually.  I want to see you both  get -- </p><p>We are watching the Federal Reserve today because Jay Powell is going to be  speaking.  What's your expectation in terms of what we're going to hear  from Jay Powell?  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  I think the market really wants  to see him be less hawkish, right, and more dovish because he said on  October 3rd that we are far from neutral.  And so the market didn't know  how to interpret that.</p><p>But we know there's going to be a fed rate hike in December.  They have to.   If they don't, then what are they seeing that the economy's not doing so  well, that they can't do a December rate hike.</p><p>So this is pretty telling what he says today.  And let's hope he's not as  hawkish on raising as many rates.  The market is anticipating for more rate  hikes this December and then three next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the next meeting is in about two and-a-half weeks or so.  </p><p>KELLY:  December 18th.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  December 18th on the meeting on the Fed.</p><p>KELLY:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to wonder how he's going to respond to the question of  President Trump and what President Trump is saying about Jay Powell.  </p><p>HUCKABEE: But don't we understand by now that President Trump says things  sometimes to be provocative in order to, like a magician, say watch this  hand and while you're watching it, he's doing something with the other.   He's a populist.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that what this is about then?  Let's talk here because I'm  doing something up here.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Absolutely it was.  And what he's saying is these interest rates  are going to affect some people and home buying and car buying right here.   So he's saying I'm the champion for the people who want the lower interest  rates but deep down he understands what's going on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's also trying to set Jay Powell and the Fed up as the fall  guys and gals if something happens in the economy and the market.  It's  about political messaging.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  People don't realize that he is a very smart and shrewd  operator.  And he's always going to land on his feet.  That's the one thing  that the press still hasn't figured out about Donald Trump.</p><p>He's playing them like a cheap fiddle and his song is, you know, a number  one hit every time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll watch the testimony.  We are going to take it live for  you.  So do tune in at 12:00 p.m. Eastern this afternoon when Jay Powell  takes to the podium.</p><p>Our top story this hour right now is President Trump doubling down on  border wall funding out of an important deadline next Friday.  President  Trump says he is, quote, \"firm in his insistence on $5 billion for the  border wall\", in an interview with Politico this morning.  He's willing to  shut down the government if he doesn't get that money.</p><p>House Majority Leader McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Schumer speaking  out on the battle over funding and what's at stake.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  The House version we  have $5 billion in there.  And the President is very strong on this.  I  think the President's very solid with where he wants to go and what he  needs to have a secure border.  </p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The Republicans are  in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate, a shutdown is on  their back.  Stick to the $1.6 billion.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is Texas  Congressman, House Energy and Commerce Committee member, medical doctor as  well, Michael Burgess.  Sir -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very  much for joining us.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Good  morning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the border wall.  What are your expectations?   You're coming from Texas.  You are a border state.  What are your  expectation in terms of getting that money for the border wall.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, I think it has to be the $5 billion figure that the  President has articulated.  And we saw from the images over the weekend  that people that actually were able to find their way through the fence.   Look, every senator that's over there that was here in 2006 voted for the  Secure Fence Act.  So they apparently believed it in 2006.</p><p>But it's apparent that the fence is not working.  And the President is  correct, the wall is necessary.  People are getting hurt because they feel  that this fence is something they can slide through and achieve their goal.   The wall needs to be there as a matter of public safety.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is it that the Republicans are not firmly behind this  president on this topic.  We know that there are many within your chamber  that actually wince when they hear that the President wants this money.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, I guess we'll see at the end of this week or the end of  next week, just exactly where everyone is.  But I think the President is  correct on this and he is correct to push on this.  And my belief is that  he will achieve what he needs to achieve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And coming from a border state, tell us why you think it's  important.  I mean do you have any anecdotes for us in terms of what you're  seeing in the state of Texas?  </p><p>BURGESS:  My district is not on the border, although I do travel to the  border a lot.  And what I have seen, my experience on the border in both  President Obama's administration and President Trump's administration is  that we really have no border at all and people are able -- the coyotes are  able to deposit groups of people -- 14, 16, 18 people, women, children,  teenagers on the United States side of the border.</p><p>The customs and border patrol then are obligated to take care of those  people.  And guess what, a mile up the river you've got all kinds of  cocaine, fentanyl and heroin coming across the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p>BURGESS:  It is unsustainable the way it is going on right now.  Keep doing  the same thing over and over again, we're going to get worse results.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are willing to shut the government down if the money is  not there for the wall then?  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, it wouldn't be me that shuts the government down.  It would  be senator Schumer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know but if you vote -- </p><p>BURGESS:  It would be Senator Schumer that shuts -- because the votes will  be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just heard what he said though, Congressman.  He just said  the Republicans are in charge of the executive office, the Senate and the  House.  It's on them.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Yes, correct, he is right.  And that is why Mitch McConnell this  time will have to revoke the 60 vote rule for cloture.  And will have to be  a simple majority over at the Senate.  I think it's pretty straightforward.</p><p>Otherwise you end up in a mess which is where we've been for several years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>Let me switch gears to GM.  There's more trouble here.  The President is  threatening to cut subsidies to General Motors after the automaker  announced its plans to cut 14,000 jobs.  It's shutting down five U.S.  factories next year.</p><p>The President is slamming the company and he did so in a tweet yesterday  sending GM stock tumbling to session lows.  It was down 2.5 percent  yesterday.</p><p>National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow reinforced the President's  frustration.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's disappointment that it seems like GM would rather build  its electric cars in China rather than in the United States.  We are going  to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others,  whether they should apply or not.  I can't say anything final about that  but we're looking into it.</p><p>Again, that reflects the President's own disappointment regarding these  actions.</p><p>Ms. Barra told me on the other hand, I want to be completely fair here,  it's her business -- it may be possible to transfer workers to other plants  in Texas and Michigan.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your predictions for the future?  Are you expecting jobs to be  transferred to Texas?  And should the President be brow-beating  corporations?  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, first the good news is that you're correct, the TexasGM  plant was not one of those ones that were targeted for closure.  So folks  in Arlington, Texas won't be faced -- won't be faced with that.</p><p>But look, back in 2008 right at the end of the Bush administration rather,  I was -- I was pilloried for not voting to allow the President to move TARP  money over to the General Motors, to not bail out the automobile companies.   I did not think that was a good idea but it happened.  And it was done.   President Obama then took credit for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BURGESS:  Look, the American people stepped up and gave money to that  corporation to keep it out of bankruptcy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BURGESS:  Many of us argued that a bankruptcy would have actually been a  more straightforward path.  Now they come back and say well, great that you  gave us this money but we'll be building these Bolts in China.  That just  doesn't -- people don't accept that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could understand that.  </p><p>Real quick, sir -- let me get your take on the big news for the Democrats  today.  House Democrats are facing this key vote to select the next speaker  of the house.  Congressman, your expectations for the preliminary vote  today.  Will Nancy Pelosi be the next speaker?  </p><p>BURGESS:  Yes.  And it will be a tragedy for the country.  You remember the  last time she was speaker, the economy cratered and then could not recover  until she was replaced as speaker.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House of Representatives is detrimental to  our economy.  And it will soon become evident to people just what a mistake  they have made in allowing this to happen.  But make no mistake about it,  Democrats will vote for their speaker, that's what they have to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the infamous comments from Nancy Pelosi was her  calling all of the tax cut \"crumbs\", the tax cut money, she called it  crumbs.</p><p>And now the House Republicans have this new tax package and they're facing  more opposition from Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats.  They say they were  blind-sided by the proposal.  The House GOP is unveiling the new round of  tax cuts this week</p><p>You and your colleagues want to pass this during the Congress' lame duck  session.  It would revive expired tax breaks, address glitches in last  year's tax plan, change savings and retirement related provisions.</p><p>Are you going to be able to get this over the finish line?  </p><p>BURGESS:  In the United States House of Representatives, yes.  And then the  door closes when Nancy Pelosi is speaker.  Again, I cannot stress how  difficult it was on the economy when this individual was speaker of the  house before.</p><p>Unfortunately, people do have short memories and they do not recall all of  the things that led up to the crash of 2008.  All were on her watch, all  were on her watch and then the recovery could not get off the -- could not  get off the deck until John Boehner was sworn in as speaker in 2011.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if that's what you're predicting, then I guess have you a  good shot to gain the majority back in two years then -- Congressman.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, I mean it's not about me or the majority, it's about the  country.  And we are entering into a dangerous time, I feel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- we'll be watching.</p><p>BURGESS:  But to answer your question, Democrats will have no choice.  They  have to vote for their speaker.  That is their rule.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>BURGESS:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Michael Burgess there in Washington.</p><p>Coming up, technology takeover -- Google is paying $1 billion for new  offices in the second biggest real estate deal of the year.  Details there.</p><p>Then more money in your pocket, how your old iPhone is gaining value.</p><p>Back in a minute.  Right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New information in Indonesia's Lion Air crash -- investigators now  increasingly focused on a potential maintenance problem.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is  interesting -- Maria.</p><p>Indonesian investigators say that Lion Air mechanics may have made a  mistake that caused the deadly plane crash last month.  A preliminary  report says maintenance workers have failed to repair a sensor on the  Boeing 737 Max.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Maria earlier this month, Boeing's CEO  Dennis Muilenburg said his company is fully cooperating with this  investigation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what happened?  Apparently there were 10 computers -- the  computer, it's about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the  plane went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went  wrong?  </p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO BOEING:  Yes.  As the Indonesian authorities have  all pointed out, initially there was some indications of an inaccurate  angle attack signal that was being sent to the airplane.  And of course, an  airplane has the ability to handle that.  We have procedures in place.</p><p>And we've already issued a couple of additional bulletins to our operators  and pilots around the world that point them back to existing flight  procedures to handle that kind of condition.</p><p>So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation as it  proceeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Well, taking a look at shares of Boeing, up 7 percent  so far this year.</p><p>Apple wants more owners of older iPhones to buy new ones.  The company is  raising the trade-in value of the older phones through its give-back  program.</p><p>So basically, you can get $150 for an iPhone 6, $200 for a 6 plus, that  doubled Apple's old trade-in value for those particular models.  There's a  lot on the list.  You can go take a look on the web.</p><p>Shares of Apple have been hit hard recently by concerns about slowing  iPhone demand.  Maybe this is their answer.</p><p>And then, ok you've heard a dog is man's best friend.  Maybe a dog is  woman's best friend.  A new study finds women sleep better when they share  a bed with a dog rather than another human.  They report that sleeping next  to their pooch is less disruptive.  The dogs give them greater feelings of  comfort and security.</p><p>If case you're wondering, Maria, women who slept with cats did not show the  same benefit because sometimes cats decide let's jump around at midnight  all over the apartment and then maybe dive bomb the bed, just as an  example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because dogs are more cuddly than cats.  WE know that.</p><p>CASONE:  Well.  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm a dog person.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Obviously -- that men are dogs, I guess it makes perfect sense,  right.  So there you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, that's an insult to dogs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do Charlie and Ramon sleep on the bed?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, of course.  Ella Bella always slept on my bed.  And I love  that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Charlie is a great, great pal.  Ramon has a mind of his  own.  Ramon has been sleeping in the living room lately.  I don't know what  I did to make him angry.</p><p>But don't say men are dogs because that's an insult to dogs.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I need to go down to the emergency room, get the blood stopped  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, a new way to watch -- how Audi and Disney plan on  creating content for self-driving cars.  Big story there.</p><p>Then oh, baby, Olivia is the second most popular girl's name this year.   The top names for girls and boys, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the big business of real estate with technology is  spreading to Silicon Valley.  Google is holding the two top spots for the  largest deals of the year in terms of real estate on the East and the West  Coast.</p><p>The technology giant is spending $1 billion for a building in Mountain  View, California and more than $2 billion for a building here in New York  City.</p><p>Joining us right now is Rudin Management co-chairman and CEO Bill Rudin to  talk more about real estate today.  It is good to see you.  </p><p>WILLIAM RUDIN, CO-CHAIRMAN, RUDIN MANAGEMENT:  Good to see you -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>First, characterize what you're seeing in terms of real estate in New York.   What companies are doing much of the buying?  Where you're seeing the  expansion and growth?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, we're heading for a near record year in terms of commercial  leasing, over 30 million feet already year-to-date.  So we've already  surpassed last year's record of 30 million feet.  So we'll probably be  north of 32 million feet of commercial leases done with companies like  Google, Zillow, WeWork, Peloton (ph).</p><p>And then obviously with the Amazon announcement it's an incredible, you  know, signal that New York really is a technology hub.  Our city is  diversifying its economic base with these large technology companies, small  technology companies, but reaffirmed by Amazon committing to Long Island  City.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm so glad you mentioned Amazon because the headquarters 2 --  HQ2 we're calling it -- Amazon has chosen Queens as one of the places.  The  announcement facing backlash though over incentives and nondisclosure  agreements involved in these deals.</p><p>So Amazon's move, were you surprised that they chose New York?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, our project in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, we have submitted  along with the city to try to get them to go to Brooklyn.  But we're very  happy that they've decided to go to Long Island City.</p><p>But I think, you know, some of these issues that are raised --  infrastructure, education, they will be resolved.  The fact that when  they're moving into the first building it's being vacated by Citicorp.  So  there's not going to be an impact in terms of population.</p><p>But as they continue to grow, the city's already committed, you know,  several hundred million dollars for infrastructure.  There's a new ferry  service.  There's education requirements as part of the deal.  </p><p>So we think it's net-net, you know, for the future of the city -- very,  very positive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think -- I mean that has to have legs, in other words.   Because Amazon is building this big project where it is, you say ferry, I  mean in other words, it's going to create a lot more economic activity than  what just meets the eye.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Billions and billions of dollars.  We're building a project right  now at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, not too far -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is Dock 72.  </p><p>RUDIN:  This is Dock 72, just not too far south of Long Island City.  And  we designed it with our partners Boston Properties and our lead tenant. We  work to really be the office building of the future.  It has all the  infrastructure, the technology.  It has the amenities.  It has a food hall.   It has a basketball court.  It has a conference center.  It has a wellness  center.</p><p>These are all amenities that companies like Amazon, Google and everybody in  between want to have so they can attract and retain their employees.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were just looking at it -- 675,000 square foot building  designed to integrate state of the art, modern class A office  infrastructure.  What does something like this -- how does it differ than  some of the typical buildings that you see in New York?  Why is this so  special and different?  </p><p>We work with WeWork, who is one of the preeminent shared office companies  literally in the world, to really curate and design the building to meet  the demands of the tenants of the future.  They want these amenities.  They  want the lobby to be a place where they can gather and talk to each other.   We can operate the building off of our iPhone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In other words -- temperature, lighting, you can do all that  from the phone.  </p><p>RUDIN:  We have a system that we created, our company called an Anthem and  we also have a building app so a tenant can order their food.  They get  delivered from our food hall downstairs.</p><p>They want to see when the next ferry is coming, they go to the app.  They  want to know when the shuttle is coming, they go to the app.</p><p>All of these things are looking to the future in terms of what companies  and their employees want to have this live-work environment and have a  place to enjoy themselves while they're working.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I love the pictures -- 14 feet floor to floor height with  eight feet of vision, unobstructed views of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Really  beautiful stuff.</p><p>RUDIN:  I'm going to have you as our rental agent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the demand and what you're seeing.  Is it  resonating?  I mean I want to ask you about domestic as well as foreigners  because for a long time the appetite for real estate by the Chinese was  very strong.  But apparently Chinese investors for real estate in the U.S.  has declined.  What can you tell us about that?</p><p>The \"South China Morning Post\" says Chinese inquiries dropped 11.4 percent  in September.  </p><p>RUDIN:  There's no question that the Chinese in terms of their appetite to  buy in the United States has waned.  They're selling product.  But we're  seeing other investors.  You see Canadians come in.  You see domestic  buyers come in.</p><p>And I think that just again shows the strength of particularly of New York  and the demand in terms of people wanting to be here and live here and  companies want to find the talent.  That's why Amazon came here.  They're  looking for the talent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So even though China real estate investment is down, it's still  number one.  </p><p>RUDIN:  No question about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Let me ask you your take on what you're seeing in terms of  the broad economy.  I mean real estate is a big portion of that.  So you're  talking about this booming situation right now for real estate and yet  markets are nervous, people are worried that growth is going to slow down  in the coming couple of years.  How do you see it?</p><p>RUDIN:  Well, definitely concerned about interest rates, and where the  interest rate market is going.  We're going to see the GDP come out today.   But we still see strong demand.  Housing -- there seems to be an  oversupply.  That markets have cooled down.  And we look at that as an  opportunity to come in, and as a buying opportunity for people that are  looking for homes, people looking to develop and find land a little bit  cheaper.</p><p>Hopefully this tariff situation gets resolved, so commodity prices will  start coming back down.  So those are big issues.</p><p>But we still see job growth.  And that really for our business drives our  decision in terms of where we want to invest, when we want to invest, and  what type of product we want to invest in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the project now in terms of filling it up?  </p><p>RUDIN:  We are about a third lease with WeWork as the main tenant.  They're  building out their space.  We have very good activity.  We'll be opening  the building early next year.  We have a direct ferry connection that the  city is putting in right at the foot of our building.</p><p>So we've seen very good demand and hopefully sometime next year we'll be  able to talk about some leases and I'll come back to you and tell you, you  know, who's moving into the building.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is an important client, an important tenant, WeWork.   I mean, they are expanding throughout the country.  What's your take on  WeWork getting so much of the capacity?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, we made our first deal with WeWork back in 2012-13, when we  net leased our building at 110 Wall Street to them.  And they did their  first WeWork, WeLive and they've obviously grown.  I think the value then  was $500 million.  Now we're seeing it over $40 billion.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's incredible.  </p><p>RUDIN:  And so, they provided incredible I think niche in the marketplace  for small companies and even large companies to find space on a flexible  basis.  That helps these companies grow and then hopefully they grow and  then they move into our building.</p><p>And at dock 72, we have the flexibility to make a long-term lease with a  tenant and if they want to take additional space on a short-term basis,  we're able to do that at -- with the We Work Space.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks beautiful, Bill.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, you mentioned the GDP.  We're getting the GDP out in an  hour.  We are expecting 3-1/2 percent growth for the -- for the third  quarter.  When we get that number, I see you today at the Jay Powell's  speech?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Am I going to see you at the Jay Powell's speech?</p><p>RUDIN:  I will be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will I and the Fed chairman is going to be speaking at 12:00  noon.  Are you comfortable with what's happening with interest rates, where  the Fed has been raising consistently, we're expecting another hike on  December 18th and then another three hikes next year?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, obviously, interest costs are a big component of our  business.  And we had 10 years of very, very low interest rates and it's  not surprising in our view that rates are starting to go up.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to slow things down a lot, though?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, I think hopefully not too much.  I think they're trying to  balance obviously inflation and the growth issues and employment.  But  we'll have to see what the -- what the chairman has to say in a couple  hours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will be there.  Bill, good to see you.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Bill Rudin, Rudin Management.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us, a lot to come.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning many happy Wednesday everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, November 28th.   Your top stories right now 7:35 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>The president against the Federal Reserve.  President Trump is telling the  Washington Post this morning, he is not at all happy with his choice of Jay  Powell as chief of the Fed.  That is ahead of the Fed chairman's speech  today at 12:00 p.m. at the New York Economic Club.  Fox Business is  covering that speech live.  We will bring it to you live at noon, so keep  it right here to get the chairman's comment.  </p><p>We will also have a second reading on the third quarter GDP in less than an  hour's time, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting the GDP to show growth in  the economy, of 3-1/2 percent.  We will have those numbers for you as soon  as they hit the tape and tell you how it's impacting markets.  </p><p>Right now, ahead of the number, Futures indicating a nice rally at the  start of trading, up 150 points on the Dow Industrials this morning, up 11  points on the S&amp;P and up about 40 points on the NASDAQ, going into the  numbers, we're now at the high of the morning in stocks.  </p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday on Wall Street.  Take a look, DowIndustrials was up 108 points, almost one half of one percent.  The S&amp;P 500  was up eight points and the NASDAQ up a fraction, under one point higher  yesterday at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are mixed.  FT-100 is pulling back, down  about a third of a percent.  But the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 20 points  and the DAX Index in Germany also up 20 points, fractional moves there in  Europe.  </p><p>Asia overnight, take a look, higher across the board, best performer was in  Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Watching in the car, Disney is teaming up with Audi to help you pass the  time when you're in a self-driving car.  Wait until you see what they're  doing, details coming up.</p><p>A deal of pure imagination, Netflix is inking a deal to produce a series  based on the works of Roald Dahl.  </p><p>Plus, move over Lucas and Riley, we've got the most popular baby names for  2018.  We've got the list.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, oversees trouble for American  companies.  Facebook called to the Grand Committee on Disinformation in  Britain yesterday over allegations that's the company knew about Russian  data mining on the site as far back as October 2014.  Facebook's vice  president of policy solutions Richard Allan sat at the hearing next to an  empty chair left for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who did not show.  </p><p>Meanwhile, consumer advocates in Europe are filing complaints against  Google.  They allege the way the search giant tracks users' locations, that  it violates the European Union's data privacy law.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And judge, it is good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning --  good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all this?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, Great Britain, the parliament does not like it when you  don't accept an invitation.  I mean, this empty chair for Mark Zuckerberg  reminds me of political debates.  You've probably been through this  governor, where your adversary didn't show but you show an empty chair sort  of mock your adversaries at absence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it is sort of a poke in the eye, isn't it judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is -- it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you know, they're under pressure, go explain yourself.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Agreed but I guess his people and he's got the best and the  brightest (INAUDIBLE) around him have decided that this wasn't the time or  place when to do it.  Now, this is not a subpoena, he was not legally  compelled to be there.  But as for the essence of what's going on, the  European Union actually has stronger privacy laws than we do here in the  United States.  And some of the data mining gathering and sharing that  Facebook and the Google, for example, engage in probably does transgress  E.U. privacy regulations in a way that would not transgress American  privacy regulations.  That's issue number one that they're very concerned  about over there.  </p><p>The other issue of course is the substance of that hearing at which Mark  Zuckerberg didn't go.  Didn't you know that the Russians were using  Facebook to data mine and why did you permit it to happen and to whom did  you report it?  They actually have e-mails from some Facebook engineers  reporting it to management.  They just looked up the IPS numbers and knew  it was coming from that catering place in St. Petersburg which as we know  from Bob Mueller and others was the source of all the Russian hacking that  occurred in Russia but victimized us over here.  Same location.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see regulation on these technology companies,  do you think?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, I think you're going to see more regulation going  through.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the regulation look like -- what does the regulation  look like?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- I don't know what it looks like.  But I do know  that you don't have a First Amendment to worry about in Great Britain so --  or in the E.U. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So the regulation can be a little bit heavier.  Judges are far  less likely to interfere with it over there on the grounds that it would  impair the free speech rights of the gatherer, in this case Facebook, than  judges would be over here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But don't you think judge, that at some point, we're going to  see that regulation come here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think so.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, the AT&amp;T breakup --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been saying this for two years.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But yes, but I mean, the AT&amp;T breakup of several decades ago was  far less intrusive.  I mean, people could still get a telephone.  Now you  have Facebook and companies like Google and Twitter who are saying you  can't say these things on these platforms.  So it's really come to the  place where they are no longer just social media platforms, they are public  utilities.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know in my (AUDIO GAP) if you don't like (AUDIO GAP) go to  somebody else.  But there's very few somebody else's to which you can go.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Google --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Because the barriers to entry are so extraordinary.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The amount of money is so tremendous that would be needed to  compete.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the government --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but Google has what market share Dagen McDowell?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  90 percent of search.  They control 90 percent of search and  Facebook and Google combined control, what, 60 to 70 percent of all  advertising.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>KELLY:  There's two separate things here that were --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, can I just -- I want to point something out legally.   Because these companies are (INAUDIBLE) -- they are very much to your point  -- if you're going to censor content in the way that Twitter is more and  more, they're a publisher.  But these companies have liability waivers  based on the law right now from user generated content.  You watch those  liability waivers go away.  If they're going to act like a publisher,  you're going to get treated like one.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, McD as usual is ahead of us and is suggesting that if you  publish something on Facebook, Facebook's not liable for it.  And if  Facebook blocks it they're not liable to you for blocking it.  If Facebook  were to become just able to board where anybody could put anything on  there, then there'd have to be some sort of liability.  I don't know where  that's going to go.  </p><p>Quite frankly, Dagen, that is virgin, judicial and legislative territory it  has not been addressed yet in the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you speak --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I am loathe to have the government tell Facebook what to post  on their bulletin board because they're not the government.  They're not  regulated by the First Amendment.  They want to kick me out, they can do  so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking about a different judiciary system, what kind of a  judiciary system puts a guy in jail and then decides what to charge him  with?  That's Carlos Ghosn, the embattled former Nissan Chairman Carlos  Ghosn hired a former prosecutor now to defend him.  Ghosn was arrested and  accused of falsifying financial reports.  </p><p>But judge, he's sitting in a jail right now in Japan, sleeping on a cot,  eating porridge, being told you can't speak to your family, and they didn't  even charge him with anything officially yet.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, I don't want to sound snarky, but he's lucky they  even let him talk to his lawyer.  This is a system where when you're  charged you presumed guilty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's wrong.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's not a system when you're charged, when you're presumed  innocent.  It's not -- it's not a western based system.  There is so little  litigation and so little prosecution in Japan, that they believe -- I might  condemn it myself, but they believe that this is a successful system.  They  charge you, you're presumed guilty.  You have to prove your innocence.  </p><p>Now, he has hired an extremely aggressive prosecutor, the person who  formerly ran the office that's now prosecuting him.  Right, this would be  like getting arrested in New Jersey and hiring Chris Christie to defend  you.  I mean, that's almost literally what he's done in Japan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, judge, this really sounds like it's politically motivated,  that people within Nissan did not want to merge with Renault so they came  up with this stuff -- I mean, maybe there is wrong-doing here.  I don't  know obviously --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the allegate -- the allegations are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but there's no charges so far.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  The suggested allegations are income tax evasion.   The failure --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, $44 million.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The failure -- the failure to account for a large amount of  money in accordance with Japanese law.  But it is a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But he also was merging a French company and a Japanese company  and the Japanese do not want to be owned by a French company.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is reprehensible that the system exists today where you're  guilty until proven innocent but that's Japan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, judge, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you guys.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for getting me riled up.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>Coming up, Disney on the move, how the media giant is teaming up with Audi.  </p><p>Plus Liam, the second most popular boy's name this year.  What will be the  number one boys and girls names?  We will have the list for you, coming up.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Mike.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, Audi and Walt Disney teaming up to offer a  new type of media for self-driving cars.  Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, a big question mark on this one, Maria.  Think about the  future where drivers have -- well, self-driving cars.  What are they going  to do?  Well, Audi and Disney are working on a secret project.  They're  only calling, quote, a new type of media for those cars.  The big reveal is  going to be at the CES Trade Show in January.  But an Audi executive says  the new media will take full advantage of being inside of a vehicle.  They  also hit the tech could be used by back seat passengers in the near term.   What the media is, well, nobody really knows but taking a look at shares of  Disney, up more than four percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Netflix is bringing back Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.  The  streaming company has bought the rights to the stories of Roald Dahl and  they're going to turn them into animated series.  The books include Charlie  and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda.  </p><p>Many of Dahl's work have been turned into movies and Broadway shows but  this is going to be the first time they've become cartoons.  Production is  set to begin next year.  Shares of Netflix are higher in the premarket, up  more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Then there is this, the top baby names for 2018 are pretty trendy, to say  the least.  OK, according to BabyCenter, Sophia is the top choice for  girls.  That's the ninth straight year.  Jackson is the most popular boy  name for six years running.  But these are not the top choices.  Get this,  the name Ramirez has become popular, it's a character name from the hugely  popular video game Fortnite.  </p><p>And then, Kylie Kardashian named her daughter Stormi, that brought that  names popularity up 63 percent.  Apple didn't make the list this year.   Another random weird names I can't think off of the top of my head that  celebrities name their babies, but anyway, there you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like the list.  But Stormi.  </p><p>CASONE:  Stormi.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Are we sure that it's the Kardashians?  Stormi.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are you laughing?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  We had to go there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are you laughing?  I don't even know why I'm laughing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter by the way, insulted my name because they  disagree with my position on illegal immigration in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is insulted my name on Twitter the other day.  And I said, well,  you know what, at least I know what a period is and can spell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, making your dream job a reality, the secrets of  success.  Back in a minute.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Finding your dream job, according to new survey  by MidAmerica Nazarene University, just one quarter of Americans have  achieved this comfort level professionally.  </p><p>Joining us right now is career expert and the host of \"The Ken Coleman  Show\".  Ken Coleman himself is here.  Good to see you, Ken.</p><p>KEN COLEMAN, CAREER EXPERT &amp; HOST, THE KEN COLEMAN SHOW:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We want a deeper dive into the survey that  shows 12 percent of Americans yearn for a c-suite level position.  Tell us  about it.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Well, the bigger issue is that 25 percent, and that really lines  up beautifully with a recent Gallup poll that says nearly 68 percent of  Americans are disengaged at work.  So, you see those two stats coming  together and that's the real problem.  And so, when you see 25 percent of  Americans are in work that they really love, it's kind of sad given that  we're in America. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not enough.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  And that you have the American dream still very much before you.  </p><p>KELLY:  It's pretty fascinating because I think dream jobs, some people are  want to be YouTubers or bloggers or what have you, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or eBay sellers.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right, exactly.  And -- but how realistic is that and how do you  pair those -- the differences between the two, the realistic with sort of  the dream?  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Yes, I really appreciate that question, because dream job for so  many people sometimes is just all over the place.  What we do on \"The Ken  Coleman Show\" every day is help callers realize that they have the answer  for what they were created to do.  I believe were all created with talents,  things we do best and passions, things we love to do.  And the simple  formula to understand who I really am and what meaningful work is, because  that's what people long for, Kevin, is work that matters deeply to them.  </p><p>So when you look at I can use my talent to develop skills and use those to  do work that gives me great meaning.  This is what people are looking for.   And when you step into that role, it will really -- it really will be a  dream job because you go home every day fulfilled, even though you may be  tired.  And here's the best part Kevin, you wake up on Monday morning with  a spring in your step, not trudging to work with agony, which is really  where 68 percent of Americans really are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even when you wake up at 2:00 in the morning, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, again, I love coming to work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me too.  I don't mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is my dream job. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Getting up at 2:00 a.m.  I love it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do too.  And -- but I never sat back and thought I want to be  on T.V.  It's more of like how are you -- don't you talk your audience  through how do you figure out what satisfies you.  What rewards you.  For  me, it's working with somebody brilliant, harder working than anybody I've  ever known.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And supportive and so bright that you have this incredible  conversation.  That conversation is kind of, that's my reward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right back at you.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Here's the thing, we help people identify what is that Mount  Everest, that ultimate dream job.  But then, we take our eyes off of the  pinnacle and start with, where do we have to start?  You know, I liken it  to a mountain climb.  You know, you've got to train for that, you got to  prepare for that mentally, physically.  And there are stages on the climb.   Life's going to throw --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But still, becoming a business owner was the top spot in this  survey by a wide margin.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  Sure, because that's the entrepreneurial dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because people love what they -- they're doing what they love.  </p><p>COLEMAN:  That's exactly right.  They say, you know what, this is a problem  that I see and I want to solve it.  That's what entrepreneurism is.  It's  that's a problem, I think there ought to be a solution and there's a  connection for me.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And Ken, you know, not always about money.  There are a lot of  people I see that love what they do, they do jobs many of us would not  enjoy at all.  They don't get paid that well but they love what they do  because they love life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to take money out of the equation. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I always say that, take money out of the equation.  Got to love  what you do.  Ken, great insights from you.  Thank you.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Thank you, appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Coleman joining us there.  </p><p>Still ahead, President Trump doubles down, why he's threatening to cut G.M.  subsidies, that's next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Good  Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November 28th.  Your top stories right now  8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.  </p><p>President Trump fighting the Fed.  The President lashing out at Fed  Chairman Jay Powell again.  It comes ahead of a highly anticipated speech  later today from Jay Powell at the New York economic club.  Fox Business  will have full coverage of his comments that begin at 12:00 noon.  Stay  with Fox Business to hear what the Chairman says about the economy and  interest rates now.</p><p>A new threat for General Motors meanwhile.  The administration may  retaliate against the automaker for announcing thousands of job cuts. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's disappointment that it seems like G.M. would  rather build its electric cars in China rather than United States.  There's  a lot of disappointment even anger.  I've heard it again from Mr. Trudeau,  from President Trump, from Democrats and Republicans. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are taking a look at the fallout on that this morning.   Meanwhile, investors are showing signs of optimism this morning.  Futures  indicating a rally at the start of trading up 150 points on the Dow  Industrials, two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P up 11 points, almost a half of  a percent and the NASDAQ 36 points higher.  A half of a percent higher  there as well.</p><p>In less than 30 minutes time, we will get the second reading on the third  quarter GDP.  The expect -- expectations call for growth in the GDP of 3- 1/2 percent for the third quarter.  We will see how that impacts market  after gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are  now back in positive territory for the year after 108-point rally on the  Dow at the close yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, not as strong.  Take a look at the indices here,  the FT-100 is down six points.  Fractional move there.  The CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 13 and the DAX Index in Germany is up six right now.  In Asia  overnight, gains across the board with the best performer being in Hong  Kong up 1-1/3 percent overnight.  The future of jobs in America, we are  taking a look at how Artificial Intelligence will transform the workplace  and how you do your job this morning.  We'll tell you about it.</p><p>Then, one of these things is not like the other.  Look at this!  This huge  cow is going viral this morning.  Look how enormous that car is.  We're  going to tell you why coming up and where that is.  All those stories  coming up this Wednesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly,  and former Arkansas Governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike  Huckabee.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks.  Good to be with all of you. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Futures are pointing up and  we've seen earnings come out, do spectacularly well that's helped make it  go up this morning.  We had sales force yesterday afternoon.  So, there are  technology bellwether in the cloud.  And then you also had Tiffany's today  where actually they met -- they missed on revenue but they actually met on  earnings and they're operating margins stable.</p><p>And that after they've been reinvesting in their business and you're seeing  that time and time again from companies where they're talking about  reinvesting their business and it didn't compromise margins.  So that's  pretty telling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you see in the salesforce.com numbers?  The cloud  obviously very important growth story for the economy.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Billings' growth actually was up 27 percent which everyone  was focused on and it seems like a company that can perennially grow at 20  percent.  And so that's really the focus because they've been such a leader  in the cloud for years and years and years and had high P.E.s, now that  starting to come down, they're getting free-cash-flow growth.  So you saw  it up -- it's up about 8-1/2 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  9-1/4 percent right now. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  There we go.  Yes.  Even more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Salesforce is going to be a real factor today.  And on Tiffany,  we've been having this debate about consumer for the last couple of weeks.   Did you see any cracks in the consumer and the Tiffany report?</p><p>KELLY:  No.  So actually the Tiffany report, they actually said the younger  shopper here in the United States actually helps support their sales here  in the North American market which is pretty telling.  They thought there  was going to be a slowdown in the Chinese market because they actually had  to cut costs.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they missed the same-store sales and the stock is down 10  percent.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So same-store sales has been that the one metric that is really  impact these stocks.  That's what happened last week.  I forgot what  retailer it was but it was the same store sales that sent the stock  reeling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Earlier they reported we're on the 630 hours.  So we've been  watching this.  So management is probably talking right now and it's -- and  more numbers are coming out.  So it's not good on the same-store sales.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will keep watching retail certainly as a big  component of the economy.  President Trump meanwhile is blasting General  Motors after the company's decision to close a manufacturing plant in the  United States and lay off thousands of workers, Edward Lawrence is at the  White House with more on that right now.  Edward, good morning to you.  </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.   Anger would be an understatement for the President and west wing here at  the White House now job cuts and the announcement of closing five plants,  four in the U.S., one in Canada sparked harsher criticism from two world  leaders.  President Trump tweeting out yesterday \"the U.S. saved General  Motors and this is the thanks we get.</p><p>We are now looking at cutting all of G.M. subsidies including for electric  cars.  Now we spoke on the phone with Canadian Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau who echoed the same disappointment.  The Canadian Prime Minister  tweeting out, we'll be supporting Canadian autoworkers and families  affected by G.M.'s plan to close its plants.  The White House Economic  Adviser Larry Kudlow spoke with the G.M. CEO and told her that she needs to  reconsider. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  There is disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than in the United States.  We are going to be looking at certain  subsidies regarding electric cars and others whether they should apply or  not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And politically this looks bad for President Trump who touted  manufacturing jobs coming back to the United States.  Economically, G.M.  says they have to make this move for the survival of the company.  G.M.  goes on to say that what happens to the plant in the U.S. will be a product  or a decision that will come out of auto union worker talks that will  happen next year.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Edward.  Thank you so much.  Edward Lawrence at the  White House.  We are certainly seeing a lot of conversation about that this  morning with regard to G.M.  Thank you, Edward.  Meanwhile, A.I. in the  workplace with Artificial Intelligence technology becoming more common, IBM  is now launching a new business with MIT to help companies adapt in a new  age of  A.I.</p><p>IBM says 120 million employees will have to be retrained by 2021 in order  to adapt to A.I.  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is IBM's  chief talent officer, Diane Gerson.  Diane, it's good to see you.  Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>DIANE GHERSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, IBM:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before I get to the training and all of that, you are the chief  officer.  Tell us what the right skills are today for employees to thrive  in this new era of Artificial Intelligence.  </p><p>GHERSON:  Well, look, it's a whole range.  Obviously, there is cyber  security skills, there's the data science skills, there's front-end and  full stock developer skills.  These are the hottest skills out there in the  market right now.  You're finding a shortage and every company is going to  have to start developing these skills because they just don't exist in  enough -- in enough numbers.</p><p>Every company is being turned into an Artificial Intelligence company of  some kind, a software company of some kind.  And whether it's a bank,  whether it's an industrial company as, you know, everyone is in there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even retail.</p><p>GHERSON:  Right, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, if you're not putting A.I. in your business, then  you're going to get left behind.  </p><p>GHERSON:  That's right.  And there is a shortage of the folks about with  the skills today.  So, the real challenge at every company is facing is,  all right.  How do I develop those skills internally and how do I create a  culture where everybody feels like it's my job to keep continuously  learning, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really fascinating.  </p><p>GHERSON:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how is A.I. changing what we do?  Give us some of the  examples of what A.I. does and how it changes the workplace.</p><p>GHERSON:  Yes.  I'll give you an example.  All of us apply for jobs, right?   And in the old days, if the company was looking for a job that would do  what was normally called a search and print, right?  You know, sort of you  put out some ads and you pray that the right people apply.  Now, the game  is so much more we understand who is out there because we've got all the  data.  And we go to people and we say, would you be interested?</p><p>Not only that but they can come in and take a look and they can say here is  my resume.  Find me a job that matches what I do.  And it might be in a  completely different field.  You might not even know that field exists but  because Artificial Intelligence understands enough about jobs and resumes  and if you have that experience and you must have the skills, it's able to  match you to jobs you never even dreamt of.</p><p>So that's something that we actually have on our Web site here in IBM and  it actually encourage more people than in any other companies to apply for  jobs because it's got that stickiness.  It's like OK, I could do that job.   I never dreamt of it, it says I have an 80 percent match when I apply.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  I like that.  Well, you know, you could imagine how A.I.  and machine learning, in general, scares people.  You know, we see these  robots who do things better than humans do and in all sorts of jobs,  robotics taking over.  I mean General Motors, recently announcing that it's  cutting 15 percent of its workforce.  Is A.I. to blame for that? </p><p>GHERSON:  Well, I think to a large extent it's because our employees in so  many companies haven't reskilled themselves to the future, right?  And it's  so important something that we do is we actually advertise to all our  employees, here are the skills that are declining that we will have a less  10 percent or more decline in demand for.  And here are the ones that are  growing.  And we encourage people to go and take those courses, take those  skills.</p><p>Get the training, move to new opportunities.  That's how companies have to  operate now.  You can't just go into a job and think, well, I got my  college degree, you know, I'm in jobs for like, that doesn't work you  anymore.  So that's I think a really important part of it.  And then the  other one is to be able to match people to openings to be able to say your  job is going away but this other job over here has a good match.</p><p>If you take these extra courses or this extra training and that's something  that Artificial Intelligence can help companies do.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, really important points that you make.  So you are  launching -- the company is launching IBM talent and transformation.  A new  A.I. fuel talent business to help build its modern workforce.  Tells us  about this and what this is MIT partnership.  </p><p>GHERSON:  Well, you know, it's a lot of -- lot of pieces to it.  We've been  at this -- as I said, you know, for four -- five years now, transforming  the skills-based of our company to match the new businesses that we are in.   Our portfolio has changed 50 percent.  So many other companies going  through this now and many of our clients have come to us and said, we like  what you're doing, could we do it too?</p><p>So this announcement of the talent and transformation business is really a  way of saying to clients we're in business with you, to help you do this  too.  And A.I. academy is one of those things.  So it's to help -- to help  train our clients, people, to learn the A.I. skills as they need for the  future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GHERSON:  In IBM, 2,000 people have taken it, they signed up, you know,  overnight, they wanted it so badly.  And it helped people in a variety of  different areas get prepared for A.I. in their field.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the coursework involved at this A.I. University?</p><p>GHERSON:  Yes.  It's got -- it's -- there is a variety as you might  imagine, there's a fair amount of coding, there's a fair amount of  understanding algorithms.  It looks at different applications of A.I. and  it's got a lot of tests.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can an older person in the workforce who has been on assembly  line learn this stuff now?</p><p>GHERSON:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And that's one of the most exciting  things about it, right? Is that it's not just for younger people, in fact,  what we found is our older employees have consumed more learning than our  younger employees because they know they need it.  The half-life of skills  is shrinking.  So their skills are less relevant than someone who just  walked out of school yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know we looked at the risks.  Do you see dangers risks for  A.I.?  And I know that it's hard to say, well, yeah, there are risks but  we're not going to change this because this where is the world is goings  but there are dangers, aren't there? </p><p>GHERSON:  You know, our experience is that it makes more meaningful jobs at  the end.  I'll give you an example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's critical is what you're saying.  </p><p>GHERSON:  In payroll, you know, we have people who are basically copying  one database to another database, submitting it to a vendor.  You know,  that kind of work.  That's all now done by automation.  But the people who  used to do that work are now doing higher level work.  They're -- we call  them job bands.  So job bands are higher.  They're the same people.  They  understand the work but they're not doing the more rote work that  automation is doing for them now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a great analogy.  Very quickly before you go.  How would  you characterize the jobs market right now?  What's your sense of the  economy?  You see a plot of applicants.  </p><p>GHERSON:  I think the market has shifted in the last six months.  And I  find it pretty amazing, it's very much a talent market.  It is not an  employer's market.  Talent has the power.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because there are more job opportunities and if you've got the  skill set you'll get a lot of offers.  </p><p>GHERSON:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great stuff.  Diane, great to have you on the program.</p><p>GHERSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>GHERSON:  Bye-bye.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Diane Gherson from IBM this morning.  Coming up.  Pressuring  Powell.  President Trump taking aim at his Federal Reserve chairman again.   We're taking a closer look at that and have full coverage and analysis of  the GDP report that's coming out in about 15 minutes from now.  Plus, odd  one out.  The story of this huge cow that's going viral, straight ahead.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, tension on Capitol Hill today.  Senators, getting  a briefing on Saudi Arabia.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines  now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The briefing is  going to be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary  James Mattis.  Lawmakers want more information on the administration's  relationship with the Kingdom amid its involvement in the war in Yemen and  the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>CIA Director Gina Haspel not attending the meeting, despite several  Senators saying her agency has intelligence at the Saudi crown prince,  ordered Khashoggi's killing.</p><p>Pompeo, recently wrote on Wall Street Journal op-ed stressing the  importance of America's relationship with that country, here is what he  wrote.  \"Saudi Arabia has also contributed millions of dollars to the U.S.- led effort to fight Islamic State and other terrorist organizations.  Saudi  oil production and economic about stability are keys to regional prosperity  and global energy security.\"</p><p>Well, Mississippi has decided.  Cindy Hyde-Smith has become the states'  first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate.  She defeated Democrat Mike  Espy in the runoff.</p><p>That comes, of course, after President Trump held two rallies in the  Magnolia State ahead of that vote.  President Trump tweeted about it.  Say,  \"Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big win great in the  great State of Mississippi.  We are very proud of you.  With her win, the  GOP has now expanded its Senate majority to 53 seats, versus the Democrats'  47.</p><p>And finally, all we can say about this next story is, holy cow.  You got to  look at this.  This is just the thing's huge.  Six foot four Australian cow  is named Knickers.  The videos gone viral.  Knickers weighs more than 3,000  pounds.  This makes him heavier than some cars, taller than some NBA  players.</p><p>You will not find Knickers on your plate, just to be clear here.  He's too  big to process, says the owner.  So, he's going to live happily ever after  on that farm in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>CASONE:  He's seven now.  He's kind of wild, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did he get that big?</p><p>CASONE:  They don't know.  That's the crazy thing.  They just said that the  cow just kept growing, they can't explain it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  How does he move?  She move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good, that is good.</p><p>KELLY:  I will beef up the jokes later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we got a few -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You got -- you, hey, you got a little more than 40 minutes to go  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the GDP coming up.  Meanwhile, Tiffany shares are  down.  They missed quarterly revenue estimates as we reported earlier, the  same store sales were an issue.  The stock down nine percent.</p><p>Salesforce.com is up big as Kevin told us earlier.  We've got that on the  other side of this break.  Then, science sparking outrage.  The details  after a researcher claims he helped make the first genetically edited  babies.  Big controversy here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a real controversial story here.  A  Chinese researcher is sparking outrage after he claimed that he helped make  the first genetically edited babies.  The researcher also revealing this  morning that a second pregnancy may now be underway.</p><p>This type of gene editing is banned in America and as the Associated Press  has noted, \"There is no independent confirmation of the researcher's claim,  and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by  other experts.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski,  better known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike, good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, CELEBRITY DOCTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really an interesting story.  But it's a technology  that allow scientists to alter the DNA of living cells.  And this guy did  it in an embryo.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  Maria, this is a story straight out of a sci-fi novel.   Because literally, what we're doing here is we're deciding what the future  generation is going to look like when we do gene editing.</p><p>There is incredible moral and ethical concerns when it comes to this, and  this is why the National Academy of Sciences had tremendous international  consensus when they said, \"If you're going to be doing human trials, you  have to be open about it, you have to go under ethics review, you have to  tell people what you're doing, and it has to be in a life-or-death case.</p><p>You have diseases like Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis that kill  people.  So, if you're going to be doing trials, do it on that.  This  gentleman did his trial in secret.  His hospital wasn't aware of it, the  university wasn't aware of it.  He was doing this in total secrecy, and  then he did it to prevent or, at least, hope to prevent an infection -- a  future infection with HIV.  This is not life or death, because we have  treatments for HIV.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  HIV is no longer a killer disease.  It's a -- it's a chronic  illness that we can control with medications.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said he altered a gene in embryos for seven couples during  their fertility treatments.</p><p>KELLY:  Can we trust that he was actually able to do this?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  I mean, it hasn't been independently reviewed, just how the  Associated Press said.  But it sounds like it's true, there was also a  doctor from the United States, a scientist that was working with him on  this that claim that this happened.  But there has been huge outrage in the  scientific community and rightfully so, because this is unprecedented.</p><p>Gene editing is going to be the problem of my generation.  A lot of people  are worried about immigration, economics.  But gene editing is the stuff of  nightmares.  I mean, you can literally create biological warfare with this,  you can create diseases that are not affected by our current treatments.   You can create soldiers with this that can be stronger the -- </p><p>I mean, there are opportunities here, endless and very scary to me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under the umbrella as if you are actually helping the trial of  helping -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  And in secrecy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we don't know how the person will grow up.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's get to something lighter here.  Hold the  cream, pass the butter.  The latest coffee craze involves adding butter and  oil to your morning cup of joe as part of a popular keto diet.  Dr. Mike,  tell us about this.</p><p>Dieters are claiming this helps satisfy their hunger like a meal.  I don't  really think I want butter in my coffee.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well a lot of people claim that it makes them feel fuller, and  it probably does.  Because having a drink that has a high amount of fats,  they're using what we call MCT oil.  It does satiate your hunger hormones,  that is true.</p><p>Now, this keto diet, it's been a huge trend last year, this year, and it's  probably going to continue.  Because what we're finding is that diets that  are very low carb actually outperform low-fat diets.  And that's the big  story here because we grew up 20 years ago, 30 years ago talking about how  fat is bad and that's the danger to creating heart disease and all of that.</p><p>And what we're finding it's actually simple refined carbohydrates, sugars,  white breads, white pastas, white rice, eating those in large amounts is  actually what's going to courage you to gain weight, be unhealthier, and  increase the risks of diabetes.</p><p>KELLY:  I like it.  I do it, my wife does it.  Everyone should try it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have butter when you coffee?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, three times a week, at least.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're an animal.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, no, there are dangers of it.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  Do it.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  There are some dangers with it.</p><p>KELLY:  I look dangerously.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  You're like the new James Bond.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to my case.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  We'll be right back with the GDP, right  after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are about to get the GDP number out.  We are  expecting 3-1/2 percent growth for the GDP.  This would be the second  reading -- 3.5 percent is the number, right in line with estimates.  Let's  see if there's a market reaction.  We got a 3-1/2 percent growth number for  the second reading for the third quarter, and this was what we were  expecting, so it is a good number, certainly 3-1/2 percent showing growth.   We're going to dig deeper into the number and show you what it says about  consumer spending.  And as we bring in right now former Chief Economic  Advisor under George W. Bush, Ed Lazear to talk more about this.  And Ed,  it is good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ED LAZEAR, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH:  Nice to be  with you, Maria, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  3-1/2 percent growth for the GDP follows the second quarter  which was 4.2 percent economic growth.  In the second quarter now, the  third quarter 3-1/2 percent.  Your reaction.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, obviously, that's good news, this is a considerable step up  from where we were during the rest of the recovery, as you know we were  down around two percent.  So, this is a qualitatively quite different from  where we were.  Now, the question, of course, is what does this signify  about the future?  I think everybody always wants to know what the current  numbers mean for where we're going, the current numbers of the past or  obviously what we're most much more interested in is where the economy is  headed.  I would say a couple of things on this.  You just mentioned  consumption is good.  That was strong in these numbers.  Investment has not  been quite as strong in these numbers and that's a concern.  Housing,  autos, obviously are the weak spot in the economy right now.  So, if I were  going to point to something, I'd say that would be the major concern.  </p><p>But going forward, I always like to use the market as an indicator.  My  view is that the best forecast of the future is essentially what the market  is telling us, so I always base my forecast on changes in the S&amp;P 500,  which as we know has not been great over the past few months.  And so, if  you look at that, the market is essentially telling us, that the next four  quarters, we would expect something like two percent growth as opposed to  three percent growth.  Hopefully, the market got it wrong, and we'll be  able to revise that, but right now, that's where we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending was revised lower in this report and the  market is weakening here, any reduction to what the market is telling us on  this news?  Is this basically saying the Fed keeps up the rate hikes?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, two things, one is you don't want to look at, you know,  short-run movements in the market.  I mean, you know, certainly minute to  minute but even day to day, tend not to be the kinds of things that I rely  on.  I tend to look at something like three months or six months.  In terms  of the Fed, you know, the Fed is in kind of a difficult situation right  now, because they probably would rather have had rates high already and  have been at a place where they'd like to be, so they had some flexibility.   But they're -- you know, this is kind of the situation where you decide  you're an hour late for the ball, and the question is should you drive  twice the speed limit to get there?  And I don't think that's a very good  strategy for them, and I think, the chairman probably knows that.  So, in  terms of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And we're -- and we're going to hear from the chairman  today that the Fed chairman is going to speak at 12:00 noon, Dagen, and we  know that we are waiting for any expectations of what he says on inflation  and this growth number.  Your reaction? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- I was just looking into the number.  So you -- consumer  spending, it came in in the initial reading, it was running at a four  percent rate, and in this report, it came in at --</p><p>KELLY:  3.6.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- 3.6 percent.  Thank you.  I was looking through the --  through the write through on this.  But in terms of interest rates, The  Wall Street Journal, this morning, highlights the predicament that all  investors will be in with the Federal Reserve.  And how these speeches from  the likes of Jay Powell matter even more because we're going into the New  Year, fully expected that the Fed does hike at its December 18th, 19th  meeting.  But looking into 2019, there's a real split, do they raise two  times, three times, four times?  That is the outlook, it's really wide- open, so it creates the potential for more volatility in the stock market.   And not just stocks, but also the bond market and across all of the asset  classes that have sold off so sharply this year.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ed, this is Mike Huckabee.  What do you think is the key factor  that has driven the GDP to rise starkly since the last election?  I mean, I  think that's maybe a burning question, and if it's something tangible that  was done, why don't we keep doing it?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, that's a good question, and I think it's the obvious two  things that people always talk about, one is taxes and one is the new  regulatory regime.  So, if we're thinking about how this administration  views markets and business in general as compared with the last  administration, it's quite a different story.  So, if I'm an investor, if  I'm a businessperson, trying to figure out what to do in the future, and  I'm looking at the situation today, versus a situation three years ago,  this is a much more positive situation.  Now, you said, you know, what --  if this worked in the past, what can we continue to do?  </p><p>Obviously, we know there's a movement right now to try to do a bit more on  the tax front.  You know, that's going to be pretty tough sledding, I  think, in a lame-duck Congress.  But obviously, if it were to get done that  would have some effect.  Most of the action would come about through the  saving and investment vehicles, because that's really where the growth --  the growth lies.  It's the other stuff may be important, may be useful, but  in terms of affecting economic growth, it's primarily saving an investment  that does it.  If we don't have much action on that front, we're not going  to have much growth from the tax legislation even if it were to pass.</p><p>KELLY:  Ed, it's Kevin Kelley.  As we hit home about the household spending  grew 3.6 percent but it was down from four percent, and that was because of  lower durable-goods orders.  And we're talking about spending an investment  that you -- in order for our GDP to keep going at this.  Where do you see  first quarter GDP, and GDP going next year?  Because I can't drive looking  through the rear-view mirror.  So, we've had a great couple quarters but  everyone is worried that sugar high from the tax cuts are going to come  down.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Yes, I guess.  I don't see the tax cuts as so much of a sugar  high, people talk about it as a stimulus.  I don't think of it as a  stimulus.  I actually thought of the tax bill as moving to a more efficient  way of collecting the revenues that the government needs.  We -- virtually  all economists agree that the most pernicious tax in terms of economic  growth, is tax on capital.  So, the reduction in taxes on capital were a  positive factor in terms of long-term economic growth.  It's not just the  sugar high as you mentioned.  So, I would think that that would continue to  be a positive force.</p><p>Again, going for the, you know, the next quarter, the next four quarters,  obviously, the market is seeing something that it doesn't like today as  much as it liked a few months back.  And so, that's an important caution,  and I think the -- you know, the fact that consumption is a little lower  than it was is not quite as troubling to me, but the softness in the  housing market that we've seen over the past few months, I think is a  concern, and it's something that we need to keep watching.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's Dagen McDowell.  Why haven't the corporate tax cuts  resulted in faster business investment and business spending?  Looking at  this -- the second report on third quarter GDP.  So, the consumer spending  came in a little bit lower.  Business spending was a little bit higher,  among a couple of elements.  Business spending on equipment increased at 3- 1/2 percent rate, that's ahead of the -- </p><p>LAZEAR:  You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- four-tenths of one percent increase previously reported, but  that's still the slowest pace in two years.  So, why aren't businesses  stepping up?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, I would say it's a couple things.  First of all, there's a  change in the nature of investment in the last quarter.  As you know, if  you look at -- you mentioned durables and some of the other factors,  equipment, structures, have not been great, but on the -- on the  intellectual property front, technology, that's been pretty good.  So, that  was an offset there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important topic.  This is a really important  point that you're making.  This is also what I got from a leading figure in  the corporate world recently when I asked the same exact question that you  just did.  And he said that when you invest in things like technology, and  A.I., which those investments are soaring, that becomes a write-off, that  doesn't go in the category of business spending.  </p><p>So, while it looks like businesses have stopped or slowed down their  spending quite substantially, they may not be spending on the assembly line  but they're spending on technology which often becomes a write-off on the  balance sheet.  And so, it doesn't go into the category of spending, but  that spending is up big.  So, that's what you just said, and I was happy  you said that because that confirms what I had been hearing as well.   Sorry, continue, please.</p><p>LAZEAR:  That's right.  And the good news on that, of course, is spending  on technology has positive long run effects for us.  So, if you're talking  about future growth and you're thinking, you know, what are -- what are the  two most important things that affect the future?  It's primarily  technology and human capital.  So, investment in people and investment in  machines and new technology.  That's the way you make the economy grow.</p><p>So, hopefully, we'll see that pan out over the next few years.  Sometimes  these things have very long legs.  I don't know if you remember, Maria, but  there was a period when everybody was waiting for the I.T. -- all the I.T.  investments and all the innovation in I.T. to translate into manufacturing,  all kinds of increases, and it took a long time for that to happen.   Actually, it didn't happen until the late 90s.  So, sometimes these things  are slower than we would like, but the fact that we're doing that at least  is a good sign, not only from the accounting point of view that you -- that  you mentioned, which I think is an extremely important point, but beyond  that, just in terms of the structure as we go forward. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But to Dagen's point, do you think the investment in things  like, you know, assembly line, in deals, in other areas will come back?   Or, should we be looking at business investment in a different way?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, I -- you know, the -- I would say the second factor there,  of course, is the real interest rate, and we know that real interest rates  are rising.  And that tends to dampen investment, incentives a bit.  I  think, you know, as the Governor had mentioned earlier, the overwhelming  factor is going forward are the ones that really relate to taxes, to  regulation, to the whole administration's outlook on business in general.   And so, I would think that would be the more fundamental force, but you  know, we've had a -- hopefully, a blip in this quarter, and we'll see it  come back later on.  Again, to me, the most --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you mentioned rates -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>LAZEAR:  I'm sorry, go ahead, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, finish your thought.  Go ahead.</p><p>LAZEAR:  No, I was going to say, to me, the most -- the most concerning  issue is why the market is not -- is not seeing that, not reacting more  positively than it has been.  And my guess is that has a bit to do with the  slowdown in the global economy, and also, some of the sectors that you're  talking about here, particularly housing and autos.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you mentioned rates, Ed.  What's your take on President  Trump slamming Fed Chief Jay Powell?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did in an interview again yesterday with The Washington  Post.  He is blaming him for the recent stock market declines, he's even  blaming him for the layoffs at General Motors.  Here's the quote:  \"So far,  I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay.  And I'm not  blaming anybody, but I'm just telling you, I think that the Fed is way off- base with what they are doing.\"  Are they off-base?</p><p>LAZEAR:  Well, you know, the President's rarely reticent to criticize  people with whom he doesn't agree, and I don't know that Powell should be  any different.  I guess, I think -- yes, I think he is way off.  I think  that Powell has been doing a pretty good job, he's following a path that's  a stable and consistent path, it's careful.  It is getting to us the kinds  of rates that we really need for the long run.  So, I don't think there's  anything wrong with that, obviously Presidents always want to see lower  interest rates, particularly a President like President Trump who has a  background in investment and real estate and so forth, and likes low  interest rates.  So, it's not a surprise to me that the President would  like to see lower interest rates, but it's also not a surprise to me that  the chairman is acting independently and following his best judgment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just be careful what you wish for, Ed, because if you get lower  interest rates that's the market, if you're talking about longer-term  interest rates, that's the market telling you that the economy is headed  into the tank.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Yes.  Well, that's -- you know, that's right, I mean, the big  thing, of course, you always worry about is yield curve slope and  inversions, and so forth, and you flow, we saw that in spades when I was in  the government back, you know, during financial crisis. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LAZEAR:  And that is a concern, but, again, I don't see that as the major  issue right now, I think the major issue going forward, is do we continue  to have a pro-market kind of environment.  I wouldn't say pro-business, I'd  actually say pro-market.  This doesn't mean that you want to pump up  businesses, you want to make sure that the market is able to function.  You  know, everybody has been -- I'm sorry, go ahead, please. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, we're going to go.  But, Ed, just to be clear, you're  not expecting a big slowdown then in the next two years?  Very quickly, we  got to jump, Ed.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Right, I don't see a big slowdown.  I mean, it may slow some, but  I don't see a big slowdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Ed.  We'll see you soon, Sir.  Ed Lazear.  Stay with  Fox Business.</p><p>LAZEAR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Live coverage of Fed Chairman Jay Powell 12:00 p.m. today.   Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump is tweeting this morning on the  Mueller probe.  Here's what the President just wrote:  \"While the  disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report  it that way, at least three major players are intimating that the angry  Mueller gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts and  they will get relief.  This is our Joseph McCarthy era!\"  Wow, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there's an argument made for what's going on with the Paul  Manfort, the rejection of the plea deal that's happening is that this is  his way of signaling -- there are a lot of reports out, I'm not going to go  into great detail about them.  He's way of signaling that the Mueller team  has tried to put pressure on him, and to set him up for potential pardon  down the road.  This is something that Andy McCarthy has -- was writing  about yesterday, I'll say that.  But if Mueller -- if Mueller pursues or  pushes for state charges against Paul Manafort, not at the federal level,  but at the state level, the President doesn't have any pardon power over  Paul Manafort in those instances.  So, there's a -- there are a lot of  moving pieces to this going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And my take on this is it's time, it's time for the  American people to know what Robert Mueller is working on.  It's time.   It's been two years, let's see what you've got.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Let's not forget the whole thing was about did Donald Trump  collude with the Russians to interfere with the election?  And if there's  no evidence of that, then the fact that Paul Manafort did some really  squirrely things when he was in private business, before he was ever  associated with Donald Trump, let us know that, so that we can quit blaming  the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- for something that had nothing to do with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, the notable guilty pleas so far in the Mueller  investigation, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn, those  are process crimes, those are lying to investigators, those are not crimes  related to Russia collusion.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But the media just fails to, you know, separate this,  and be -- and have honesty about it because there's been no evidence of any  collusion.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we got good news today.  The revised GDP number for the third  quarter up 3-1/2 percent in line with estimates.  The host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighing in in now.  And Stu, we were expecting a  good number, we got it.  You don't love the number.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't -- I'm not in love  with a 3.5 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want more.  You want more.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do, I do.  Well, look at this, in the second quarter, four  percent growth.  Third quarter, three percent growth.  Fourth quarter,  we're looking at 2 percent growth.  I don't like a down trend, I want a  solid up trend.  That's what I want to see, and I don't think we are going  to see that.  And by the way, if I can just say this, you're dead right on  Mueller, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY:  What do you got?  Show it, two years?  Put it on the damn table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Come on.  Come on.</p><p>VARNEY:  Excuse me.  Put it on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's enough.  Enough with the speculating.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Alan Dershowitz said yesterday, he thinks that the Mueller  report comes out before the Democrats take the House -- takeover the House  in January.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if we get it by year-end.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's his speculation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what does it say?  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  We  know you've got a lot in the show.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart  and his fantastic panel.</p><p>But first, we are driving into the future, next.  We're checking out the  coolest cars at the L.A. Auto --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Driving into the future, Jeff Flock live at the  Los Angeles Auto Show, checking out the coolest cars this year.  Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Although, I tell you, the  cars may take a backseat to the news.  I'm at the G.M. exhibit, Chevy, GMC  that sort of thing.  You know, it was weeks ago that G.M. told us, and we  were puzzled why there weren't any executives going to be at the L.A. show.   And we're not so puzzled anymore.  Take a look at the Presidential tweets.   I need to get my glasses out to read them.  \"Very disappointed with General  Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan, and  Maryland.  Nothing being closed in Mexico and China.  U.S. saved General  Motors, and this is the thanks we get?  We're looking at cutting G.M.  subsidies including for electricity cars.  G.M. made a big bet in China  years ago when they built plants there, and in Mexico, don't think that bet  is going to pay off.  I'm here to protect American workers!\"</p><p>Well, you know, we'll see.  That's the buzz of the show, though.  Other  buzz, look at the Beetle.  That is the last edition of the Beetle, do you  believe it?  Well, I don't know if you can believe it.  They say it is.   But if you spin around -- spin over here, you remember, there was a last  edition of the Beetle before, that's the real old Beetle.  </p><p>By the way, I'll leave you with this, Maria.  That over there, the blue and  white, that is an electric cargo van that the V.W. is also now going to  sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  All right, Jeff, thank you so much.  Some cool -- some  cool wheels there, Jeff Flock.  Forget --</p><p>Coming up, forget hot chocolate, details on the new winter drink from  Starbucks that tastes like juniper and sage.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, we're expecting a big open on the upside.   But look at Tiffany shares, down 12-1/4 percent right now on the same-store  sales weakness, and the earnings news we told you about earlier.  Gerri  Willis on the floor of the New York Stocks Exchange with more.  Gerri, good  morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right, Tiffany is down as much as 13 percent premarket, after the company  registered lower-than-expected earningsm, $0.77 a share versus $0.78.   Profits down on higher-than-expected investment spending on stores and also  a charged they didn't expect to take for the bankruptcy of a precious  metals refinery.  So, those shares down.  Same-store sales also not  terrific.</p><p>Meanwhile, Burlington, let's talk about that company, it's the opposite  side of the equation.  That stock up dramatically this morning, seven  percent on higher-than-expected earnings.  The discount store chain doing  very well indeed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the big story that everybody is paying attention to today,  Starbucks with their juniper sage latte.  I have it right here in my hot  little hands, tried it, I've got to tell you, not loving it.  It's like  drinking your Christmas tree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri, sorry about that.  Gerri Willis, we'll check  back.  Big opening, coming up.  Final thoughts real quick, you guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, listen, the White House doesn't have  to do anything to take away these subsidies from General Motors.  They  began expiring shortly as soon as G.M. hits that 200,000 vehicle mark.   They have to stand back and say, you don't get anymore.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

How  are you?  Thank you so much.  Happy Wednesday, ladies.  We will see you in  a few minutes.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And good morning, everyone, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  We're happy you're here.  It is Wednesday, November 28th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump versus Fed Chairman Jay Powell.  The President lashing out  at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p> It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this  afternoon, 12:00 noon.  </p><p> Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on.  The focus on President Trump's working  dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.  </p><p> The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air. </p><p> And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  There's disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than the United States.  </p><p> We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and  others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  President Trump confirming that possibility.  We are looking at  the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p> Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at  futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent.   S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.  </p><p> We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning.   We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for  the third quarter.  </p><p> Markets are up ahead of that.  </p><p> Gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p> The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points.  The NASDAQ was up eight  points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point,  and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third  of a percent.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the action is mixed.  FT-100 pulling back a  fraction, but the CAC Quarante is up 21 points, and the DAX Index in  Germany up 28 points.  It's good enough for a quarter of a percent gain in  Germany.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, gains across the board, take a look at the best  performers there, Japan, Hong Kong, China, all up better than one percent  overnight.  </p><p> Cindy Hyde-Smith holds on, the republican beating democrat Mike Espy to  keep her Mississippi Senate seat, bringing the latest in that late results.  </p><p> Plus LeBron James looking beyond basketball.  Details on his new venture  with Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lindsey Vonn in wellness,  offering energy powders and supplements.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p> And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and former Arkansas Governor,  Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee.  </p><p> Great to see you this morning. </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be with you, Maria.  Thank  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Good morning. </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Good morning.  Hopefully, we get  the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's  anticipating that. </p><p> That's a great quarter. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That would be a good quarter. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  We need it.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the President going after  General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax  credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down  for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've  hit this threshold.  </p><p> So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't  have to do anything.  They just have to step back and not extend it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the subsidies go away on their own. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer.  Tesla  already hit it recently.  </p><p> General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so  gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say,  \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these  billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government  Motors.  I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm  done with them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wow.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.  </p><p> And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're  not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel  and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump  administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing  them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what  Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S.  has been for a long, long time. </p><p> KELLY:  That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to  corporations?  I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Nope.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers?  So.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  We shouldn't be.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well -- and there was the bailout. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's why this is such a particularly important story  because a few years ago -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- this is the company that was bailed out.  Got a lot on the  table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General  Motors. </p><p> KELLY:  Crony Capitalism.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point that out.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yup.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big number, yes, you're right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Exactly right, Kevin.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and  member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.  </p><p> Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former  Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.  </p><p> Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.  </p><p> Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  </p><p> Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us.  Dr. Mike is going to joining us  as well.  Lots to talk about there.  </p><p> But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again.  The  President continues his campaign against Powell.  President Trump  criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.  </p><p> In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and  layoffs at General Motors.  </p><p> The President says this.  \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my  selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm  just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're  doing.\"</p><p> This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will  be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime. </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth  Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee. </p><p> Michael, good to see you.  </p><p> MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH:  Good morning. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.  </p><p> LEE:  So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success  in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher. </p><p> And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for  forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to  your economy over time. </p><p> When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no  inflation.  We need higher interest rates in this country. </p><p> I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long  overdue.  </p><p> And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the  macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks. </p><p> The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and  Bank of America which loans they can and can't make. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> LEE:  Right?  It just -- it shouldn't work like that. </p><p> And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching  overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.  </p><p> So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the  regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.  </p><p> So, I think the President made right choice.  I think he's unhappy with the  reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe.  But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the  Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as  the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the  impact of these rate hikes.  </p><p> What do you think?  </p><p> KELLY:  Well -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you really need four rate hikes this is year? </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close  to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say  we need to get back to neutral. </p><p> And guess what?  Guess who would agree with me?  Candidate President --  Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said  interest rates were too low.  </p><p> And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're  barely at breakeven rates.  </p><p> If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is,  it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?  </p><p> You can even have negative real interest rates.  </p><p> So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington  Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the  fed because his exact quote was -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut.  My gut tells me  more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p> He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\"   Well, guess what?  President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated  by the fed.  </p><p> Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy,  and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> KELLY:  He didn't do any fiscal policies. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And not only that.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are  going higher?  </p><p> We were at negative.  We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We  got to get back to normal.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in  a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used  to that. </p><p> Let's talk about policy over personality.  That's -- we're all used to  this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good.  Good.  Good.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you  know what, that's who the American people elected, number one. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Good.  I like it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise.  People  automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead. </p><p> He's not being hot-headed about this.  He's a real estate developer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the  -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this  country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for  six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for  eight straight months.  </p><p> Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the  economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral?  Are we  in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a  world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in  the last 30 or 40 years?  </p><p> Eight percent mortgage?  I don't think that this economy can handle that,  so -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And I don't think that's normal.  Is that normal? </p><p> KELLY:  That's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that the -- </p><p> KELLY:  That's (INAUDIBLE) housing.  Housing isn't affordable in a lot of  these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't  have speculation in the housing market. </p><p> And that's what they're preventing. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p> KELLY:  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's a reason why mortgage  rates are going to -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's not their job.  Their job isn't to prevent speculation. </p><p> KELLY:  Their -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Their job isn't -- </p><p> KELLY:  Their job is to prevent runaway inflation. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Runaway inflation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that's what -- </p><p> KELLY:  And what happens when housing inflations go up?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where's the runaway inflation?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  But there's no -- there isn't.  </p><p> KELLY:  There's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's no inflation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's what my point is, is that -- </p><p> KELLY:  Inflation is picking up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not. </p><p> KELLY:  That's why they're raising rates.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not.  And it's actually very, very tame.  </p><p> KELLY:  What housing market are you looking at? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p> LEE:  I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the  interest rate. </p><p> As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was  cost rates were much higher than they are right now.  </p><p> Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're  not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is  available, rates can be much, much higher.  </p><p> So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage  and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.  </p><p> So, as rates move higher, okay?  And credit availability increases, which  it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I  believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LEE:  What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone  pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again.  That's  changing. </p><p> Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened  since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's  changing.</p><p> Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened  since the election has changed that, okay?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LEE:  It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine  moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.  </p><p> We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is  going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page  story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed  is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.  </p><p> It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to  perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of  inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the  markets.  </p><p> That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article.  But -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP  today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and  a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.  </p><p> Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike,  but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at  noon.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know you're going to be there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm going to be there.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read  on that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision  in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy  in general.  </p><p> Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up  this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.  </p><p> The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi  Jinping.  </p><p> National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible  breakthrough in the trade talks. </p><p> He said this yesterday. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KUDLOW:  The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a  deal and he is open to it.  </p><p> But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago  are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's  perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here  actually? </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with  China.  </p><p> But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.  </p><p> I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but  to everybody.  </p><p> And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're  used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach  has gotten our heads handed to us.  </p><p> And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations,  does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.  </p><p> And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between  America First and America Only.  They think that he's, you know, some  nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not  true.  </p><p> But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the  American President and thank God for it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that  China has been abusing -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Terrible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- has been the bad actor.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  It's terrible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has been stealing IP.  </p><p> Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with  China at this point? </p><p> LEE:  Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic  breakthrough at this dinner.  I would -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> LEE:  I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these  tariffs down the road.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I think you're right because -- </p><p> LEE:  -- and continue talking, but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> LEE:  Yes.  You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally,  but that's short-term.  </p><p> This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going  away.  </p><p> The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to  open up markets and for peace and prosperity. </p><p> BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.  </p><p> You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and  they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.   There's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meaning they want to be number one in all the important  industries. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, including military.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Michael, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> LEE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael Lee there.  Count-up, Mississippi has voted, a big win  for President Trump as Cindy Hyde-Smith becomes first Female Senator  elected in the Magnolia State.  </p><p> Then climbing the ladder, how celebrities like LeBron James are teaming up  to create their very own wellness brands of protein powders and supplements  coming up. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p> Cindy Hyde-Smith first woman ever elected to Congress from Mississippi.   Cheryl Casone with the details now with headlines.  Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  </p><p> Hyde-Smith defeated democrat Mike Espy in a Senate runoff election after  President Trump visited the state on her behalf, holding not one but two  rallies.  </p><p> Hyde-Smith thanked the President during her victory speech last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. CINDY HYDE-SMITH (R), MISSISSIPPI:  Thank you so much for everything,  for the opportunities, for coming to Mississippi yesterday, two stops,  phenomenal. </p><p> Tupelo was unbelievable, the Coast was unbelievable.

And several senators are  calling for her to appear.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Pompeo wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" stressing the  importance of the Saudi-U.S. relationship, calling it a powerful force for  stability in the Middle East.  </p><p> Maria recently spoke with Prince bin -- Al-Waleed bin Talal. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A month ago, a brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, where his body  was dismembered, is Mohammed bin Salman for real or is he lying to us about  this modernization plan? </p><p> AL-WALEED BIN TALAL, PRINCE SAUDI:  As for the Jamal Khashoggi incident,  you know, you have to understand, Jamal was not only my friend, he was  working with me.  </p><p> Actually, his last job in Saudi Arabia was me and the Arab Channel.  </p><p> And I like to give through you my condolences, again, to his family, to his  wife, ex-wife, and to his children, and to his family because Jamal was a  reformer.  He was no opposition at all.  </p><p> And what took place in that Saudi Consulate was clearly horrific -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> BIN TALAL: -- despicable, and tragic and I believe that Saudi Arabia is  going to get to the bottom of it, but, please, you have to give us some  time until the investigation is done and made public by the Government of  Saudi Arabia. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Another headlines this morning, the price of Bitcoin  has bounced back slightly, now hovering around $4,000.  </p><p> Bitcoin plummeted as low as 3,600 last week amid concerns in the  cryptocurrency markets.  </p><p> A selloff coming after the head of SEC warned a Bitcoin exchange-traded  fund is unlikely any time soon.  Maria.  And those -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, interesting that he said that about an ETF. </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, technology's medical footprint, how companies like  Amazon and Google are mining your medical data to expand the field's  cutting-edge technology.  </p><p> We're going to take a look at the marriage of health care and tech. </p><p> Then wrapped in holiday cheer, Krispy Kreme unveiling its limited edition  Christmas donuts featuring an ugly sweater.  </p><p> We've got it, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big tech continues to move into health care, it  is raising fresh privacy concerns, though.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details on that.  Lauren, good morning. </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p> The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this,  you might appreciate what they're doing.  Let me explain.  </p><p> So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your  health data, your medical records.  </p><p> Why are they doing this?  Well, they want to make money, health care is a  $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save  money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first  time. </p><p> And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their  press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you  have software, and algorithms.  </p><p> And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical  text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the  limiting resource is time.  So, that's where they can come in and help.  </p><p> It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right  patients and the right drug trials.  </p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care.  Here's Toby  Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You are now an Advisor to Google.  </p><p> TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is  spending the resources on healthcare expertise. </p><p> COSGROVE:  You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the  high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether  watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or  Amazon and Google as well. </p><p> Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a  problem and, B, an opportunity.  </p><p> The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is  doubling every 73 days.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's an incredibly stat.  </p><p> COSGROVE:  Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage  all this data. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data  being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine  learning. </p><p> COSGROVE:  Exactly.  Well, on top of that, it also gives you  interoperability. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going  through you data in the first place with not getting hacked? </p><p> So this is the way we're moving, you know.  You go to the doctor now, the  doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an  iPad.  You see it all the time.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  We're there. </p><p> Do we trust algorithms? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us,  Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has  a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this  vehicle, they can perform many of the things.  </p><p> And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person,  the more important.  </p><p> So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it  takes in the vehicle.  It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit. </p><p> So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really  life-saving.  </p><p> It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I  recognize that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person  that she went to see for it missed it.  She was stroking for about five  days. </p><p> So, again, whatever it takes -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- for these doctors.  </p><p> And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even  just the management of the drugs that you're taking.  With my mom having  stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the  drugs that she has to take.  </p><p> Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital,  there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four  years ago.  </p><p> Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for  particularly catastrophic illness.  </p><p> And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech  companies with the data?  Why do we trust the government, governor?  </p><p> Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of  health information, why do we trust the government over big companies? </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Who says we trust them?  I don't trust any of them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's why I said that. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach  company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer  living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes  over to our homes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and  listens to us.  Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off  because they are -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So -- exactly.  So while there are risks in terms of privacy  and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the  positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care  outweigh it? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I  would trust Amazon and a big tech company.  </p><p> Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands  of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting  digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple  would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then  say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong  address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been  performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon  basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  I -- that's amazing that  data is doubling every 73 days in health care.  Lauren, thanks.  Lauren  Simonetti.  </p><p> Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the  company's plan to restart search engine operations in China.  More of the  fallout there.  Big debate around this. </p><p> And then life-sized art, one Dutch carpenter is undertaking to create and  sail a true to life version of Noah's Ark, we've got it next, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November  28th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> The President versus the Federal Reserve, President Trump slamming Jay  Powell, again, ahead of the Fed chairman's speech today, telling the  Washington Post yesterday, that h is not, at all, happy with Powell.</p><p> Fox Business will bring you that speech live, at noontime today, stay with  us, and you'll hear what Jay Powell has to say about where we are on the  economy, right now.  We are two hours away from the second reading on the  third quarter GDP.  Analysts are expecting growth in the GDP of 3-1/2  percent.</p><p> We will have those numbers, in two hours' time, for you, and show you how  it is impacting markets.  Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the  start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65  points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent  higher, right now.</p><p> This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials  picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the  S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p> In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very  much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up  eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points,  fractional moves here.</p><p> Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent  in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p> Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go  ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that  this morning.  Plus -- this, ahead of President Trump's upcoming meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, later  this week.</p><p> Plus, extreme weather, Sidney, Australia, hit by its average monthly  rainfall over the course of two hours.</p><p> And a new venture, LeBron James teams up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Cindy Crawford, for wellness.</p><p> All those stories coming up, this Wednesday morning, but first, this top  story, this half an hour, partisan divide over more tax cuts, House  Republicans now having a new tax package, facing opposition from Democrats,  who say they were blindsided by this proposal.</p><p> The House GOP unveiling their new round of tax cuts, this week, hoping to  pass it during Congress' Lame-Duck Session.  The package would revive  expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change  savings and retirement-related provisions.  Here's contributor from The  Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk  more on taxes.</p><p> Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this.  We've  been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months.  What's  your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done,  in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p> TATE:  Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety  of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and  the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you  mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of  disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's  tax law.</p><p> It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that  the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats  objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts,  permanent.</p><p> Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats  would have to agree to it and come on board.  But I've got to tell you,  Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this.   The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p> And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial  stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was  put together without their input.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time  around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan.  And as you say,  Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking  about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's not controversial at all.  But again, I don't -- the  Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you  make better decisions with your money, number one.  Number two, they are  not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, they're not.  But this is something the Republicans could  have and should have done.  They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to  come through.  They've got the votes between now and January.  And as Larry  the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know  this tax bill will get crushed, right?  Is it going to be middle of  December, is our last hope?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out  because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p> TATE:  Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has  a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic.  A  lot of this is about political optics, too.  I mean, the Democrats do not  want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law.   They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing  progress.</p><p> And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating  over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear  what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this  package that the President has been talking about because in addition to  making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants  to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do  you know, Governor?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be.  It's  one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but  unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is  never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget  that they were elected by one 435th of the American population.  The  President was elected by the entire country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's too bad.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And why is he still there?  He said he's stepping down, and  yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas  that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a  year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p> So, we ask, why now?  Why the subpoenas coming out now?  I don't mean to  change the subject.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  And I think that was so inept, I have to  say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta  Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner?   And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  It's all about the money.  It's who the donors are and how  they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has  been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with  obligations to all the donors.</p><p> He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental  difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more  effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  President Obama attending the  Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president  took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only did I not  get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way,  was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about.   In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to  get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p> TATE:  Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney  general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn  over documents requested by Congress.  His other attorney general, Loretta  Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill  Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton  were dropped.</p><p> But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time  right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming  from a former president.  I mean, right now, we are at the point where  leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs,  you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and  Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p> We need rhetoric that brings people together.  And by the way, I've been  equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well.  But, you  know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> TATE:  He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against  his political enemies from the IRS -- </p><p> TATE:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that  we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go  low, well, we're right there with you.  President Trump speaking and  communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us  see who all these people are.</p><p> And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make  jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense.  Again, they're all --  they're all the same, all of them.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in  particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because  they were protected.  Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an  illegal server.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I  think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted,  anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class  throughout their administration.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for  Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> KELLY:  Well, think about -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is such a good point.</p><p> KELLY:  Strzok and Page too.  I mean, that sets an example.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  You call it a matter, not an investigation.  And that's  exactly what he did, he called it a matter.  Kristin, it's great to get  your insights always, come back soon.</p><p> TATE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there.  Coming up,  Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the  torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater.  Then, Krispy  Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which  features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time.   Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial  China search projects.  Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  We have been talking about this for a while, Maria.  Some workers  at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in  China.  At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers  published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative;  it's known as Project Dragonfly.  They say it's a \"censored search engine  for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\"  The browser will  allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten  dozens of signatures in addition.  Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are  up less than one percent for the year.</p><p> Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia.  More than  500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average  monthly rainfall within just two hours.  About a dozen people had to be  rescued from their cars; they were trapped.  And thousands of homes lost  power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.  </p><p> Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size  Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story.  This is crazy.  He spent  almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to  sail now from Holland to Israel.  He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it  only makes sense to take it to God's land.  One problem: there's no motor  in the ark.  And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can  rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically.  So,  we'll see if he raises the money.  </p><p> And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this  year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes!   Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin  candy.  And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return.  Looks  like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside.  A  holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut.   All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts.  I apologize  now, Maria.  I failed you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that  story, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Very sorry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters.  Remember our ugly  Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  </p><p> CASONE:  So much fun.  I saved mine, by the way.  I'm ready to go for this  year.  It is coming back.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There we are.  Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are  coming to you with our ugly sweaters there.  Dagen, that was fun.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered  yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them  delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  I appreciate that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I did.  It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE).  And I still have it.   I've worn it multiple times --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually, I like your reindeer sweater.  Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think mine had a nose on the --  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Says who?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I don't need one for Christmas, there you go.  So, don't get me  one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, thanks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron,  how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a  path toward healthy living.  We'll tell you about the products next up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and  charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the  details, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria,  considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and  all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were  shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington  Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers.  While Foster is  not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team  facility.  Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent  allegations against him.  A lot of his former teammates who is are now with  the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the  decision to bring him on board.  </p><p> Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service,  joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of  live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.  </p><p> Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose  reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball.  Rob Manfred  yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling  operation.  Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM  Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly  suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out,  the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.  </p><p> What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy  Crawford, Lindsey Vonn?  A health and wellness company that they have  formed called Ladder. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL:  They say, you should do this alone.  </p><p> LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  That if you want  something done right, you have to do it yourself.  </p><p> LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER:  They say you should never ask for  help.  </p><p> ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER:  We say, there's strength in  numbers.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these  four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines.  There's  going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're  going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build  the ladder to wellness.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it wellness or protein powders?  I mean --</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is protein powder wellness?  </p><p> MAX:  Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say.  So,  there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way.   Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day,  get off of your butt and get running.  That's the ticket to health and  wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner.   Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did  was terrible but let's do some gambling.  </p><p> MAX:  And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of  fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this  morning, they have to get real on this.  </p><p> KELLY:  Pete Rose meet the deadline, though.  Didn't he have only so many  years he could be elected in?  </p><p> MAX:  You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader.  (INAUDIBLE),  did he bet against his own team?  Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough  already.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, you --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, I just want to say amen.  Amen and amen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> MAX:  Amen.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's why I like Jared.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah.</p><p> MAX:  I like this guy too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good sports stories today, Jared.

Good Wednesday  morning, everybody.  Good morning to you.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, November 28th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p> Breaking news this morning, President Trump is doubling down on the border  and the funding.  In a new interview with Politico, he says he's willing to  shut down the government over getting that money to build the wall.   Reaction this morning from Capitol Hill coming up.</p><p> President Trump is also fighting the Fed.  The President lashing out at Fed  chairman Jay Powell again yesterday.  This comes ahead of a highly- anticipated speech from Powell this afternoon. </p><p> Fox Business will take you there live.  We have full coverage of the  chairman's comments today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern.  He is speaking at the  Economic Club of New York.  Stay with us for that speech.</p><p> Meanwhile, we are on G-20 countdown, the focus is on President Trump's  working dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday in Argentina  at the G-20 meeting.  The question on whether they make a deal on trade is  still up in the air.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  The President said there  is a good possibility that we can make a deal and he is open to it.  But on  the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago are not  met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's perfectly happy  to stand on his tariff policies.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investors are showing some signs of optimism this morning.   We've got a rally underway.  Dow industrials set to open up 120 points,  about half of a percent.  The S&amp;P is up 10 points right now.  And the  Nasdaq is up 35 points, that's one-half of 1 percent.</p><p> We are waiting on the second reading of the third quart GDP.  That is due  out in an hour and-a-half.  It is expected to be a GDP growth of 3.5  percent.  That will likely set the tone for markets.  So stay with us on  this because that number is coming.  And it is important in terms of its  impacts.</p><p> This after gains across the board yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now  back in positive territory for the year with 108 point rally on the Dow  yesterday at the close.  The S&amp;P was up just 8 points.  And the Nasdaq was  up almost 1 point.  Fractional moves there for the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq.</p><p> In Europe this morning, a mixed story.  FT100 is down 15 points.  But the  CAC 40 in Paris is a quarter of a percent, 13 points higher.  And the DAX  index in Germany is up 11 points, fractional move there.</p><p> In Asia overnight, gains across the board as you can see.</p><p>Google is betting big on real estate.  The technology giant is expanding  its holdings on both coasts.  We're taking a look at the state of  commercial real estate this morning and what technology -- how technology  is impacting it.</p><p> Then Apple is raising incentives for trade-ins.  Get this -- the company is  hoping it will help boost demand for new phones.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  And joining me to  break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly and former Arkansas governor and Republican  presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Thank you.  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Happy to come.  Thank you and good to see all of you.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I'm just warning you and  warning the viewers that the both of us will become more and more southern- sounding as the morning wears on.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Dagen -- don't go there.  You know we won't do that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what I'm talking about.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  You know what I'm talking about too, girl.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's going to be -- it's going to be the Clampetts before we're  over.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are -- I want to see this, actually.  I want to see you both  get -- </p><p> We are watching the Federal Reserve today because Jay Powell is going to be  speaking.  What's your expectation in terms of what we're going to hear  from Jay Powell?  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  I think the market really wants  to see him be less hawkish, right, and more dovish because he said on  October 3rd that we are far from neutral.  And so the market didn't know  how to interpret that.</p><p> But we know there's going to be a fed rate hike in December.  They have to.   If they don't, then what are they seeing that the economy's not doing so  well, that they can't do a December rate hike.</p><p> So this is pretty telling what he says today.  And let's hope he's not as  hawkish on raising as many rates.  The market is anticipating for more rate  hikes this December and then three next year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the next meeting is in about two and-a-half weeks or so.  </p><p> KELLY:  December 18th.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  December 18th on the meeting on the Fed.</p><p> KELLY:  Correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have to wonder how he's going to respond to the question of  President Trump and what President Trump is saying about Jay Powell.  </p><p> HUCKABEE: But don't we understand by now that President Trump says things  sometimes to be provocative in order to, like a magician, say watch this  hand and while you're watching it, he's doing something with the other.   He's a populist.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that what this is about then?  Let's talk here because I'm  doing something up here.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Absolutely it was.  And what he's saying is these interest rates  are going to affect some people and home buying and car buying right here.   So he's saying I'm the champion for the people who want the lower interest  rates but deep down he understands what's going on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's also trying to set Jay Powell and the Fed up as the fall  guys and gals if something happens in the economy and the market.  It's  about political messaging.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  People don't realize that he is a very smart and shrewd  operator.  And he's always going to land on his feet.  That's the one thing  that the press still hasn't figured out about Donald Trump.</p><p> He's playing them like a cheap fiddle and his song is, you know, a number  one hit every time.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll watch the testimony.  We are going to take it live for  you.  So do tune in at 12:00 p.m. Eastern this afternoon when Jay Powell  takes to the podium.</p><p> Our top story this hour right now is President Trump doubling down on  border wall funding out of an important deadline next Friday.  President  Trump says he is, quote, \"firm in his insistence on $5 billion for the  border wall\", in an interview with Politico this morning.  He's willing to  shut down the government if he doesn't get that money.</p><p> House Majority Leader McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Schumer speaking  out on the battle over funding and what's at stake.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  The House version we  have $5 billion in there.  And the President is very strong on this.  I  think the President's very solid with where he wants to go and what he  needs to have a secure border.  </p><p> SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The Republicans are  in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate, a shutdown is on  their back.  Stick to the $1.6 billion.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is Texas  Congressman, House Energy and Commerce Committee member, medical doctor as  well, Michael Burgess.  Sir -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very  much for joining us.</p><p> REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Good  morning.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the border wall.  What are your expectations?   You're coming from Texas.  You are a border state.  What are your  expectation in terms of getting that money for the border wall.  </p><p> BURGESS:  Well, I think it has to be the $5 billion figure that the  President has articulated.  And we saw from the images over the weekend  that people that actually were able to find their way through the fence.   Look, every senator that's over there that was here in 2006 voted for the  Secure Fence Act.  So they apparently believed it in 2006.</p><p> But it's apparent that the fence is not working.  And the President is  correct, the wall is necessary.  People are getting hurt because they feel  that this fence is something they can slide through and achieve their goal.   The wall needs to be there as a matter of public safety.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why is it that the Republicans are not firmly behind this  president on this topic.  We know that there are many within your chamber  that actually wince when they hear that the President wants this money.  </p><p> BURGESS:  Well, I guess we'll see at the end of this week or the end of  next week, just exactly where everyone is.  But I think the President is  correct on this and he is correct to push on this.  And my belief is that  he will achieve what he needs to achieve.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And coming from a border state, tell us why you think it's  important.  I mean do you have any anecdotes for us in terms of what you're  seeing in the state of Texas?  </p><p> BURGESS:  My district is not on the border, although I do travel to the  border a lot.  And what I have seen, my experience on the border in both  President Obama's administration and President Trump's administration is  that we really have no border at all and people are able -- the coyotes are  able to deposit groups of people -- 14, 16, 18 people, women, children,  teenagers on the United States side of the border.</p><p> The customs and border patrol then are obligated to take care of those  people.  And guess what, a mile up the river you've got all kinds of  cocaine, fentanyl and heroin coming across the border.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p> BURGESS:  It is unsustainable the way it is going on right now.  Keep doing  the same thing over and over again, we're going to get worse results.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you are willing to shut the government down if the money is  not there for the wall then?  </p><p> BURGESS:  Well, it wouldn't be me that shuts the government down.  It would  be senator Schumer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know but if you vote -- </p><p> BURGESS:  It would be Senator Schumer that shuts -- because the votes will  be -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You just heard what he said though, Congressman.  He just said  the Republicans are in charge of the executive office, the Senate and the  House.  It's on them.  </p><p> BURGESS:  Yes, correct, he is right.  And that is why Mitch McConnell this  time will have to revoke the 60 vote rule for cloture.  And will have to be  a simple majority over at the Senate.  I think it's pretty straightforward.</p><p> Otherwise you end up in a mess which is where we've been for several years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> Let me switch gears to GM.  There's more trouble here.  The President is  threatening to cut subsidies to General Motors after the automaker  announced its plans to cut 14,000 jobs.  It's shutting down five U.S.  factories next year.</p><p> The President is slamming the company and he did so in a tweet yesterday  sending GM stock tumbling to session lows.  It was down 2.5 percent  yesterday.</p><p> National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow reinforced the President's  frustration.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KUDLOW:  There's disappointment that it seems like GM would rather build  its electric cars in China rather than in the United States.  We are going  to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others,  whether they should apply or not.  I can't say anything final about that  but we're looking into it.</p><p> Again, that reflects the President's own disappointment regarding these  actions.</p><p> Ms. Barra told me on the other hand, I want to be completely fair here,  it's her business -- it may be possible to transfer workers to other plants  in Texas and Michigan.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your predictions for the future?  Are you expecting jobs to be  transferred to Texas?  And should the President be brow-beating  corporations?  </p><p> BURGESS:  Well, first the good news is that you're correct, the TexasGM  plant was not one of those ones that were targeted for closure.  So folks  in Arlington, Texas won't be faced -- won't be faced with that.</p><p> But look, back in 2008 right at the end of the Bush administration rather,  I was -- I was pilloried for not voting to allow the President to move TARP  money over to the General Motors, to not bail out the automobile companies.   I did not think that was a good idea but it happened.  And it was done.   President Obama then took credit for it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BURGESS:  Look, the American people stepped up and gave money to that  corporation to keep it out of bankruptcy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BURGESS:  Many of us argued that a bankruptcy would have actually been a  more straightforward path.  Now they come back and say well, great that you  gave us this money but we'll be building these Bolts in China.  That just  doesn't -- people don't accept that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I could understand that.  </p><p> Real quick, sir -- let me get your take on the big news for the Democrats  today.  House Democrats are facing this key vote to select the next speaker  of the house.  Congressman, your expectations for the preliminary vote  today.  Will Nancy Pelosi be the next speaker?  </p><p> BURGESS:  Yes.  And it will be a tragedy for the country.  You remember the  last time she was speaker, the economy cratered and then could not recover  until she was replaced as speaker.</p><p> Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House of Representatives is detrimental to  our economy.  And it will soon become evident to people just what a mistake  they have made in allowing this to happen.  But make no mistake about it,  Democrats will vote for their speaker, that's what they have to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the infamous comments from Nancy Pelosi was her  calling all of the tax cut \"crumbs\", the tax cut money, she called it  crumbs.</p><p> And now the House Republicans have this new tax package and they're facing  more opposition from Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats.  They say they were  blind-sided by the proposal.  The House GOP is unveiling the new round of  tax cuts this week</p><p> You and your colleagues want to pass this during the Congress' lame duck  session.  It would revive expired tax breaks, address glitches in last  year's tax plan, change savings and retirement related provisions.</p><p> Are you going to be able to get this over the finish line?  </p><p> BURGESS:  In the United States House of Representatives, yes.  And then the  door closes when Nancy Pelosi is speaker.  Again, I cannot stress how  difficult it was on the economy when this individual was speaker of the  house before.</p><p> Unfortunately, people do have short memories and they do not recall all of  the things that led up to the crash of 2008.  All were on her watch, all  were on her watch and then the recovery could not get off the -- could not  get off the deck until John Boehner was sworn in as speaker in 2011.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, if that's what you're predicting, then I guess have you a  good shot to gain the majority back in two years then -- Congressman.  </p><p> BURGESS:  Well, I mean it's not about me or the majority, it's about the  country.  And we are entering into a dangerous time, I feel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- we'll be watching.</p><p> BURGESS:  But to answer your question, Democrats will have no choice.  They  have to vote for their speaker.  That is their rule.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> BURGESS:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Michael Burgess there in Washington.</p><p> Coming up, technology takeover -- Google is paying $1 billion for new  offices in the second biggest real estate deal of the year.  Details there.</p><p> Then more money in your pocket, how your old iPhone is gaining value.</p><p> Back in a minute.  Right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> New information in Indonesia's Lion Air crash -- investigators now  increasingly focused on a potential maintenance problem.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is  interesting -- Maria.</p><p> Indonesian investigators say that Lion Air mechanics may have made a  mistake that caused the deadly plane crash last month.  A preliminary  report says maintenance workers have failed to repair a sensor on the  Boeing 737 Max.</p><p> In an exclusive interview with Maria earlier this month, Boeing's CEO  Dennis Muilenburg said his company is fully cooperating with this  investigation.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what happened?  Apparently there were 10 computers -- the  computer, it's about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the  plane went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went  wrong?  </p><p> DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO BOEING:  Yes.  As the Indonesian authorities have  all pointed out, initially there was some indications of an inaccurate  angle attack signal that was being sent to the airplane.  And of course, an  airplane has the ability to handle that.  We have procedures in place.</p><p> And we've already issued a couple of additional bulletins to our operators  and pilots around the world that point them back to existing flight  procedures to handle that kind of condition.</p><p> So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation as it  proceeds.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Well, taking a look at shares of Boeing, up 7 percent  so far this year.</p><p>Apple wants more owners of older iPhones to buy new ones.  The company is  raising the trade-in value of the older phones through its give-back  program.</p><p> So basically, you can get $150 for an iPhone 6, $200 for a 6 plus, that  doubled Apple's old trade-in value for those particular models.  There's a  lot on the list.  You can go take a look on the web.</p><p> Shares of Apple have been hit hard recently by concerns about slowing  iPhone demand.  Maybe this is their answer.</p><p> And then, ok you've heard a dog is man's best friend.  Maybe a dog is  woman's best friend.  A new study finds women sleep better when they share  a bed with a dog rather than another human.  They report that sleeping next  to their pooch is less disruptive.  The dogs give them greater feelings of  comfort and security.</p><p> If case you're wondering, Maria, women who slept with cats did not show the  same benefit because sometimes cats decide let's jump around at midnight  all over the apartment and then maybe dive bomb the bed, just as an  example.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because dogs are more cuddly than cats.  WE know that.</p><p> CASONE:  Well.  Ok.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm a dog person.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Obviously -- that men are dogs, I guess it makes perfect sense,  right.  So there you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Now, that's an insult to dogs.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do Charlie and Ramon sleep on the bed?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, of course.  Ella Bella always slept on my bed.  And I love  that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Charlie is a great, great pal.  Ramon has a mind of his  own.  Ramon has been sleeping in the living room lately.  I don't know what  I did to make him angry.</p><p> But don't say men are dogs because that's an insult to dogs.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I need to go down to the emergency room, get the blood stopped  here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, a new way to watch -- how Audi and Disney plan on  creating content for self-driving cars.  Big story there.</p><p> Then oh, baby, Olivia is the second most popular girl's name this year.   The top names for girls and boys, coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the big business of real estate with technology is  spreading to Silicon Valley.  Google is holding the two top spots for the  largest deals of the year in terms of real estate on the East and the West  Coast.</p><p> The technology giant is spending $1 billion for a building in Mountain  View, California and more than $2 billion for a building here in New York  City.</p><p> Joining us right now is Rudin Management co-chairman and CEO Bill Rudin to  talk more about real estate today.  It is good to see you.  </p><p> WILLIAM RUDIN, CO-CHAIRMAN, RUDIN MANAGEMENT:  Good to see you -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> First, characterize what you're seeing in terms of real estate in New York.   What companies are doing much of the buying?  Where you're seeing the  expansion and growth?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, we're heading for a near record year in terms of commercial  leasing, over 30 million feet already year-to-date.  So we've already  surpassed last year's record of 30 million feet.  So we'll probably be  north of 32 million feet of commercial leases done with companies like  Google, Zillow, WeWork, Peloton (ph).</p><p> And then obviously with the Amazon announcement it's an incredible, you  know, signal that New York really is a technology hub.  Our city is  diversifying its economic base with these large technology companies, small  technology companies, but reaffirmed by Amazon committing to Long Island  City.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm so glad you mentioned Amazon because the headquarters 2 --  HQ2 we're calling it -- Amazon has chosen Queens as one of the places.  The  announcement facing backlash though over incentives and nondisclosure  agreements involved in these deals.</p><p> So Amazon's move, were you surprised that they chose New York?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, our project in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, we have submitted  along with the city to try to get them to go to Brooklyn.  But we're very  happy that they've decided to go to Long Island City.</p><p> But I think, you know, some of these issues that are raised --  infrastructure, education, they will be resolved.  The fact that when  they're moving into the first building it's being vacated by Citicorp.  So  there's not going to be an impact in terms of population.</p><p> But as they continue to grow, the city's already committed, you know,  several hundred million dollars for infrastructure.  There's a new ferry  service.  There's education requirements as part of the deal.  </p><p> So we think it's net-net, you know, for the future of the city -- very,  very positive.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think -- I mean that has to have legs, in other words.   Because Amazon is building this big project where it is, you say ferry, I  mean in other words, it's going to create a lot more economic activity than  what just meets the eye.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Billions and billions of dollars.  We're building a project right  now at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, not too far -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is Dock 72.  </p><p>RUDIN:  This is Dock 72, just not too far south of Long Island City.  And  we designed it with our partners Boston Properties and our lead tenant. We  work to really be the office building of the future.  It has all the  infrastructure, the technology.  It has the amenities.  It has a food hall.   It has a basketball court.  It has a conference center.  It has a wellness  center.</p><p> These are all amenities that companies like Amazon, Google and everybody in  between want to have so they can attract and retain their employees.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were just looking at it -- 675,000 square foot building  designed to integrate state of the art, modern class A office  infrastructure.  What does something like this -- how does it differ than  some of the typical buildings that you see in New York?  Why is this so  special and different?  </p><p> We work with WeWork, who is one of the preeminent shared office companies  literally in the world, to really curate and design the building to meet  the demands of the tenants of the future.  They want these amenities.  They  want the lobby to be a place where they can gather and talk to each other.   We can operate the building off of our iPhone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In other words -- temperature, lighting, you can do all that  from the phone.  </p><p>RUDIN:  We have a system that we created, our company called an Anthem and  we also have a building app so a tenant can order their food.  They get  delivered from our food hall downstairs.</p><p> They want to see when the next ferry is coming, they go to the app.  They  want to know when the shuttle is coming, they go to the app.</p><p> All of these things are looking to the future in terms of what companies  and their employees want to have this live-work environment and have a  place to enjoy themselves while they're working.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I love the pictures -- 14 feet floor to floor height with  eight feet of vision, unobstructed views of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Really  beautiful stuff.</p><p>RUDIN:  I'm going to have you as our rental agent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the demand and what you're seeing.  Is it  resonating?  I mean I want to ask you about domestic as well as foreigners  because for a long time the appetite for real estate by the Chinese was  very strong.  But apparently Chinese investors for real estate in the U.S.  has declined.  What can you tell us about that?</p><p> The \"South China Morning Post\" says Chinese inquiries dropped 11.4 percent  in September.  </p><p>RUDIN:  There's no question that the Chinese in terms of their appetite to  buy in the United States has waned.  They're selling product.  But we're  seeing other investors.  You see Canadians come in.  You see domestic  buyers come in.</p><p> And I think that just again shows the strength of particularly of New York  and the demand in terms of people wanting to be here and live here and  companies want to find the talent.  That's why Amazon came here.  They're  looking for the talent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So even though China real estate investment is down, it's still  number one.  </p><p>RUDIN:  No question about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Let me ask you your take on what you're seeing in terms of  the broad economy.  I mean real estate is a big portion of that.  So you're  talking about this booming situation right now for real estate and yet  markets are nervous, people are worried that growth is going to slow down  in the coming couple of years.  How do you see it?</p><p>RUDIN:  Well, definitely concerned about interest rates, and where the  interest rate market is going.  We're going to see the GDP come out today.   But we still see strong demand.  Housing -- there seems to be an  oversupply.  That markets have cooled down.  And we look at that as an  opportunity to come in, and as a buying opportunity for people that are  looking for homes, people looking to develop and find land a little bit  cheaper.</p><p> Hopefully this tariff situation gets resolved, so commodity prices will  start coming back down.  So those are big issues.</p><p> But we still see job growth.  And that really for our business drives our  decision in terms of where we want to invest, when we want to invest, and  what type of product we want to invest in.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where's the project now in terms of filling it up?  </p><p>RUDIN:  We are about a third lease with WeWork as the main tenant.  They're  building out their space.  We have very good activity.  We'll be opening  the building early next year.  We have a direct ferry connection that the  city is putting in right at the foot of our building.</p><p> So we've seen very good demand and hopefully sometime next year we'll be  able to talk about some leases and I'll come back to you and tell you, you  know, who's moving into the building.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this is an important client, an important tenant, WeWork.   I mean, they are expanding throughout the country.  What's your take on  WeWork getting so much of the capacity?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, we made our first deal with WeWork back in 2012-13, when we  net leased our building at 110 Wall Street to them.  And they did their  first WeWork, WeLive and they've obviously grown.  I think the value then  was $500 million.  Now we're seeing it over $40 billion.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's incredible.  </p><p>RUDIN:  And so, they provided incredible I think niche in the marketplace  for small companies and even large companies to find space on a flexible  basis.  That helps these companies grow and then hopefully they grow and  then they move into our building.</p><p> And at dock 72, we have the flexibility to make a long-term lease with a  tenant and if they want to take additional space on a short-term basis,  we're able to do that at -- with the We Work Space.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It looks beautiful, Bill.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, you mentioned the GDP.  We're getting the GDP out in an  hour.  We are expecting 3-1/2 percent growth for the -- for the third  quarter.  When we get that number, I see you today at the Jay Powell's  speech?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Am I going to see you at the Jay Powell's speech?</p><p>RUDIN:  I will be there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So will I and the Fed chairman is going to be speaking at 12:00  noon.  Are you comfortable with what's happening with interest rates, where  the Fed has been raising consistently, we're expecting another hike on  December 18th and then another three hikes next year?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, obviously, interest costs are a big component of our  business.  And we had 10 years of very, very low interest rates and it's  not surprising in our view that rates are starting to go up.  And -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is it going to slow things down a lot, though?  </p><p>RUDIN:  Well, I think hopefully not too much.  I think they're trying to  balance obviously inflation and the growth issues and employment.  But  we'll have to see what the -- what the chairman has to say in a couple  hours.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will be there.  Bill, good to see you.  </p><p>RUDIN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Bill Rudin, Rudin Management.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us, a lot to come.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning many happy Wednesday everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, November 28th.   Your top stories right now 7:35 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> The president against the Federal Reserve.  President Trump is telling the  Washington Post this morning, he is not at all happy with his choice of Jay  Powell as chief of the Fed.  That is ahead of the Fed chairman's speech  today at 12:00 p.m. at the New York Economic Club.  Fox Business is  covering that speech live.  We will bring it to you live at noon, so keep  it right here to get the chairman's comment.  </p><p> We will also have a second reading on the third quarter GDP in less than an  hour's time, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting the GDP to show growth in  the economy, of 3-1/2 percent.  We will have those numbers for you as soon  as they hit the tape and tell you how it's impacting markets.  </p><p> Right now, ahead of the number, Futures indicating a nice rally at the  start of trading, up 150 points on the Dow Industrials this morning, up 11  points on the S&amp;P and up about 40 points on the NASDAQ, going into the  numbers, we're now at the high of the morning in stocks.  </p><p> This after some modest gains yesterday on Wall Street.  Take a look, Dow  Industrials was up 108 points, almost one half of one percent.  The S&amp;P 500  was up eight points and the NASDAQ up a fraction, under one point higher  yesterday at the close.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are mixed.  FT-100 is pulling back, down  about a third of a percent.  But the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 20 points  and the DAX Index in Germany also up 20 points, fractional moves there in  Europe.  </p><p> Asia overnight, take a look, higher across the board, best performer was in  Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p> Watching in the car, Disney is teaming up with Audi to help you pass the  time when you're in a self-driving car.  Wait until you see what they're  doing, details coming up.</p><p> A deal of pure imagination, Netflix is inking a deal to produce a series  based on the works of Roald Dahl.  </p><p> Plus, move over Lucas and Riley, we've got the most popular baby names for  2018.  We've got the list.  </p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, oversees trouble for American  companies.  Facebook called to the Grand Committee on Disinformation in  Britain yesterday over allegations that's the company knew about Russian  data mining on the site as far back as October 2014.  Facebook's vice  president of policy solutions Richard Allan sat at the hearing next to an  empty chair left for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who did not show.  </p><p> Meanwhile, consumer advocates in Europe are filing complaints against  Google.  They allege the way the search giant tracks users' locations, that  it violates the European Union's data privacy law.  </p><p> Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And judge, it is good to see you this morning.  </p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning --  good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on all this?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, Great Britain, the parliament does not like it when you  don't accept an invitation.  I mean, this empty chair for Mark Zuckerberg  reminds me of political debates.  You've probably been through this  governor, where your adversary didn't show but you show an empty chair sort  of mock your adversaries at absence.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it is sort of a poke in the eye, isn't it judge?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It is -- it is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you know, they're under pressure, go explain yourself.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Agreed but I guess his people and he's got the best and the  brightest (INAUDIBLE) around him have decided that this wasn't the time or  place when to do it.  Now, this is not a subpoena, he was not legally  compelled to be there.  But as for the essence of what's going on, the  European Union actually has stronger privacy laws than we do here in the  United States.  And some of the data mining gathering and sharing that  Facebook and the Google, for example, engage in probably does transgress  E.U. privacy regulations in a way that would not transgress American  privacy regulations.  That's issue number one that they're very concerned  about over there.  </p><p> The other issue of course is the substance of that hearing at which Mark  Zuckerberg didn't go.  Didn't you know that the Russians were using  Facebook to data mine and why did you permit it to happen and to whom did  you report it?  They actually have e-mails from some Facebook engineers  reporting it to management.  They just looked up the IPS numbers and knew  it was coming from that catering place in St. Petersburg which as we know  from Bob Mueller and others was the source of all the Russian hacking that  occurred in Russia but victimized us over here.  Same location.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see regulation on these technology companies,  do you think?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes, I think you're going to see more regulation going  through.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What does the regulation look like -- what does the regulation  look like?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  I don't -- I don't know what it looks like.  But I do know  that you don't have a First Amendment to worry about in Great Britain so --  or in the E.U. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  So the regulation can be a little bit heavier.  Judges are far  less likely to interfere with it over there on the grounds that it would  impair the free speech rights of the gatherer, in this case Facebook, than  judges would be over here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think governor?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But don't you think judge, that at some point, we're going to  see that regulation come here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think so.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I mean, the AT&amp;T breakup --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've been saying this for two years.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But yes, but I mean, the AT&amp;T breakup of several decades ago was  far less intrusive.  I mean, people could still get a telephone.  Now you  have Facebook and companies like Google and Twitter who are saying you  can't say these things on these platforms.  So it's really come to the  place where they are no longer just social media platforms, they are public  utilities.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You know in my (AUDIO GAP) if you don't like (AUDIO GAP) go to  somebody else.  But there's very few somebody else's to which you can go.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Google --</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Because the barriers to entry are so extraordinary.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The amount of money is so tremendous that would be needed to  compete.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, the government --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but Google has what market share Dagen McDowell?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  90 percent of search.  They control 90 percent of search and  Facebook and Google combined control, what, 60 to 70 percent of all  advertising.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> KELLY:  There's two separate things here that were --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wait, can I just -- I want to point something out legally.   Because these companies are (INAUDIBLE) -- they are very much to your point  -- if you're going to censor content in the way that Twitter is more and  more, they're a publisher.  But these companies have liability waivers  based on the law right now from user generated content.  You watch those  liability waivers go away.  If they're going to act like a publisher,  you're going to get treated like one.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  So, McD as usual is ahead of us and is suggesting that if you  publish something on Facebook, Facebook's not liable for it.  And if  Facebook blocks it they're not liable to you for blocking it.  If Facebook  were to become just able to board where anybody could put anything on  there, then there'd have to be some sort of liability.  I don't know where  that's going to go.  </p><p> Quite frankly, Dagen, that is virgin, judicial and legislative territory it  has not been addressed yet in the United States.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you speak --</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  I am loathe to have the government tell Facebook what to post  on their bulletin board because they're not the government.  They're not  regulated by the First Amendment.  They want to kick me out, they can do  so.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Speaking about a different judiciary system, what kind of a  judiciary system puts a guy in jail and then decides what to charge him  with?  That's Carlos Ghosn, the embattled former Nissan Chairman Carlos  Ghosn hired a former prosecutor now to defend him.  Ghosn was arrested and  accused of falsifying financial reports.  </p><p> But judge, he's sitting in a jail right now in Japan, sleeping on a cot,  eating porridge, being told you can't speak to your family, and they didn't  even charge him with anything officially yet.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You know, I don't want to sound snarky, but he's lucky they  even let him talk to his lawyer.  This is a system where when you're  charged you presumed guilty.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's wrong.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It's not a system when you're charged, when you're presumed  innocent.  It's not -- it's not a western based system.  There is so little  litigation and so little prosecution in Japan, that they believe -- I might  condemn it myself, but they believe that this is a successful system.  They  charge you, you're presumed guilty.  You have to prove your innocence.  </p><p> Now, he has hired an extremely aggressive prosecutor, the person who  formerly ran the office that's now prosecuting him.  Right, this would be  like getting arrested in New Jersey and hiring Chris Christie to defend  you.  I mean, that's almost literally what he's done in Japan.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, judge, this really sounds like it's politically motivated,  that people within Nissan did not want to merge with Renault so they came  up with this stuff -- I mean, maybe there is wrong-doing here.  I don't  know obviously --</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, the allegate -- the allegations are --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- but there's no charges so far.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  The suggested allegations are income tax evasion.   The failure --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, $44 million.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The failure -- the failure to account for a large amount of  money in accordance with Japanese law.  But it is a --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But he also was merging a French company and a Japanese company  and the Japanese do not want to be owned by a French company.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It is reprehensible that the system exists today where you're  guilty until proven innocent but that's Japan.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, judge, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you guys.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for getting me riled up.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p> Coming up, Disney on the move, how the media giant is teaming up with Audi.  </p><p> Plus Liam, the second most popular boy's name this year.  What will be the  number one boys and girls names?  We will have the list for you, coming up.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Mike.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, Audi and Walt Disney teaming up to offer a  new type of media for self-driving cars.  Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, a big question mark on this one, Maria.  Think about the  future where drivers have -- well, self-driving cars.  What are they going  to do?  Well, Audi and Disney are working on a secret project.  They're  only calling, quote, a new type of media for those cars.  The big reveal is  going to be at the CES Trade Show in January.  But an Audi executive says  the new media will take full advantage of being inside of a vehicle.  They  also hit the tech could be used by back seat passengers in the near term.   What the media is, well, nobody really knows but taking a look at shares of  Disney, up more than four percent so far this year.  </p><p> Well, Netflix is bringing back Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.  The  streaming company has bought the rights to the stories of Roald Dahl and  they're going to turn them into animated series.  The books include Charlie  and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda.  </p><p> Many of Dahl's work have been turned into movies and Broadway shows but  this is going to be the first time they've become cartoons.  Production is  set to begin next year.  Shares of Netflix are higher in the premarket, up  more than 1-1/2 percent.  </p><p> Then there is this, the top baby names for 2018 are pretty trendy, to say  the least.  OK, according to BabyCenter, Sophia is the top choice for  girls.  That's the ninth straight year.  Jackson is the most popular boy  name for six years running.  But these are not the top choices.  Get this,  the name Ramirez has become popular, it's a character name from the hugely  popular video game Fortnite.  </p><p> And then, Kylie Kardashian named her daughter Stormi, that brought that  names popularity up 63 percent.  Apple didn't make the list this year.   Another random weird names I can't think off of the top of my head that  celebrities name their babies, but anyway, there you go.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like the list.  But Stormi.  </p><p> CASONE:  Stormi.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Are we sure that it's the Kardashians?  Stormi.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why are you laughing?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  We had to go there. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why are you laughing?  I don't even know why I'm laughing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter by the way, insulted my name because they  disagree with my position on illegal immigration in this country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is insulted my name on Twitter the other day.  And I said, well,  you know what, at least I know what a period is and can spell.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, making your dream job a reality, the secrets of  success.  Back in a minute.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Finding your dream job, according to new survey  by MidAmerica Nazarene University, just one quarter of Americans have  achieved this comfort level professionally.  </p><p> Joining us right now is career expert and the host of \"The Ken Coleman  Show\".  Ken Coleman himself is here.  Good to see you, Ken.</p><p> KEN COLEMAN, CAREER EXPERT &amp; HOST, THE KEN COLEMAN SHOW:  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We want a deeper dive into the survey that  shows 12 percent of Americans yearn for a c-suite level position.  Tell us  about it.  </p><p> COLEMAN:  Well, the bigger issue is that 25 percent, and that really lines  up beautifully with a recent Gallup poll that says nearly 68 percent of  Americans are disengaged at work.  So, you see those two stats coming  together and that's the real problem.  And so, when you see 25 percent of  Americans are in work that they really love, it's kind of sad given that  we're in America. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's not enough.  </p><p> COLEMAN:  And that you have the American dream still very much before you.  </p><p> KELLY:  It's pretty fascinating because I think dream jobs, some people are  want to be YouTubers or bloggers or what have you, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Or eBay sellers.  </p><p> KELLY:  Right, exactly.  And -- but how realistic is that and how do you  pair those -- the differences between the two, the realistic with sort of  the dream?  </p><p> COLEMAN:  Yes, I really appreciate that question, because dream job for so  many people sometimes is just all over the place.  What we do on \"The Ken  Coleman Show\" every day is help callers realize that they have the answer  for what they were created to do.  I believe were all created with talents,  things we do best and passions, things we love to do.  And the simple  formula to understand who I really am and what meaningful work is, because  that's what people long for, Kevin, is work that matters deeply to them.  </p><p> So when you look at I can use my talent to develop skills and use those to  do work that gives me great meaning.  This is what people are looking for.   And when you step into that role, it will really -- it really will be a  dream job because you go home every day fulfilled, even though you may be  tired.  And here's the best part Kevin, you wake up on Monday morning with  a spring in your step, not trudging to work with agony, which is really  where 68 percent of Americans really are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Even when you wake up at 2:00 in the morning, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, again, I love coming to work.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Me too.  I don't mind.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is my dream job. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Getting up at 2:00 a.m.  I love it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I do too.  And -- but I never sat back and thought I want to be  on T.V.  It's more of like how are you -- don't you talk your audience  through how do you figure out what satisfies you.  What rewards you.  For  me, it's working with somebody brilliant, harder working than anybody I've  ever known.</p><p> COLEMAN:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And supportive and so bright that you have this incredible  conversation.  That conversation is kind of, that's my reward.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right back at you.  </p><p> COLEMAN:  Here's the thing, we help people identify what is that Mount  Everest, that ultimate dream job.  But then, we take our eyes off of the  pinnacle and start with, where do we have to start?  You know, I liken it  to a mountain climb.  You know, you've got to train for that, you got to  prepare for that mentally, physically.  And there are stages on the climb.   Life's going to throw --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But still, becoming a business owner was the top spot in this  survey by a wide margin.  </p><p> COLEMAN:  Sure, because that's the entrepreneurial dream.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because people love what they -- they're doing what they love.  </p><p> COLEMAN:  That's exactly right.  They say, you know what, this is a problem  that I see and I want to solve it.  That's what entrepreneurism is.  It's  that's a problem, I think there ought to be a solution and there's a  connection for me.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  And Ken, you know, not always about money.  There are a lot of  people I see that love what they do, they do jobs many of us would not  enjoy at all.  They don't get paid that well but they love what they do  because they love life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have to take money out of the equation. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I always say that, take money out of the equation.  Got to love  what you do.  Ken, great insights from you.  Thank you.</p><p> COLEMAN:  Thank you, appreciate it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ken Coleman joining us there.  </p><p> Still ahead, President Trump doubles down, why he's threatening to cut G.M.  subsidies, that's next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Meanwhile, investors are showing signs of optimism this morning.  Futures  indicating a rally at the start of trading up 150 points on the Dow  Industrials, two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P up 11 points, almost a half of  a percent and the NASDAQ 36 points higher.  A half of a percent higher  there as well.</p><p> In less than 30 minutes time, we will get the second reading on the third  quarter GDP.  The expect -- expectations call for growth in the GDP of 3- 1/2 percent for the third quarter.  We will see how that impacts market  after gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are  now back in positive territory for the year after 108-point rally on the  Dow at the close yesterday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, not as strong.  Take a look at the indices here,  the FT-100 is down six points.  Fractional move there.  The CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 13 and the DAX Index in Germany is up six right now.  In Asia  overnight, gains across the board with the best performer being in Hong  Kong up 1-1/3 percent overnight.  The future of jobs in America, we are  taking a look at how Artificial Intelligence will transform the workplace  and how you do your job this morning.  We'll tell you about it.</p><p> Then, one of these things is not like the other.  Look at this!  This huge  cow is going viral this morning.  Look how enormous that car is.  We're  going to tell you why coming up and where that is.  All those stories  coming up this Wednesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly,  and former Arkansas Governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike  Huckabee.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks.  Good to be with all of you. </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Futures are pointing up and  we've seen earnings come out, do spectacularly well that's helped make it  go up this morning.  We had sales force yesterday afternoon.  So, there are  technology bellwether in the cloud.  And then you also had Tiffany's today  where actually they met -- they missed on revenue but they actually met on  earnings and they're operating margins stable.</p><p> And that after they've been reinvesting in their business and you're seeing  that time and time again from companies where they're talking about  reinvesting their business and it didn't compromise margins.  So that's  pretty telling.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What did you see in the salesforce.com numbers?  The cloud  obviously very important growth story for the economy.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Billings' growth actually was up 27 percent which everyone  was focused on and it seems like a company that can perennially grow at 20  percent.  And so that's really the focus because they've been such a leader  in the cloud for years and years and years and had high P.E.s, now that  starting to come down, they're getting free-cash-flow growth.  So you saw  it up -- it's up about 8-1/2 percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  9-1/4 percent right now. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  There we go.  Yes.  Even more.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Salesforce is going to be a real factor today.  And on Tiffany,  we've been having this debate about consumer for the last couple of weeks.   Did you see any cracks in the consumer and the Tiffany report?</p><p> KELLY:  No.  So actually the Tiffany report, they actually said the younger  shopper here in the United States actually helps support their sales here  in the North American market which is pretty telling.  They thought there  was going to be a slowdown in the Chinese market because they actually had  to cut costs.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they missed the same-store sales and the stock is down 10  percent.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So same-store sales has been that the one metric that is really  impact these stocks.  That's what happened last week.  I forgot what  retailer it was but it was the same store sales that sent the stock  reeling.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Earlier they reported we're on the 630 hours.  So we've been  watching this.  So management is probably talking right now and it's -- and  more numbers are coming out.  So it's not good on the same-store sales.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will keep watching retail certainly as a big  component of the economy.  President Trump meanwhile is blasting General  Motors after the company's decision to close a manufacturing plant in the  United States and lay off thousands of workers, Edward Lawrence is at the  White House with more on that right now.  Edward, good morning to you.  </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.   Anger would be an understatement for the President and west wing here at  the White House now job cuts and the announcement of closing five plants,  four in the U.S., one in Canada sparked harsher criticism from two world  leaders.  President Trump tweeting out yesterday \"the U.S. saved General  Motors and this is the thanks we get.</p><p> We are now looking at cutting all of G.M. subsidies including for electric  cars.  Now we spoke on the phone with Canadian Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau who echoed the same disappointment.  The Canadian Prime Minister  tweeting out, we'll be supporting Canadian autoworkers and families  affected by G.M.'s plan to close its plants.  The White House Economic  Adviser Larry Kudlow spoke with the G.M. CEO and told her that she needs to  reconsider. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  There is disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than in the United States.  We are going to be looking at certain  subsidies regarding electric cars and others whether they should apply or  not.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And politically this looks bad for President Trump who touted  manufacturing jobs coming back to the United States.  Economically, G.M.  says they have to make this move for the survival of the company.  G.M.  goes on to say that what happens to the plant in the U.S. will be a product  or a decision that will come out of auto union worker talks that will  happen next year.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Edward.  Thank you so much.  Edward Lawrence at the  White House.  We are certainly seeing a lot of conversation about that this  morning with regard to G.M.  Thank you, Edward.  Meanwhile, A.I. in the  workplace with Artificial Intelligence technology becoming more common, IBM  is now launching a new business with MIT to help companies adapt in a new  age of  A.I.</p><p>IBM says 120 million employees will have to be retrained by 2021 in order  to adapt to A.I.  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is IBM's  chief talent officer, Diane Gerson.  Diane, it's good to see you.  Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p> DIANE GHERSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, IBM:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before I get to the training and all of that, you are the chief  officer.  Tell us what the right skills are today for employees to thrive  in this new era of Artificial Intelligence.  </p><p> GHERSON:  Well, look, it's a whole range.  Obviously, there is cyber  security skills, there's the data science skills, there's front-end and  full stock developer skills.  These are the hottest skills out there in the  market right now.  You're finding a shortage and every company is going to  have to start developing these skills because they just don't exist in  enough -- in enough numbers.</p><p> Every company is being turned into an Artificial Intelligence company of  some kind, a software company of some kind.  And whether it's a bank,  whether it's an industrial company as, you know, everyone is in there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Even retail.</p><p> GHERSON:  Right, right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, if you're not putting A.I. in your business, then  you're going to get left behind.  </p><p> GHERSON:  That's right.  And there is a shortage of the folks about with  the skills today.  So, the real challenge at every company is facing is,  all right.  How do I develop those skills internally and how do I create a  culture where everybody feels like it's my job to keep continuously  learning, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really fascinating.  </p><p> GHERSON:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, how is A.I. changing what we do?  Give us some of the  examples of what A.I. does and how it changes the workplace.</p><p> GHERSON:  Yes.  I'll give you an example.  All of us apply for jobs, right?   And in the old days, if the company was looking for a job that would do  what was normally called a search and print, right?  You know, sort of you  put out some ads and you pray that the right people apply.  Now, the game  is so much more we understand who is out there because we've got all the  data.  And we go to people and we say, would you be interested?</p><p> Not only that but they can come in and take a look and they can say here is  my resume.  Find me a job that matches what I do.  And it might be in a  completely different field.  You might not even know that field exists but  because Artificial Intelligence understands enough about jobs and resumes  and if you have that experience and you must have the skills, it's able to  match you to jobs you never even dreamt of.</p><p> So that's something that we actually have on our Web site here in IBM and  it actually encourage more people than in any other companies to apply for  jobs because it's got that stickiness.  It's like OK, I could do that job.   I never dreamt of it, it says I have an 80 percent match when I apply.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  I like that.  Well, you know, you could imagine how A.I.  and machine learning, in general, scares people.  You know, we see these  robots who do things better than humans do and in all sorts of jobs,  robotics taking over.  I mean General Motors, recently announcing that it's  cutting 15 percent of its workforce.  Is A.I. to blame for that? </p><p> GHERSON:  Well, I think to a large extent it's because our employees in so  many companies haven't reskilled themselves to the future, right?  And it's  so important something that we do is we actually advertise to all our  employees, here are the skills that are declining that we will have a less  10 percent or more decline in demand for.  And here are the ones that are  growing.  And we encourage people to go and take those courses, take those  skills.</p><p> Get the training, move to new opportunities.  That's how companies have to  operate now.  You can't just go into a job and think, well, I got my  college degree, you know, I'm in jobs for like, that doesn't work you  anymore.  So that's I think a really important part of it.  And then the  other one is to be able to match people to openings to be able to say your  job is going away but this other job over here has a good match.</p><p> If you take these extra courses or this extra training and that's something  that Artificial Intelligence can help companies do.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, really important points that you make.  So you are  launching -- the company is launching IBM talent and transformation.  A new  A.I. fuel talent business to help build its modern workforce.  Tells us  about this and what this is MIT partnership.  </p><p> GHERSON:  Well, you know, it's a lot of -- lot of pieces to it.  We've been  at this -- as I said, you know, for four -- five years now, transforming  the skills-based of our company to match the new businesses that we are in.   Our portfolio has changed 50 percent.  So many other companies going  through this now and many of our clients have come to us and said, we like  what you're doing, could we do it too?</p><p> So this announcement of the talent and transformation business is really a  way of saying to clients we're in business with you, to help you do this  too.  And A.I. academy is one of those things.  So it's to help -- to help  train our clients, people, to learn the A.I. skills as they need for the  future.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's really --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GHERSON:  In IBM, 2,000 people have taken it, they signed up, you know,  overnight, they wanted it so badly.  And it helped people in a variety of  different areas get prepared for A.I. in their field.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is the coursework involved at this A.I. University?</p><p> GHERSON:  Yes.  It's got -- it's -- there is a variety as you might  imagine, there's a fair amount of coding, there's a fair amount of  understanding algorithms.  It looks at different applications of A.I. and  it's got a lot of tests.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can an older person in the workforce who has been on assembly  line learn this stuff now?</p><p> GHERSON:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And that's one of the most exciting  things about it, right? Is that it's not just for younger people, in fact,  what we found is our older employees have consumed more learning than our  younger employees because they know they need it.  The half-life of skills  is shrinking.  So their skills are less relevant than someone who just  walked out of school yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know we looked at the risks.  Do you see dangers risks for  A.I.?  And I know that it's hard to say, well, yeah, there are risks but  we're not going to change this because this where is the world is goings  but there are dangers, aren't there? </p><p> GHERSON:  You know, our experience is that it makes more meaningful jobs at  the end.  I'll give you an example.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's critical is what you're saying.  </p><p> GHERSON:  In payroll, you know, we have people who are basically copying  one database to another database, submitting it to a vendor.  You know,  that kind of work.  That's all now done by automation.  But the people who  used to do that work are now doing higher level work.  They're -- we call  them job bands.  So job bands are higher.  They're the same people.  They  understand the work but they're not doing the more rote work that  automation is doing for them now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a great analogy.  Very quickly before you go.  How would  you characterize the jobs market right now?  What's your sense of the  economy?  You see a plot of applicants.  </p><p> GHERSON:  I think the market has shifted in the last six months.  And I  find it pretty amazing, it's very much a talent market.  It is not an  employer's market.  Talent has the power.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because there are more job opportunities and if you've got the  skill set you'll get a lot of offers.  </p><p> GHERSON:  That's right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great stuff.  Diane, great to have you on the program.</p><p> GHERSON:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> GHERSON:  Bye-bye.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Diane Gherson from IBM this morning.  Coming up.  Pressuring  Powell.  President Trump taking aim at his Federal Reserve chairman again.   We're taking a closer look at that and have full coverage and analysis of  the GDP report that's coming out in about 15 minutes from now.  Plus, odd  one out.  The story of this huge cow that's going viral, straight ahead.   Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, tension on Capitol Hill today.  Senators, getting  a briefing on Saudi Arabia.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines  now.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The briefing is  going to be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary  James Mattis.  Lawmakers want more information on the administration's  relationship with the Kingdom amid its involvement in the war in Yemen and  the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p> CIA Director Gina Haspel not attending the meeting, despite several  Senators saying her agency has intelligence at the Saudi crown prince,  ordered Khashoggi's killing.</p><p> Pompeo, recently wrote on Wall Street Journal op-ed stressing the  importance of America's relationship with that country, here is what he  wrote.  \"Saudi Arabia has also contributed millions of dollars to the U.S.- led effort to fight Islamic State and other terrorist organizations.  Saudi  oil production and economic about stability are keys to regional prosperity  and global energy security.\"</p><p> Well, Mississippi has decided.  Cindy Hyde-Smith has become the states'  first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate.  She defeated Democrat Mike  Espy in the runoff.</p><p> That comes, of course, after President Trump held two rallies in the  Magnolia State ahead of that vote.  President Trump tweeted about it.  Say,  \"Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big win great in the  great State of Mississippi.  We are very proud of you.  With her win, the  GOP has now expanded its Senate majority to 53 seats, versus the Democrats'  47.</p><p> And finally, all we can say about this next story is, holy cow.  You got to  look at this.  This is just the thing's huge.  Six foot four Australian cow  is named Knickers.  The videos gone viral.  Knickers weighs more than 3,000  pounds.  This makes him heavier than some cars, taller than some NBA  players.</p><p> You will not find Knickers on your plate, just to be clear here.  He's too  big to process, says the owner.  So, he's going to live happily ever after  on that farm in Australia.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p> CASONE:  He's seven now.  He's kind of wild, I think.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How did he get that big?</p><p> CASONE:  They don't know.  That's the crazy thing.  They just said that the  cow just kept growing, they can't explain it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> KELLY:  How does he move?  She move.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good, that is good.</p><p> KELLY:  I will beef up the jokes later.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we got a few -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You got -- you, hey, you got a little more than 40 minutes to go  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got the GDP coming up.  Meanwhile, Tiffany shares are  down.  They missed quarterly revenue estimates as we reported earlier, the  same store sales were an issue.  The stock down nine percent.</p><p>Salesforce.com is up big as Kevin told us earlier.  We've got that on the  other side of this break.  Then, science sparking outrage.  The details  after a researcher claims he helped make the first genetically edited  babies.  Big controversy here, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a real controversial story here.  A  Chinese researcher is sparking outrage after he claimed that he helped make  the first genetically edited babies.  The researcher also revealing this  morning that a second pregnancy may now be underway.</p><p> This type of gene editing is banned in America and as the Associated Press  has noted, \"There is no independent confirmation of the researcher's claim,  and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by  other experts.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski,  better known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike, good to see you this morning.</p><p> MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, CELEBRITY DOCTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is really an interesting story.  But it's a technology  that allow scientists to alter the DNA of living cells.  And this guy did  it in an embryo.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  Maria, this is a story straight out of a sci-fi novel.   Because literally, what we're doing here is we're deciding what the future  generation is going to look like when we do gene editing.</p><p> There is incredible moral and ethical concerns when it comes to this, and  this is why the National Academy of Sciences had tremendous international  consensus when they said, \"If you're going to be doing human trials, you  have to be open about it, you have to go under ethics review, you have to  tell people what you're doing, and it has to be in a life-or-death case.</p><p> You have diseases like Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis that kill  people.  So, if you're going to be doing trials, do it on that.  This  gentleman did his trial in secret.  His hospital wasn't aware of it, the  university wasn't aware of it.  He was doing this in total secrecy, and  then he did it to prevent or, at least, hope to prevent an infection -- a  future infection with HIV.  This is not life or death, because we have  treatments for HIV.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  HIV is no longer a killer disease.  It's a -- it's a chronic  illness that we can control with medications.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He said he altered a gene in embryos for seven couples during  their fertility treatments.</p><p> KELLY:  Can we trust that he was actually able to do this?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  I mean, it hasn't been independently reviewed, just how the  Associated Press said.  But it sounds like it's true, there was also a  doctor from the United States, a scientist that was working with him on  this that claim that this happened.  But there has been huge outrage in the  scientific community and rightfully so, because this is unprecedented.</p><p> Gene editing is going to be the problem of my generation.  A lot of people  are worried about immigration, economics.  But gene editing is the stuff of  nightmares.  I mean, you can literally create biological warfare with this,  you can create diseases that are not affected by our current treatments.   You can create soldiers with this that can be stronger the -- </p><p> I mean, there are opportunities here, endless and very scary to me, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Under the umbrella as if you are actually helping the trial of  helping -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  And in secrecy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But we don't know how the person will grow up.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, let's get to something lighter here.  Hold the  cream, pass the butter.  The latest coffee craze involves adding butter and  oil to your morning cup of joe as part of a popular keto diet.  Dr. Mike,  tell us about this.</p><p> Dieters are claiming this helps satisfy their hunger like a meal.  I don't  really think I want butter in my coffee.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Well a lot of people claim that it makes them feel fuller, and  it probably does.  Because having a drink that has a high amount of fats,  they're using what we call MCT oil.  It does satiate your hunger hormones,  that is true.</p><p> Now, this keto diet, it's been a huge trend last year, this year, and it's  probably going to continue.  Because what we're finding is that diets that  are very low carb actually outperform low-fat diets.  And that's the big  story here because we grew up 20 years ago, 30 years ago talking about how  fat is bad and that's the danger to creating heart disease and all of that.</p><p> And what we're finding it's actually simple refined carbohydrates, sugars,  white breads, white pastas, white rice, eating those in large amounts is  actually what's going to courage you to gain weight, be unhealthier, and  increase the risks of diabetes.</p><p> KELLY:  I like it.  I do it, my wife does it.  Everyone should try it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have butter when you coffee?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, three times a week, at least.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're an animal.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Well, no, there are dangers of it.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  Do it.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  There are some dangers with it.</p><p> KELLY:  I look dangerously.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  You're like the new James Bond.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Talk to my case.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  We'll be right back with the GDP, right  after this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are about to get the GDP number out.  We are  expecting 3-1/2 percent growth for the GDP.  This would be the second  reading -- 3.5 percent is the number, right in line with estimates.  Let's  see if there's a market reaction.  We got a 3-1/2 percent growth number for  the second reading for the third quarter, and this was what we were  expecting, so it is a good number, certainly 3-1/2 percent showing growth.   We're going to dig deeper into the number and show you what it says about  consumer spending.  And as we bring in right now former Chief Economic  Advisor under George W. Bush, Ed Lazear to talk more about this.  And Ed,  it is good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p> ED LAZEAR, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH:  Nice to be  with you, Maria, thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  3-1/2 percent growth for the GDP follows the second quarter  which was 4.2 percent economic growth.  In the second quarter now, the  third quarter 3-1/2 percent.  Your reaction.</p><p> LAZEAR:  Well, obviously, that's good news, this is a considerable step up  from where we were during the rest of the recovery, as you know we were  down around two percent.  So, this is a qualitatively quite different from  where we were.  Now, the question, of course, is what does this signify  about the future?  I think everybody always wants to know what the current  numbers mean for where we're going, the current numbers of the past or  obviously what we're most much more interested in is where the economy is  headed.  I would say a couple of things on this.  You just mentioned  consumption is good.  That was strong in these numbers.  Investment has not  been quite as strong in these numbers and that's a concern.  Housing,  autos, obviously are the weak spot in the economy right now.  So, if I were  going to point to something, I'd say that would be the major concern.  </p><p> But going forward, I always like to use the market as an indicator.  My  view is that the best forecast of the future is essentially what the market  is telling us, so I always base my forecast on changes in the S&amp;P 500,  which as we know has not been great over the past few months.  And so, if  you look at that, the market is essentially telling us, that the next four  quarters, we would expect something like two percent growth as opposed to  three percent growth.  Hopefully, the market got it wrong, and we'll be  able to revise that, but right now, that's where we are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending was revised lower in this report and the  market is weakening here, any reduction to what the market is telling us on  this news?  Is this basically saying the Fed keeps up the rate hikes?</p><p> LAZEAR:  Well, two things, one is you don't want to look at, you know,  short-run movements in the market.  I mean, you know, certainly minute to  minute but even day to day, tend not to be the kinds of things that I rely  on.  I tend to look at something like three months or six months.  In terms  of the Fed, you know, the Fed is in kind of a difficult situation right  now, because they probably would rather have had rates high already and  have been at a place where they'd like to be, so they had some flexibility.   But they're -- you know, this is kind of the situation where you decide  you're an hour late for the ball, and the question is should you drive  twice the speed limit to get there?  And I don't think that's a very good  strategy for them, and I think, the chairman probably knows that.  So, in  terms of --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And we're -- and we're going to hear from the chairman  today that the Fed chairman is going to speak at 12:00 noon, Dagen, and we  know that we are waiting for any expectations of what he says on inflation  and this growth number.  Your reaction? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The -- I was just looking into the number.  So you -- consumer  spending, it came in in the initial reading, it was running at a four  percent rate, and in this report, it came in at --</p><p> KELLY:  3.6.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- 3.6 percent.  Thank you.  I was looking through the --  through the write through on this.  But in terms of interest rates, The  Wall Street Journal, this morning, highlights the predicament that all  investors will be in with the Federal Reserve.  And how these speeches from  the likes of Jay Powell matter even more because we're going into the New  Year, fully expected that the Fed does hike at its December 18th, 19th  meeting.  But looking into 2019, there's a real split, do they raise two  times, three times, four times?  That is the outlook, it's really wide- open, so it creates the potential for more volatility in the stock market.   And not just stocks, but also the bond market and across all of the asset  classes that have sold off so sharply this year.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Ed, this is Mike Huckabee.  What do you think is the key factor  that has driven the GDP to rise starkly since the last election?  I mean, I  think that's maybe a burning question, and if it's something tangible that  was done, why don't we keep doing it?</p><p> LAZEAR:  Well, that's a good question, and I think it's the obvious two  things that people always talk about, one is taxes and one is the new  regulatory regime.  So, if we're thinking about how this administration  views markets and business in general as compared with the last  administration, it's quite a different story.  So, if I'm an investor, if  I'm a businessperson, trying to figure out what to do in the future, and  I'm looking at the situation today, versus a situation three years ago,  this is a much more positive situation.  Now, you said, you know, what --  if this worked in the past, what can we continue to do?  </p><p> Obviously, we know there's a movement right now to try to do a bit more on  the tax front.  You know, that's going to be pretty tough sledding, I  think, in a lame-duck Congress.  But obviously, if it were to get done that  would have some effect.  Most of the action would come about through the  saving and investment vehicles, because that's really where the growth --  the growth lies.  It's the other stuff may be important, may be useful, but  in terms of affecting economic growth, it's primarily saving an investment  that does it.  If we don't have much action on that front, we're not going  to have much growth from the tax legislation even if it were to pass.</p><p> KELLY:  Ed, it's Kevin Kelley.  As we hit home about the household spending  grew 3.6 percent but it was down from four percent, and that was because of  lower durable-goods orders.  And we're talking about spending an investment  that you -- in order for our GDP to keep going at this.  Where do you see  first quarter GDP, and GDP going next year?  Because I can't drive looking  through the rear-view mirror.  So, we've had a great couple quarters but  everyone is worried that sugar high from the tax cuts are going to come  down.</p><p> LAZEAR:  Yes, I guess.  I don't see the tax cuts as so much of a sugar  high, people talk about it as a stimulus.  I don't think of it as a  stimulus.  I actually thought of the tax bill as moving to a more efficient  way of collecting the revenues that the government needs.  We -- virtually  all economists agree that the most pernicious tax in terms of economic  growth, is tax on capital.  So, the reduction in taxes on capital were a  positive factor in terms of long-term economic growth.  It's not just the  sugar high as you mentioned.  So, I would think that that would continue to  be a positive force.</p><p> Again, going for the, you know, the next quarter, the next four quarters,  obviously, the market is seeing something that it doesn't like today as  much as it liked a few months back.  And so, that's an important caution,  and I think the -- you know, the fact that consumption is a little lower  than it was is not quite as troubling to me, but the softness in the  housing market that we've seen over the past few months, I think is a  concern, and it's something that we need to keep watching.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's Dagen McDowell.  Why haven't the corporate tax cuts  resulted in faster business investment and business spending?  Looking at  this -- the second report on third quarter GDP.  So, the consumer spending  came in a little bit lower.  Business spending was a little bit higher,  among a couple of elements.  Business spending on equipment increased at 3- 1/2 percent rate, that's ahead of the -- </p><p> LAZEAR:  You're right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- four-tenths of one percent increase previously reported, but  that's still the slowest pace in two years.  So, why aren't businesses  stepping up?</p><p> LAZEAR:  Well, I would say it's a couple things.  First of all, there's a  change in the nature of investment in the last quarter.  As you know, if  you look at -- you mentioned durables and some of the other factors,  equipment, structures, have not been great, but on the -- on the  intellectual property front, technology, that's been pretty good.  So, that  was an offset there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really important topic.  This is a really important  point that you're making.  This is also what I got from a leading figure in  the corporate world recently when I asked the same exact question that you  just did.  And he said that when you invest in things like technology, and  A.I., which those investments are soaring, that becomes a write-off, that  doesn't go in the category of business spending.  </p><p> So, while it looks like businesses have stopped or slowed down their  spending quite substantially, they may not be spending on the assembly line  but they're spending on technology which often becomes a write-off on the  balance sheet.  And so, it doesn't go into the category of spending, but  that spending is up big.  So, that's what you just said, and I was happy  you said that because that confirms what I had been hearing as well.   Sorry, continue, please.</p><p> LAZEAR:  That's right.  And the good news on that, of course, is spending  on technology has positive long run effects for us.  So, if you're talking  about future growth and you're thinking, you know, what are -- what are the  two most important things that affect the future?  It's primarily  technology and human capital.  So, investment in people and investment in  machines and new technology.  That's the way you make the economy grow.</p><p> So, hopefully, we'll see that pan out over the next few years.  Sometimes  these things have very long legs.  I don't know if you remember, Maria, but  there was a period when everybody was waiting for the I.T. -- all the I.T.  investments and all the innovation in I.T. to translate into manufacturing,  all kinds of increases, and it took a long time for that to happen.   Actually, it didn't happen until the late 90s.  So, sometimes these things  are slower than we would like, but the fact that we're doing that at least  is a good sign, not only from the accounting point of view that you -- that  you mentioned, which I think is an extremely important point, but beyond  that, just in terms of the structure as we go forward. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But to Dagen's point, do you think the investment in things  like, you know, assembly line, in deals, in other areas will come back?   Or, should we be looking at business investment in a different way?</p><p> LAZEAR:  Well, I -- you know, the -- I would say the second factor there,  of course, is the real interest rate, and we know that real interest rates  are rising.  And that tends to dampen investment, incentives a bit.  I  think, you know, as the Governor had mentioned earlier, the overwhelming  factor is going forward are the ones that really relate to taxes, to  regulation, to the whole administration's outlook on business in general.   And so, I would think that would be the more fundamental force, but you  know, we've had a -- hopefully, a blip in this quarter, and we'll see it  come back later on.  Again, to me, the most --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you mentioned rates -- yes, go ahead.</p><p> LAZEAR:  I'm sorry, go ahead, please.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, finish your thought.  Go ahead.</p><p> LAZEAR:  No, I was going to say, to me, the most -- the most concerning  issue is why the market is not -- is not seeing that, not reacting more  positively than it has been.  And my guess is that has a bit to do with the  slowdown in the global economy, and also, some of the sectors that you're  talking about here, particularly housing and autos.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you mentioned rates, Ed.  What's your take on President  Trump slamming Fed Chief Jay Powell?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He did in an interview again yesterday with The Washington  Post.  He is blaming him for the recent stock market declines, he's even  blaming him for the layoffs at General Motors.  Here's the quote:  \"So far,  I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay.  And I'm not  blaming anybody, but I'm just telling you, I think that the Fed is way off- base with what they are doing.\"  Are they off-base?</p><p> LAZEAR:  Well, you know, the President's rarely reticent to criticize  people with whom he doesn't agree, and I don't know that Powell should be  any different.  I guess, I think -- yes, I think he is way off.  I think  that Powell has been doing a pretty good job, he's following a path that's  a stable and consistent path, it's careful.  It is getting to us the kinds  of rates that we really need for the long run.  So, I don't think there's  anything wrong with that, obviously Presidents always want to see lower  interest rates, particularly a President like President Trump who has a  background in investment and real estate and so forth, and likes low  interest rates.  So, it's not a surprise to me that the President would  like to see lower interest rates, but it's also not a surprise to me that  the chairman is acting independently and following his best judgment.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just be careful what you wish for, Ed, because if you get lower  interest rates that's the market, if you're talking about longer-term  interest rates, that's the market telling you that the economy is headed  into the tank.</p><p> LAZEAR:  Yes.  Well, that's -- you know, that's right, I mean, the big  thing, of course, you always worry about is yield curve slope and  inversions, and so forth, and you flow, we saw that in spades when I was in  the government back, you know, during financial crisis. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LAZEAR:  And that is a concern, but, again, I don't see that as the major  issue right now, I think the major issue going forward, is do we continue  to have a pro-market kind of environment.  I wouldn't say pro-business, I'd  actually say pro-market.  This doesn't mean that you want to pump up  businesses, you want to make sure that the market is able to function.  You  know, everybody has been -- I'm sorry, go ahead, please. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, no, we're going to go.  But, Ed, just to be clear, you're  not expecting a big slowdown then in the next two years?  Very quickly, we  got to jump, Ed.</p><p> LAZEAR:  Right, I don't see a big slowdown.  I mean, it may slow some, but  I don't see a big slowdown.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Ed.  We'll see you soon, Sir.  Ed Lazear.  Stay with  Fox Business.</p><p> LAZEAR:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Live coverage of Fed Chairman Jay Powell 12:00 p.m. today.   Back in a minute. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump is tweeting this morning on the  Mueller probe.  Here's what the President just wrote:  \"While the  disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report  it that way, at least three major players are intimating that the angry  Mueller gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts and  they will get relief.  This is our Joseph McCarthy era!\"  Wow, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, there's an argument made for what's going on with the Paul  Manfort, the rejection of the plea deal that's happening is that this is  his way of signaling -- there are a lot of reports out, I'm not going to go  into great detail about them.  He's way of signaling that the Mueller team  has tried to put pressure on him, and to set him up for potential pardon  down the road.  This is something that Andy McCarthy has -- was writing  about yesterday, I'll say that.  But if Mueller -- if Mueller pursues or  pushes for state charges against Paul Manafort, not at the federal level,  but at the state level, the President doesn't have any pardon power over  Paul Manafort in those instances.  So, there's a -- there are a lot of  moving pieces to this going on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And my take on this is it's time, it's time for the  American people to know what Robert Mueller is working on.  It's time.   It's been two years, let's see what you've got.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Let's not forget the whole thing was about did Donald Trump  collude with the Russians to interfere with the election?  And if there's  no evidence of that, then the fact that Paul Manafort did some really  squirrely things when he was in private business, before he was ever  associated with Donald Trump, let us know that, so that we can quit blaming  the President --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- for something that had nothing to do with him.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, the notable guilty pleas so far in the Mueller  investigation, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn, those  are process crimes, those are lying to investigators, those are not crimes  related to Russia collusion.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But the media just fails to, you know, separate this,  and be -- and have honesty about it because there's been no evidence of any  collusion.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we got good news today.  The revised GDP number for the third  quarter up 3-1/2 percent in line with estimates.  The host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighing in in now.  And Stu, we were expecting a  good number, we got it.  You don't love the number.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't -- I'm not in love  with a 3.5 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want more.  You want more.</p><p> VARNEY:  I do, I do.  Well, look at this, in the second quarter, four  percent growth.  Third quarter, three percent growth.  Fourth quarter,  we're looking at 2 percent growth.  I don't like a down trend, I want a  solid up trend.  That's what I want to see, and I don't think we are going  to see that.  And by the way, if I can just say this, you're dead right on  Mueller, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p> VARNEY:  What do you got?  Show it, two years?  Put it on the damn table.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Come on.  Come on.</p><p> VARNEY:  Excuse me.  Put it on the table.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wait a minute.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's enough.  Enough with the speculating.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Alan Dershowitz said yesterday, he thinks that the Mueller  report comes out before the Democrats take the House -- takeover the House  in January.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see if we get it by year-end.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's his speculation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what does it say?  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  We  know you've got a lot in the show.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart  and his fantastic panel.</p><p> But first, we are driving into the future, next.  We're checking out the  coolest cars at the L.A. Auto --</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Driving into the future, Jeff Flock live at the  Los Angeles Auto Show, checking out the coolest cars this year.  Jeff?</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Although, I tell you, the  cars may take a backseat to the news.  I'm at the G.M. exhibit, Chevy, GMC  that sort of thing.  You know, it was weeks ago that G.M. told us, and we  were puzzled why there weren't any executives going to be at the L.A. show.   And we're not so puzzled anymore.  Take a look at the Presidential tweets.   I need to get my glasses out to read them.  \"Very disappointed with General  Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan, and  Maryland.  Nothing being closed in Mexico and China.  U.S. saved General  Motors, and this is the thanks we get?  We're looking at cutting G.M.  subsidies including for electricity cars.  G.M. made a big bet in China  years ago when they built plants there, and in Mexico, don't think that bet  is going to pay off.  I'm here to protect American workers!\"</p><p> Well, you know, we'll see.  That's the buzz of the show, though.  Other  buzz, look at the Beetle.  That is the last edition of the Beetle, do you  believe it?  Well, I don't know if you can believe it.  They say it is.   But if you spin around -- spin over here, you remember, there was a last  edition of the Beetle before, that's the real old Beetle.  </p><p> By the way, I'll leave you with this, Maria.  That over there, the blue and  white, that is an electric cargo van that the V.W. is also now going to  sell.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Cool.  All right, Jeff, thank you so much.  Some cool -- some  cool wheels there, Jeff Flock.  Forget --</p><p> Coming up, forget hot chocolate, details on the new winter drink from  Starbucks that tastes like juniper and sage.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, we're expecting a big open on the upside.   But look at Tiffany shares, down 12-1/4 percent right now on the same-store  sales weakness, and the earnings news we told you about earlier.  Gerri  Willis on the floor of the New York Stocks Exchange with more.  Gerri, good  morning to you.</p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right, Tiffany is down as much as 13 percent premarket, after the company  registered lower-than-expected earningsm, $0.77 a share versus $0.78.   Profits down on higher-than-expected investment spending on stores and also  a charged they didn't expect to take for the bankruptcy of a precious  metals refinery.  So, those shares down.  Same-store sales also not  terrific.</p><p> Meanwhile, Burlington, let's talk about that company, it's the opposite  side of the equation.  That stock up dramatically this morning, seven  percent on higher-than-expected earnings.  The discount store chain doing  very well indeed.</p><p> Meanwhile, the big story that everybody is paying attention to today,  Starbucks with their juniper sage latte.  I have it right here in my hot  little hands, tried it, I've got to tell you, not loving it.  It's like  drinking your Christmas tree.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri, sorry about that.  Gerri Willis, we'll check  back.  Big opening, coming up.  Final thoughts real quick, you guys.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, listen, the White House doesn't have  to do anything to take away these subsidies from General Motors.  They  began expiring shortly as soon as G.M. hits that 200,000 vehicle mark.   They have to stand back and say, you don't get anymore.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

How are you? Thank you so much. Happy Wednesday, ladies. We will see you in a few minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good morning, everyone, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo. We're happy you're here. It is Wednesday, November 28th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump versus Fed Chairman Jay Powell. The President lashing out at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p>It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this afternoon, 12:00 noon.</p><p>Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on. The focus on President Trump's working dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.</p><p>The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air.</p><p>And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: There's disappointment that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China rather than the United States.</p><p>We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump confirming that possibility. We are looking at the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.</p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent. S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.</p><p>We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning. We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for the third quarter.</p><p>Markets are up ahead of that.</p><p>Gains across the board yesterday as well. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back in positive territory for 2018.</p><p>The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points. The NASDAQ was up eight points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point, and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the action is mixed. FT-100 pulling back a fraction, but the CAC Quarante is up 21 points, and the DAX Index in Germany up 28 points. It's good enough for a quarter of a percent gain in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board, take a look at the best performers there, Japan, Hong Kong, China, all up better than one percent overnight.</p><p>Cindy Hyde-Smith holds on, the republican beating democrat Mike Espy to keep her Mississippi Senate seat, bringing the latest in that late results.</p><p>Plus LeBron James looking beyond basketball. Details on his new venture with Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lindsey Vonn in wellness, offering energy powders and supplements.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be with you, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Good morning. Hopefully, we get the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's anticipating that.</p><p>That's a great quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That would be a good quarter.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. We need it.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And the President going after General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've hit this threshold.</p><p>So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't have to do anything. They just have to step back and not extend it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the subsidies go away on their own.</p><p>MCDOWELL: After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer. Tesla already hit it recently.</p><p>General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say, \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government Motors. I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm done with them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wow.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.</p><p>And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well --</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S. has been for a long, long time.</p><p>KELLY: That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to corporations? I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy --</p><p>HUCKABEE: Nope.</p><p>KELLY: -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers? So.</p><p>HUCKABEE: We shouldn't be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- and there was the bailout.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's why this is such a particularly important story because a few years ago --</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- this is the company that was bailed out. Got a lot on the table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General Motors.</p><p>KELLY: Crony Capitalism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point that out.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yup.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big number, yes, you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Exactly right, Kevin.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.</p><p>Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.</p><p>Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.</p><p>Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us. Dr. Mike is going to joining us as well. Lots to talk about there.</p><p>But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again. The President continues his campaign against Powell. President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.</p><p>In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and layoffs at General Motors.</p><p>The President says this. \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're doing.\"</p><p>This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee.</p><p>Michael, good to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.</p><p>LEE: So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher.</p><p>And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to your economy over time.</p><p>When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no inflation. We need higher interest rates in this country.</p><p>I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long overdue.</p><p>And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks.</p><p>The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and Bank of America which loans they can and can't make.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LEE: Right? It just -- it shouldn't work like that.</p><p>And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.</p><p>So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.</p><p>So, I think the President made right choice. I think he's unhappy with the reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe. But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the impact of these rate hikes.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>KELLY: Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you really need four rate hikes this is year?</p><p>KELLY: Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say we need to get back to neutral.</p><p>And guess what? Guess who would agree with me? Candidate President -- Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said interest rates were too low.</p><p>And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're barely at breakeven rates.</p><p>If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is, it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?</p><p>You can even have negative real interest rates.</p><p>So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the fed because his exact quote was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.</p><p>KELLY: -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut. My gut tells me more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p>He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\" Well, guess what? President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated by the fed.</p><p>Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy, and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: He didn't do any fiscal policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And not only that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are going higher?</p><p>We were at negative. We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We got to get back to normal.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used to that.</p><p>Let's talk about policy over personality. That's -- we're all used to this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good. Good. Good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you know what, that's who the American people elected, number one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Okay. Good. I like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise. People automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead.</p><p>He's not being hot-headed about this. He's a real estate developer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for eight straight months.</p><p>Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral? Are we in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in the last 30 or 40 years?</p><p>Eight percent mortgage? I don't think that this economy can handle that, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And I don't think that's normal. Is that normal?</p><p>KELLY: That's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that the --</p><p>KELLY: That's (INAUDIBLE) housing. Housing isn't affordable in a lot of these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't have speculation in the housing market.</p><p>And that's what they're preventing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right.</p><p>KELLY: That's exactly what they're doing. There's a reason why mortgage rates are going to --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's not their job. Their job isn't to prevent speculation.</p><p>KELLY: Their --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Their job isn't --</p><p>KELLY: Their job is to prevent runaway inflation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Runaway inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that's what --</p><p>KELLY: And what happens when housing inflations go up?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where's the runaway inflation?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. But there's no -- there isn't.</p><p>KELLY: There's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's no inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what my point is, is that --</p><p>KELLY: Inflation is picking up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not in housing, it's not.</p><p>KELLY: That's why they're raising rates.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not in housing, it's not. And it's actually very, very tame.</p><p>KELLY: What housing market are you looking at?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p>LEE: I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the interest rate.</p><p>As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was cost rates were much higher than they are right now.</p><p>Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is available, rates can be much, much higher.</p><p>So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.</p><p>So, as rates move higher, okay? And credit availability increases, which it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>LEE: What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again. That's changing.</p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's changing.</p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened since the election has changed that, okay?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>LEE: It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.</p><p>We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.</p><p>It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the markets.</p><p>That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article. But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.</p><p>Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike, but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at noon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know you're going to be there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm going to be there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy in general.</p><p>Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.</p><p>The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi Jinping.</p><p>National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible breakthrough in the trade talks.</p><p>He said this yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW: The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a deal and he is open to it.</p><p>But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here actually?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with China.</p><p>But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.</p><p>I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but to everybody.</p><p>And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach has gotten our heads handed to us.</p><p>And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations, does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.</p><p>And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between America First and America Only. They think that he's, you know, some nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not true.</p><p>But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the American President and thank God for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that China has been abusing --</p><p>HUCKABEE: Terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- has been the bad actor.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It's terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has been stealing IP.</p><p>Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with China at this point?</p><p>LEE: Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic breakthrough at this dinner. I would --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LEE: I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these tariffs down the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, I think you're right because --</p><p>LEE: -- and continue talking, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LEE: Yes. You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally, but that's short-term.</p><p>This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going away.</p><p>The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to open up markets and for peace and prosperity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.</p><p>You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY: Yes. I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.

Big tech continues to move into health care, it is raising fresh privacy concerns, though. Lauren Simonetti with all the details on that. Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.</p><p>The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this, you might appreciate what they're doing. Let me explain.</p><p>So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your health data, your medical records.</p><p>Why are they doing this? Well, they want to make money, health care is a $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first time.</p><p>And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you have software, and algorithms.</p><p>And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the limiting resource is time. So, that's where they can come in and help.</p><p>It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right patients and the right drug trials.</p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care. Here's Toby Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are now an Advisor to Google.</p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is spending the resources on healthcare expertise.</p><p>COSGROVE: You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or Amazon and Google as well.</p><p>Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a problem and, B, an opportunity.</p><p>The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is doubling every 73 days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's an incredibly stat.</p><p>COSGROVE: Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage all this data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine learning.</p><p>COSGROVE: Exactly. Well, on top of that, it also gives you interoperability.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMONETTI: So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going through you data in the first place with not getting hacked?</p><p>So this is the way we're moving, you know. You go to the doctor now, the doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an iPad. You see it all the time.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We're there.</p><p>Do we trust algorithms?</p><p>BARTIROMO: One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us, Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this vehicle, they can perform many of the things.</p><p>And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person, the more important.</p><p>So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it takes in the vehicle. It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit.</p><p>So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really life-saving.</p><p>It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I recognize that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person that she went to see for it missed it. She was stroking for about five days.</p><p>So, again, whatever it takes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. That's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- for these doctors.</p><p>And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even just the management of the drugs that you're taking. With my mom having stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the drugs that she has to take.</p><p>Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital, there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four years ago.</p><p>Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for particularly catastrophic illness.</p><p>And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech companies with the data? Why do we trust the government, governor?</p><p>Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of health information, why do we trust the government over big companies?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Who says we trust them? I don't trust any of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why I said that.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes over to our homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and listens to us. Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off because they are --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- exactly. So while there are risks in terms of privacy and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care outweigh it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I would trust Amazon and a big tech company.</p><p>Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all --</p><p>SIMONETTI: But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. I -- that's amazing that data is doubling every 73 days in health care. Lauren, thanks. Lauren Simonetti.</p><p>Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the company's plan to restart search engine operations in China. More of the fallout there.

We are two hours away from the second reading on the third quarter GDP. Analysts are expecting growth in the GDP of 3-1/2 percent.</p><p>We will have those numbers, in two hours' time, for you, and show you how it is impacting markets. Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65 points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent higher, right now.</p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points, fractional moves here.</p><p>Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p>Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that this morning.

The package would revive expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change savings and retirement-related provisions. Here's contributor from The Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk more on taxes.</p><p>Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this. We've been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months. What's your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done, in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p>TATE: Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's tax law.</p><p>It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts, permanent.</p><p>Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats would have to agree to it and come on board. But I've got to tell you, Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this. The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p>And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was put together without their input.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan. And as you say, Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not controversial at all. But again, I don't -- the Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you make better decisions with your money, number one. Number two, they are not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p>HUCKABEE: No, they're not. But this is something the Republicans could have and should have done. They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to come through. They've got the votes between now and January. And as Larry the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know this tax bill will get crushed, right? Is it going to be middle of December, is our last hope? I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p>TATE: Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic. A lot of this is about political optics, too. I mean, the Democrats do not want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law. They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing progress.</p><p>And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this package that the President has been talking about because in addition to making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do you know, Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be. It's one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget that they were elected by one 435th of the American population. The President was elected by the entire country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And why is he still there? He said he's stepping down, and yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p>So, we ask, why now? Why the subpoenas coming out now? I don't mean to change the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, you're right. And I think that was so inept, I have to say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner? And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that --</p><p>HUCKABEE: It's all about the money. It's who the donors are and how they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with obligations to all the donors.</p><p>He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, how about this, guys? President Obama attending the Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not only did I not get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way, was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about. In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p>TATE: Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents requested by Congress. His other attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton were dropped.</p><p>But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming from a former president. I mean, right now, we are at the point where leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs, you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p>We need rhetoric that brings people together. And by the way, I've been equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well. But, you know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TATE: He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against his political enemies from the IRS --</p><p>TATE: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go low, well, we're right there with you. President Trump speaking and communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us see who all these people are.</p><p>And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense. Again, they're all -- they're all the same, all of them.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because they were protected. Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an illegal server.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted, anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class throughout their administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>KELLY: Well, think about --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is such a good point.</p><p>KELLY: Strzok and Page too. I mean, that sets an example.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. You call it a matter, not an investigation. And that's exactly what he did, he called it a matter. Kristin, it's great to get your insights always, come back soon.</p><p>TATE: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there. Coming up, Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater. Then, Krispy Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time. Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial China search projects. Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: We have been talking about this for a while, Maria. Some workers at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in China. At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative; it's known as Project Dragonfly. They say it's a \"censored search engine for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\" The browser will allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten dozens of signatures in addition. Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are up less than one percent for the year.</p><p>Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia. More than 500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average monthly rainfall within just two hours. About a dozen people had to be rescued from their cars; they were trapped. And thousands of homes lost power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.</p><p>Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story. This is crazy. He spent almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to sail now from Holland to Israel. He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it only makes sense to take it to God's land. One problem: there's no motor in the ark. And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically. So, we'll see if he raises the money.</p><p>And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes! Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin candy. And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return. Looks like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside. A holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut. All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts. I apologize now, Maria. I failed you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that story, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Very sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters. Remember our ugly Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?</p><p>CASONE: So much fun. I saved mine, by the way. I'm ready to go for this year. It is coming back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There we are. Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are coming to you with our ugly sweaters there. Dagen, that was fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: I appreciate that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, I did. It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE). And I still have it. I've worn it multiple times --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually, I like your reindeer sweater. Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think mine had a nose on the --</p><p>HUCKABEE: I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Says who?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I don't need one for Christmas, there you go. So, don't get me one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas.</p><p>HUCKABEE: No, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron, how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a path toward healthy living. We'll tell you about the products next up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the details, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria, considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers. While Foster is not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team facility. Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent allegations against him. A lot of his former teammates who is are now with the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the decision to bring him on board.</p><p>Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service, joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.</p><p>Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball. Rob Manfred yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling operation. Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out, the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.</p><p>What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy Crawford, Lindsey Vonn? A health and wellness company that they have formed called Ladder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL: They say, you should do this alone.</p><p>LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA: That if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.</p><p>LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER: They say you should never ask for help.</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER: We say, there's strength in numbers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines. There's going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build the ladder to wellness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is it wellness or protein powders? I mean --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is protein powder wellness?</p><p>MAX: Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say. So, there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way. Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day, get off of your butt and get running. That's the ticket to health and wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner. Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did was terrible but let's do some gambling.</p><p>MAX: And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this morning, they have to get real on this.</p><p>KELLY: Pete Rose meet the deadline, though. Didn't he have only so many years he could be elected in?</p><p>MAX: You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader. (INAUDIBLE), did he bet against his own team? Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough already.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, you --</p><p>HUCKABEE: No, I just want to say amen. Amen and amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>MAX: Amen.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's why I like Jared.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hallelujah.</p><p>MAX: I like this guy too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good sports stories today, Jared. Thank you, Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115. Quick break and then enticing iPhones, Apple wants to you give you more, in fact, more money to trade in your outdated iPhone. Next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

How  are you?  Thank you so much.  Happy Wednesday, ladies.  We will see you in  a few minutes.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And good morning, everyone, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  We're happy you're here.  It is Wednesday, November 28th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump versus Fed Chairman Jay Powell.  The President lashing out  at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p> It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this  afternoon, 12:00 noon.  </p><p> Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on.  The focus on President Trump's working  dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.  </p><p> The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air. </p><p> And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  There's disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than the United States.  </p><p> We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and  others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  President Trump confirming that possibility.  We are looking at  the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p> Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at  futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent.   S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.  </p><p> We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning.   We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for  the third quarter.  </p><p> Markets are up ahead of that.  </p><p> Gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p> The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points.  The NASDAQ was up eight  points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point,  and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third  of a percent.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the action is mixed.  FT-100 pulling back a  fraction, but the CAC Quarante is up 21 points, and the DAX Index in  Germany up 28 points.  It's good enough for a quarter of a percent gain in  Germany.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, gains across the board, take a look at the best  performers there, Japan, Hong Kong, China, all up better than one percent  overnight.  </p><p> Cindy Hyde-Smith holds on, the republican beating democrat Mike Espy to  keep her Mississippi Senate seat, bringing the latest in that late results.  </p><p> Plus LeBron James looking beyond basketball.  Details on his new venture  with Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lindsey Vonn in wellness,  offering energy powders and supplements.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p> And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and former Arkansas Governor,  Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee.  </p><p> Great to see you this morning. </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be with you, Maria.  Thank  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Good morning. </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Good morning.  Hopefully, we get  the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's  anticipating that. </p><p> That's a great quarter. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That would be a good quarter. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  We need it.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the President going after  General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax  credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down  for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've  hit this threshold.  </p><p> So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't  have to do anything.  They just have to step back and not extend it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the subsidies go away on their own. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer.  Tesla  already hit it recently.  </p><p> General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so  gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say,  \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these  billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government  Motors.  I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm  done with them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wow.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.  </p><p> And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're  not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel  and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump  administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing  them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what  Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S.  has been for a long, long time. </p><p> KELLY:  That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to  corporations?  I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Nope.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers?  So.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  We shouldn't be.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well -- and there was the bailout. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's why this is such a particularly important story  because a few years ago -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- this is the company that was bailed out.  Got a lot on the  table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General  Motors. </p><p> KELLY:  Crony Capitalism.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point that out.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yup.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big number, yes, you're right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Exactly right, Kevin.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and  member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.  </p><p> Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former  Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.  </p><p> Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.  </p><p> Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  </p><p> Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us.  Dr. Mike is going to joining us  as well.  Lots to talk about there.  </p><p> But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again.  The  President continues his campaign against Powell.  President Trump  criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.  </p><p> In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and  layoffs at General Motors.  </p><p> The President says this.  \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my  selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm  just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're  doing.\"</p><p> This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will  be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime. </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth  Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee. </p><p> Michael, good to see you.  </p><p> MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH:  Good morning. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.  </p><p> LEE:  So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success  in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher. </p><p> And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for  forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to  your economy over time. </p><p> When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no  inflation.  We need higher interest rates in this country. </p><p> I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long  overdue.  </p><p> And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the  macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks. </p><p> The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and  Bank of America which loans they can and can't make. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> LEE:  Right?  It just -- it shouldn't work like that. </p><p> And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching  overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.  </p><p> So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the  regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.  </p><p> So, I think the President made right choice.  I think he's unhappy with the  reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe.  But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the  Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as  the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the  impact of these rate hikes.  </p><p> What do you think?  </p><p> KELLY:  Well -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you really need four rate hikes this is year? </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close  to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say  we need to get back to neutral. </p><p> And guess what?  Guess who would agree with me?  Candidate President --  Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said  interest rates were too low.  </p><p> And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're  barely at breakeven rates.  </p><p> If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is,  it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?  </p><p> You can even have negative real interest rates.  </p><p> So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington  Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the  fed because his exact quote was -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut.  My gut tells me  more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p> He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\"   Well, guess what?  President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated  by the fed.  </p><p> Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy,  and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> KELLY:  He didn't do any fiscal policies. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And not only that.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are  going higher?  </p><p> We were at negative.  We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We  got to get back to normal.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in  a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used  to that. </p><p> Let's talk about policy over personality.  That's -- we're all used to  this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good.  Good.  Good.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you  know what, that's who the American people elected, number one. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Good.  I like it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise.  People  automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead. </p><p> He's not being hot-headed about this.  He's a real estate developer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the  -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this  country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for  six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for  eight straight months.  </p><p> Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the  economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral?  Are we  in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a  world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in  the last 30 or 40 years?  </p><p> Eight percent mortgage?  I don't think that this economy can handle that,  so -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And I don't think that's normal.  Is that normal? </p><p> KELLY:  That's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that the -- </p><p> KELLY:  That's (INAUDIBLE) housing.  Housing isn't affordable in a lot of  these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't  have speculation in the housing market. </p><p> And that's what they're preventing. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p> KELLY:  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's a reason why mortgage  rates are going to -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's not their job.  Their job isn't to prevent speculation. </p><p> KELLY:  Their -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Their job isn't -- </p><p> KELLY:  Their job is to prevent runaway inflation. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Runaway inflation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that's what -- </p><p> KELLY:  And what happens when housing inflations go up?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where's the runaway inflation?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  But there's no -- there isn't.  </p><p> KELLY:  There's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's no inflation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's what my point is, is that -- </p><p> KELLY:  Inflation is picking up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not. </p><p> KELLY:  That's why they're raising rates.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not.  And it's actually very, very tame.  </p><p> KELLY:  What housing market are you looking at? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p> LEE:  I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the  interest rate. </p><p> As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was  cost rates were much higher than they are right now.  </p><p> Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're  not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is  available, rates can be much, much higher.  </p><p> So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage  and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.  </p><p> So, as rates move higher, okay?  And credit availability increases, which  it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I  believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LEE:  What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone  pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again.  That's  changing. </p><p> Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened  since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's  changing.</p><p> Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened  since the election has changed that, okay?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LEE:  It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine  moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.  </p><p> We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is  going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page  story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed  is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.  </p><p> It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to  perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of  inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the  markets.  </p><p> That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article.  But -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP  today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and  a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.  </p><p> Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike,  but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at  noon.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know you're going to be there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm going to be there.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read  on that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision  in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy  in general.  </p><p> Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up  this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.  </p><p> The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi  Jinping.  </p><p> National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible  breakthrough in the trade talks. </p><p> He said this yesterday. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KUDLOW:  The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a  deal and he is open to it.  </p><p> But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago  are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's  perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here  actually? </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with  China.  </p><p> But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.  </p><p> I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but  to everybody.  </p><p> And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're  used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach  has gotten our heads handed to us.  </p><p> And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations,  does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.  </p><p> And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between  America First and America Only.  They think that he's, you know, some  nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not  true.  </p><p> But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the  American President and thank God for it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that  China has been abusing -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Terrible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- has been the bad actor.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  It's terrible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has been stealing IP.  </p><p> Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with  China at this point? </p><p> LEE:  Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic  breakthrough at this dinner.  I would -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> LEE:  I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these  tariffs down the road.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I think you're right because -- </p><p> LEE:  -- and continue talking, but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> LEE:  Yes.  You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally,  but that's short-term.  </p><p> This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going  away.  </p><p> The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to  open up markets and for peace and prosperity. </p><p> BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.  </p><p> You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and  they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.   There's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meaning they want to be number one in all the important  industries. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, including military.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Michael, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> LEE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael Lee there.

CINDY HYDE-SMITH (R), MISSISSIPPI:  Thank you so much for everything,  for the opportunities, for coming to Mississippi yesterday, two stops,  phenomenal. </p><p> Tupelo was unbelievable, the Coast was unbelievable.  We got to ride  together and I sure appreciated the time that he gave me. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  President Trump tweeting, \"Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde- Smith on your big win in the Great State of Mississippi.  We are all very  proud of you.\"  </p><p> With her win, the GOP has expanded its Senate majority now to 53 seats.  </p><p> Well, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Defense, James  Mattis, going to be brief Senators today on Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> Lawmakers are pressing the administration on its relationship with the  country amid its involvement in the war in Yemen, and the death of  journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p> Notably absent from the meeting is going to be CIA Director, Gina Haspel,  the only one of the three reported to have listened to the audio that  allegedly depicts the killing of Khashoggi.  And several senators are  calling for her to appear.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Pompeo wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" stressing the  importance of the Saudi-U.S. relationship, calling it a powerful force for  stability in the Middle East.  </p><p> Maria recently spoke with Prince bin -- Al-Waleed bin Talal. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A month ago, a brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, where his body  was dismembered, is Mohammed bin Salman for real or is he lying to us about  this modernization plan? </p><p> AL-WALEED BIN TALAL, PRINCE SAUDI:  As for the Jamal Khashoggi incident,  you know, you have to understand, Jamal was not only my friend, he was  working with me.  </p><p> Actually, his last job in Saudi Arabia was me and the Arab Channel.  </p><p> And I like to give through you my condolences, again, to his family, to his  wife, ex-wife, and to his children, and to his family because Jamal was a  reformer.  He was no opposition at all.  </p><p> And what took place in that Saudi Consulate was clearly horrific -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> BIN TALAL: -- despicable, and tragic and I believe that Saudi Arabia is  going to get to the bottom of it, but, please, you have to give us some  time until the investigation is done and made public by the Government of  Saudi Arabia. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CASONE:  All right.

Big tech continues to move into health care, it  is raising fresh privacy concerns, though.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details on that.  Lauren, good morning. </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p> The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this,  you might appreciate what they're doing.  Let me explain.  </p><p> So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your  health data, your medical records.  </p><p> Why are they doing this?  Well, they want to make money, health care is a  $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save  money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first  time. </p><p> And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their  press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you  have software, and algorithms.  </p><p> And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical  text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the  limiting resource is time.  So, that's where they can come in and help.  </p><p> It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right  patients and the right drug trials.  </p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care.  Here's Toby  Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You are now an Advisor to Google.  </p><p> TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is  spending the resources on healthcare expertise. </p><p> COSGROVE:  You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the  high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether  watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or  Amazon and Google as well. </p><p> Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a  problem and, B, an opportunity.  </p><p> The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is  doubling every 73 days.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's an incredibly stat.  </p><p> COSGROVE:  Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage  all this data. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data  being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine  learning. </p><p> COSGROVE:  Exactly.  Well, on top of that, it also gives you  interoperability. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going  through you data in the first place with not getting hacked? </p><p> So this is the way we're moving, you know.  You go to the doctor now, the  doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an  iPad.  You see it all the time.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  We're there. </p><p> Do we trust algorithms? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us,  Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has  a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this  vehicle, they can perform many of the things.  </p><p> And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person,  the more important.  </p><p> So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it  takes in the vehicle.  It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit. </p><p> So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really  life-saving.  </p><p> It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I  recognize that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person  that she went to see for it missed it.  She was stroking for about five  days. </p><p> So, again, whatever it takes -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- for these doctors.  </p><p> And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even  just the management of the drugs that you're taking.  With my mom having  stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the  drugs that she has to take.  </p><p> Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital,  there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four  years ago.  </p><p> Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for  particularly catastrophic illness.  </p><p> And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech  companies with the data?  Why do we trust the government, governor?  </p><p> Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of  health information, why do we trust the government over big companies? </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Who says we trust them?  I don't trust any of them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's why I said that. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach  company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer  living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes  over to our homes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and  listens to us.  Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off  because they are -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So -- exactly.  So while there are risks in terms of privacy  and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the  positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care  outweigh it? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I  would trust Amazon and a big tech company.  </p><p> Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands  of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting  digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple  would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then  say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong  address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been  performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon  basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  I -- that's amazing that  data is doubling every 73 days in health care.  Lauren, thanks.  Lauren  Simonetti.  </p><p> Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the  company's plan to restart search engine operations in China.  More of the  fallout there.  Big debate around this. </p><p> And then life-sized art, one Dutch carpenter is undertaking to create and  sail a true to life version of Noah's Ark, we've got it next, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November  28th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> The President versus the Federal Reserve, President Trump slamming Jay  Powell, again, ahead of the Fed chairman's speech today, telling the  Washington Post yesterday, that h is not, at all, happy with Powell.</p><p> Fox Business will bring you that speech live, at noontime today, stay with  us, and you'll hear what Jay Powell has to say about where we are on the  economy, right now.  We are two hours away from the second reading on the  third quarter GDP.  Analysts are expecting growth in the GDP of 3-1/2  percent.</p><p> We will have those numbers, in two hours' time, for you, and show you how  it is impacting markets.  Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the  start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65  points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent  higher, right now.</p><p> This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials  picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the  S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p> In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very  much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up  eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points,  fractional moves here.</p><p> Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent  in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p> Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go  ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that  this morning.  Plus -- this, ahead of President Trump's upcoming meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, later  this week.</p><p> Plus, extreme weather, Sidney, Australia, hit by its average monthly  rainfall over the course of two hours.</p><p> And a new venture, LeBron James teams up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Cindy Crawford, for wellness.</p><p> All those stories coming up, this Wednesday morning, but first, this top  story, this half an hour, partisan divide over more tax cuts, House  Republicans now having a new tax package, facing opposition from Democrats,  who say they were blindsided by this proposal.</p><p> The House GOP unveiling their new round of tax cuts, this week, hoping to  pass it during Congress' Lame-Duck Session.  The package would revive  expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change  savings and retirement-related provisions.  Here's contributor from The  Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk  more on taxes.</p><p> Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this.  We've  been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months.  What's  your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done,  in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p> TATE:  Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety  of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and  the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you  mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of  disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's  tax law.</p><p> It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that  the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats  objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts,  permanent.</p><p> Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats  would have to agree to it and come on board.  But I've got to tell you,  Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this.   The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p> And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial  stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was  put together without their input.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time  around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan.  And as you say,  Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking  about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's not controversial at all.  But again, I don't -- the  Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you  make better decisions with your money, number one.  Number two, they are  not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, they're not.  But this is something the Republicans could  have and should have done.  They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to  come through.  They've got the votes between now and January.  And as Larry  the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know  this tax bill will get crushed, right?  Is it going to be middle of  December, is our last hope?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out  because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p> TATE:  Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has  a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic.  A  lot of this is about political optics, too.  I mean, the Democrats do not  want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law.   They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing  progress.</p><p> And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating  over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear  what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this  package that the President has been talking about because in addition to  making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants  to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do  you know, Governor?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be.  It's  one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but  unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is  never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget  that they were elected by one 435th of the American population.  The  President was elected by the entire country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's too bad.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And why is he still there?  He said he's stepping down, and  yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas  that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a  year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p> So, we ask, why now?  Why the subpoenas coming out now?  I don't mean to  change the subject.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  And I think that was so inept, I have to  say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta  Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner?   And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  It's all about the money.  It's who the donors are and how  they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has  been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with  obligations to all the donors.</p><p> He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental  difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more  effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  President Obama attending the  Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president  took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only did I not  get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way,  was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about.   In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to  get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p> TATE:  Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney  general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn  over documents requested by Congress.  His other attorney general, Loretta  Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill  Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton  were dropped.</p><p> But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time  right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming  from a former president.  I mean, right now, we are at the point where  leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs,  you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and  Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p> We need rhetoric that brings people together.  And by the way, I've been  equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well.  But, you  know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> TATE:  He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against  his political enemies from the IRS -- </p><p> TATE:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that  we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go  low, well, we're right there with you.  President Trump speaking and  communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us  see who all these people are.</p><p> And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make  jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense.  Again, they're all --  they're all the same, all of them.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in  particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because  they were protected.  Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an  illegal server.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I  think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted,  anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class  throughout their administration.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for  Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> KELLY:  Well, think about -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is such a good point.</p><p> KELLY:  Strzok and Page too.  I mean, that sets an example.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  You call it a matter, not an investigation.  And that's  exactly what he did, he called it a matter.  Kristin, it's great to get  your insights always, come back soon.</p><p> TATE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there.  Coming up,  Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the  torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater.  Then, Krispy  Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which  features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time.   Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial  China search projects.  Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  We have been talking about this for a while, Maria.  Some workers  at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in  China.  At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers  published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative;  it's known as Project Dragonfly.  They say it's a \"censored search engine  for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\"  The browser will  allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten  dozens of signatures in addition.  Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are  up less than one percent for the year.</p><p> Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia.  More than  500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average  monthly rainfall within just two hours.  About a dozen people had to be  rescued from their cars; they were trapped.  And thousands of homes lost  power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.  </p><p> Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size  Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story.  This is crazy.  He spent  almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to  sail now from Holland to Israel.  He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it  only makes sense to take it to God's land.  One problem: there's no motor  in the ark.  And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can  rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically.  So,  we'll see if he raises the money.  </p><p> And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this  year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes!   Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin  candy.  And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return.  Looks  like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside.  A  holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut.   All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts.  I apologize  now, Maria.  I failed you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that  story, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Very sorry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters.  Remember our ugly  Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  </p><p> CASONE:  So much fun.  I saved mine, by the way.  I'm ready to go for this  year.  It is coming back.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There we are.  Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are  coming to you with our ugly sweaters there.  Dagen, that was fun.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered  yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them  delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  I appreciate that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I did.  It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE).  And I still have it.   I've worn it multiple times --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually, I like your reindeer sweater.  Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think mine had a nose on the --  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Says who?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I don't need one for Christmas, there you go.  So, don't get me  one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, thanks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron,  how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a  path toward healthy living.  We'll tell you about the products next up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and  charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the  details, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria,  considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and  all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were  shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington  Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers.  While Foster is  not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team  facility.  Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent  allegations against him.  A lot of his former teammates who is are now with  the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the  decision to bring him on board.  </p><p> Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service,  joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of  live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.  </p><p> Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose  reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball.  Rob Manfred  yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling  operation.  Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM  Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly  suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out,  the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.  </p><p> What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy  Crawford, Lindsey Vonn?  A health and wellness company that they have  formed called Ladder. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL:  They say, you should do this alone.  </p><p> LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  That if you want  something done right, you have to do it yourself.  </p><p> LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER:  They say you should never ask for  help.  </p><p> ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER:  We say, there's strength in  numbers.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these  four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines.  There's  going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're  going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build  the ladder to wellness.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it wellness or protein powders?  I mean --</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is protein powder wellness?  </p><p> MAX:  Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say.  So,  there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way.   Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day,  get off of your butt and get running.  That's the ticket to health and  wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner.   Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did  was terrible but let's do some gambling.  </p><p> MAX:  And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of  fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this  morning, they have to get real on this.  </p><p> KELLY:  Pete Rose meet the deadline, though.  Didn't he have only so many  years he could be elected in?  </p><p> MAX:  You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader.  (INAUDIBLE),  did he bet against his own team?  Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough  already.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, you --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, I just want to say amen.  Amen and amen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> MAX:  Amen.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's why I like Jared.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah.</p><p> MAX:  I like this guy too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good sports stories today, Jared.  Thank you, Jared Max.  Catch  Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.   Quick break and then enticing iPhones, Apple wants to you give you more, in  fact, more money to trade in your outdated iPhone.  Next hour right here in  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

The President lashing out  at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p>It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this  afternoon, 12:00 noon.  </p><p>Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on.  The focus on President Trump's working  dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.  </p><p>The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air. </p><p>And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  There's disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than the United States.  </p><p>We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and  others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump confirming that possibility.  We are looking at  the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at  futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent.   S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.  </p><p>We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning.   We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for  the third quarter.  </p><p>Markets are up ahead of that.  </p><p>Gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p>The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points.  The NASDAQ was up eight  points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point,  and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third  of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the action is mixed.

Details on his new venture  with Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Lindsey Vonn in wellness,  offering energy powders and supplements.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly, and former Arkansas Governor,  Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee.  </p><p>Great to see you this morning. </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be with you, Maria.  Thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Good morning. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Good morning.  Hopefully, we get  the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's  anticipating that. </p><p>That's a great quarter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be a good quarter. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  We need it.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the President going after  General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax  credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down  for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've  hit this threshold.  </p><p>So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't  have to do anything.  They just have to step back and not extend it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the subsidies go away on their own. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer.  Tesla  already hit it recently.  </p><p>General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so  gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say,  \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these  billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government  Motors.  I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm  done with them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.  </p><p>And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're  not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel  and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump  administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing  them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what  Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S.  has been for a long, long time. </p><p>KELLY:  That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to  corporations?  I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Nope.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers?  So.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  We shouldn't be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- and there was the bailout. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why this is such a particularly important story  because a few years ago -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is the company that was bailed out.  Got a lot on the  table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General  Motors. </p><p>KELLY:  Crony Capitalism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point that out.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yup.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big number, yes, you're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Exactly right, Kevin.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and  member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.  </p><p>Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former  Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.  </p><p>Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.  </p><p>Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  </p><p>Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us.  Dr. Mike is going to joining us  as well.  Lots to talk about there.  </p><p>But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again.  The  President continues his campaign against Powell.  President Trump  criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.  </p><p>In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and  layoffs at General Motors.  </p><p>The President says this.  \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my  selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm  just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're  doing.\"</p><p>This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will  be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth  Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee. </p><p>Michael, good to see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH:  Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.  </p><p>LEE:  So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success  in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher. </p><p>And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for  forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to  your economy over time. </p><p>When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no  inflation.  We need higher interest rates in this country. </p><p>I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long  overdue.  </p><p>And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the  macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks. </p><p>The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and  Bank of America which loans they can and can't make. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>LEE:  Right?  It just -- it shouldn't work like that. </p><p>And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching  overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.  </p><p>So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the  regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.  </p><p>So, I think the President made right choice.  I think he's unhappy with the  reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe.  But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the  Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as  the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the  impact of these rate hikes.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>KELLY:  Well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you really need four rate hikes this is year? </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close  to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say  we need to get back to neutral. </p><p>And guess what?  Guess who would agree with me?  Candidate President --  Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said  interest rates were too low.  </p><p>And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're  barely at breakeven rates.  </p><p>If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is,  it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?  </p><p>You can even have negative real interest rates.  </p><p>So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington  Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the  fed because his exact quote was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut.  My gut tells me  more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p>He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\"   Well, guess what?  President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated  by the fed.  </p><p>Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy,  and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't do any fiscal policies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are  going higher?  </p><p>We were at negative.  We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We  got to get back to normal.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in  a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used  to that. </p><p>Let's talk about policy over personality.  That's -- we're all used to  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  Good.  Good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you  know what, that's who the American people elected, number one. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Good.  I like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise.  People  automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead. </p><p>He's not being hot-headed about this.  He's a real estate developer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the  -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this  country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for  six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for  eight straight months.  </p><p>Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the  economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral?  Are we  in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a  world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in  the last 30 or 40 years?  </p><p>Eight percent mortgage?  I don't think that this economy can handle that,  so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And I don't think that's normal.  Is that normal? </p><p>KELLY:  That's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that the -- </p><p>KELLY:  That's (INAUDIBLE) housing.  Housing isn't affordable in a lot of  these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't  have speculation in the housing market. </p><p>And that's what they're preventing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's a reason why mortgage  rates are going to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not their job.  Their job isn't to prevent speculation. </p><p>KELLY:  Their -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Their job isn't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Their job is to prevent runaway inflation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Runaway inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what -- </p><p>KELLY:  And what happens when housing inflations go up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the runaway inflation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But there's no -- there isn't.  </p><p>KELLY:  There's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's no inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what my point is, is that -- </p><p>KELLY:  Inflation is picking up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not. </p><p>KELLY:  That's why they're raising rates.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not.  And it's actually very, very tame.  </p><p>KELLY:  What housing market are you looking at? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p>LEE:  I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the  interest rate. </p><p>As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was  cost rates were much higher than they are right now.  </p><p>Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're  not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is  available, rates can be much, much higher.  </p><p>So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage  and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.  </p><p>So, as rates move higher, okay?  And credit availability increases, which  it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I  believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone  pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again.  That's  changing. </p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened  since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's  changing.</p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened  since the election has changed that, okay?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine  moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.  </p><p>We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is  going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page  story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed  is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.  </p><p>It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to  perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of  inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the  markets.  </p><p>That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article.  But -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP  today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and  a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.  </p><p>Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike,  but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at  noon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know you're going to be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to be there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read  on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision  in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy  in general.  </p><p>Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up  this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.  </p><p>The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi  Jinping.  </p><p>National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible  breakthrough in the trade talks. </p><p>He said this yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a  deal and he is open to it.  </p><p>But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago  are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's  perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here  actually? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with  China.  </p><p>But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.  </p><p>I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but  to everybody.  </p><p>And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're  used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach  has gotten our heads handed to us.  </p><p>And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations,  does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.  </p><p>And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between  America First and America Only.  They think that he's, you know, some  nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not  true.  </p><p>But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the  American President and thank God for it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that  China has been abusing -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- has been the bad actor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has been stealing IP.  </p><p>Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with  China at this point? </p><p>LEE:  Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic  breakthrough at this dinner.  I would -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LEE:  I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these  tariffs down the road.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I think you're right because -- </p><p>LEE:  -- and continue talking, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>LEE:  Yes.  You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally,  but that's short-term.  </p><p>This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going  away.  </p><p>The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to  open up markets and for peace and prosperity. </p><p>BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.  </p><p>You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and  they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.   There's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning they want to be number one in all the important  industries. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, including military.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Michael, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>LEE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael Lee there.  Count-up, Mississippi has voted, a big win  for President Trump as Cindy Hyde-Smith becomes first Female Senator  elected in the Magnolia State.  </p><p>Then climbing the ladder, how celebrities like LeBron James are teaming up  to create their very own wellness brands of protein powders and supplements  coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Cindy Hyde-Smith first woman ever elected to Congress from Mississippi.

He was no opposition at all.  </p><p>And what took place in that Saudi Consulate was clearly horrific -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>BIN TALAL: -- despicable, and tragic and I believe that Saudi Arabia is  going to get to the bottom of it, but, please, you have to give us some  time until the investigation is done and made public by the Government of  Saudi Arabia. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.

Big tech continues to move into health care, it  is raising fresh privacy concerns, though.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details on that.  Lauren, good morning. </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this,  you might appreciate what they're doing.  Let me explain.  </p><p>So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your  health data, your medical records.  </p><p>Why are they doing this?  Well, they want to make money, health care is a  $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save  money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first  time. </p><p>And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their  press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you  have software, and algorithms.  </p><p>And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical  text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the  limiting resource is time.  So, that's where they can come in and help.  </p><p>It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right  patients and the right drug trials.  </p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care.  Here's Toby  Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are now an Advisor to Google.  </p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is  spending the resources on healthcare expertise. </p><p>COSGROVE:  You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the  high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether  watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or  Amazon and Google as well. </p><p>Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a  problem and, B, an opportunity.  </p><p>The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is  doubling every 73 days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an incredibly stat.  </p><p>COSGROVE:  Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage  all this data. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data  being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine  learning. </p><p>COSGROVE:  Exactly.  Well, on top of that, it also gives you  interoperability. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going  through you data in the first place with not getting hacked? </p><p>So this is the way we're moving, you know.  You go to the doctor now, the  doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an  iPad.  You see it all the time.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We're there. </p><p>Do we trust algorithms? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us,  Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has  a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this  vehicle, they can perform many of the things.  </p><p>And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person,  the more important.  </p><p>So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it  takes in the vehicle.  It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit. </p><p>So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really  life-saving.  </p><p>It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I  recognize that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person  that she went to see for it missed it.  She was stroking for about five  days. </p><p>So, again, whatever it takes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for these doctors.  </p><p>And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even  just the management of the drugs that you're taking.  With my mom having  stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the  drugs that she has to take.  </p><p>Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital,  there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four  years ago.  </p><p>Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for  particularly catastrophic illness.  </p><p>And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech  companies with the data?  Why do we trust the government, governor?  </p><p>Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of  health information, why do we trust the government over big companies? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who says we trust them?  I don't trust any of them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why I said that. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach  company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer  living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes  over to our homes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and  listens to us.  Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off  because they are -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So -- exactly.  So while there are risks in terms of privacy  and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the  positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care  outweigh it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I  would trust Amazon and a big tech company.  </p><p>Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands  of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting  digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple  would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then  say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong  address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been  performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon  basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  I -- that's amazing that  data is doubling every 73 days in health care.  Lauren, thanks.  Lauren  Simonetti.  </p><p>Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the  company's plan to restart search engine operations in China.  More of the  fallout there.  Big debate around this. </p><p>And then life-sized art, one Dutch carpenter is undertaking to create and  sail a true to life version of Noah's Ark, we've got it next, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November  28th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The President versus the Federal Reserve, President Trump slamming Jay  Powell, again, ahead of the Fed chairman's speech today, telling the  Washington Post yesterday, that h is not, at all, happy with Powell.</p><p>Fox Business will bring you that speech live, at noontime today, stay with  us, and you'll hear what Jay Powell has to say about where we are on the  economy, right now.  We are two hours away from the second reading on the  third quarter GDP.  Analysts are expecting growth in the GDP of 3-1/2  percent.</p><p>We will have those numbers, in two hours' time, for you, and show you how  it is impacting markets.  Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the  start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65  points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent  higher, right now.</p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials  picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the  S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very  much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up  eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points,  fractional moves here.</p><p>Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent  in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p>Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go  ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that  this morning.  Plus -- this, ahead of President Trump's upcoming meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, later  this week.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather, Sidney, Australia, hit by its average monthly  rainfall over the course of two hours.</p><p>And a new venture, LeBron James teams up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Cindy Crawford, for wellness.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Wednesday morning, but first, this top  story, this half an hour, partisan divide over more tax cuts, House  Republicans now having a new tax package, facing opposition from Democrats,  who say they were blindsided by this proposal.</p><p>The House GOP unveiling their new round of tax cuts, this week, hoping to  pass it during Congress' Lame-Duck Session.  The package would revive  expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change  savings and retirement-related provisions.  Here's contributor from The  Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk  more on taxes.</p><p>Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this.  We've  been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months.  What's  your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done,  in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p>TATE:  Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety  of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and  the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you  mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of  disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's  tax law.</p><p>It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that  the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats  objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts,  permanent.</p><p>Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats  would have to agree to it and come on board.  But I've got to tell you,  Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this.   The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p>And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial  stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was  put together without their input.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time  around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan.  And as you say,  Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking  about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not controversial at all.  But again, I don't -- the  Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you  make better decisions with your money, number one.  Number two, they are  not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, they're not.  But this is something the Republicans could  have and should have done.  They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to  come through.  They've got the votes between now and January.  And as Larry  the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know  this tax bill will get crushed, right?  Is it going to be middle of  December, is our last hope?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out  because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p>TATE:  Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has  a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic.  A  lot of this is about political optics, too.  I mean, the Democrats do not  want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law.   They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing  progress.</p><p>And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating  over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear  what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this  package that the President has been talking about because in addition to  making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants  to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do  you know, Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be.  It's  one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but  unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is  never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget  that they were elected by one 435th of the American population.  The  President was elected by the entire country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why is he still there?  He said he's stepping down, and  yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas  that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a  year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p>So, we ask, why now?  Why the subpoenas coming out now?  I don't mean to  change the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  And I think that was so inept, I have to  say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta  Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner?   And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's all about the money.  It's who the donors are and how  they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has  been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with  obligations to all the donors.</p><p>He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental  difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more  effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  President Obama attending the  Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president  took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only did I not  get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way,  was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about.   In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to  get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p>TATE:  Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney  general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn  over documents requested by Congress.  His other attorney general, Loretta  Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill  Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton  were dropped.</p><p>But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time  right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming  from a former president.  I mean, right now, we are at the point where  leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs,  you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and  Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p>We need rhetoric that brings people together.  And by the way, I've been  equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well.  But, you  know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TATE:  He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against  his political enemies from the IRS -- </p><p>TATE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that  we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go  low, well, we're right there with you.  President Trump speaking and  communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us  see who all these people are.</p><p>And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make  jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense.  Again, they're all --  they're all the same, all of them.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in  particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because  they were protected.  Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an  illegal server.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I  think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted,  anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class  throughout their administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for  Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, think about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is such a good point.</p><p>KELLY:  Strzok and Page too.  I mean, that sets an example.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You call it a matter, not an investigation.  And that's  exactly what he did, he called it a matter.  Kristin, it's great to get  your insights always, come back soon.</p><p>TATE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there.  Coming up,  Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the  torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater.  Then, Krispy  Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which  features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time.   Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial  China search projects.  Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  We have been talking about this for a while, Maria.  Some workers  at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in  China.  At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers  published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative;  it's known as Project Dragonfly.  They say it's a \"censored search engine  for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\"  The browser will  allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten  dozens of signatures in addition.  Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are  up less than one percent for the year.</p><p>Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia.  More than  500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average  monthly rainfall within just two hours.  About a dozen people had to be  rescued from their cars; they were trapped.  And thousands of homes lost  power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.  </p><p>Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size  Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story.  This is crazy.  He spent  almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to  sail now from Holland to Israel.  He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it  only makes sense to take it to God's land.  One problem: there's no motor  in the ark.  And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can  rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically.  So,  we'll see if he raises the money.  </p><p>And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this  year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes!   Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin  candy.  And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return.  Looks  like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside.  A  holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut.   All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts.  I apologize  now, Maria.  I failed you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that  story, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Very sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters.  Remember our ugly  Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  </p><p>CASONE:  So much fun.  I saved mine, by the way.  I'm ready to go for this  year.  It is coming back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There we are.  Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are  coming to you with our ugly sweaters there.  Dagen, that was fun.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered  yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them  delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  I appreciate that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I did.  It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE).  And I still have it.   I've worn it multiple times --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, I like your reindeer sweater.  Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think mine had a nose on the --  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Says who?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't need one for Christmas, there you go.  So, don't get me  one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron,  how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a  path toward healthy living.  We'll tell you about the products next up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and  charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the  details, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria,  considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and  all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were  shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington  Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers.  While Foster is  not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team  facility.  Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent  allegations against him.  A lot of his former teammates who is are now with  the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the  decision to bring him on board.  </p><p>Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service,  joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of  live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.  </p><p>Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose  reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball.  Rob Manfred  yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling  operation.  Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM  Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly  suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out,  the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.  </p><p>What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy  Crawford, Lindsey Vonn?  A health and wellness company that they have  formed called Ladder. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL:  They say, you should do this alone.  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  That if you want  something done right, you have to do it yourself.  </p><p>LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER:  They say you should never ask for  help.  </p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER:  We say, there's strength in  numbers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these  four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines.  There's  going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're  going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build  the ladder to wellness.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it wellness or protein powders?  I mean --</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is protein powder wellness?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say.  So,  there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way.   Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day,  get off of your butt and get running.  That's the ticket to health and  wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner.   Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did  was terrible but let's do some gambling.  </p><p>MAX:  And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of  fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this  morning, they have to get real on this.  </p><p>KELLY:  Pete Rose meet the deadline, though.  Didn't he have only so many  years he could be elected in?  </p><p>MAX:  You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader.  (INAUDIBLE),  did he bet against his own team?  Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough  already.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, you --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, I just want to say amen.  Amen and amen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  Amen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's why I like Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah.</p><p>MAX:  I like this guy too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good sports stories today, Jared.

It is Wednesday, November 28th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump versus Fed Chairman Jay Powell.  The President lashing out  at Powell again in a new interview with The Washington Post.</p><p>It comes ahead of a highly-anticipated speech today from Jay Powell this  afternoon, 12:00 noon.  </p><p>Meanwhile, G-20 countdown is on.  The focus on President Trump's working  dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday.  </p><p>The question is whether they make a deal on trade is still up in the air. </p><p>And then there's this, a new threat for General Motors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  There's disappointment  that it seems like G.M. would rather build its electric cars in China  rather than the United States.  </p><p>We are going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and  others, whether they should apply or not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump confirming that possibility.  We are looking at  the fallout of taking away those subsidies.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors showing signs of optimism this morning, take a look at  futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now, that's a third of a percent.   S&amp;P is also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 28 points.  </p><p>We are getting the second reading on the third quarter GDP this morning.   We are expecting to show growth of three and a half percent for the GDP for  the third quarter.  </p><p>Markets are up ahead of that.  </p><p>Gains across the board yesterday as well.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p>The Dow at the close yesterday up 108 points.  The NASDAQ was up eight  points and the -- I'm sorry, the NASDAQ was up a fraction under one point,  and the S&amp;P 500 was up eight points yesterday at the close, about a third  of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the action is mixed.  FT-100 pulling back a  fraction, but the CAC Quarante is up 21 points, and the DAX Index in  Germany up 28 points.

Thank  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Good morning. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Good morning.  Hopefully, we get  the confirmation of 3.5 percent on the GDP print, so the market's  anticipating that. </p><p>That's a great quarter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be a good quarter. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  We need it.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the President going after  General Motors, threatening to take away subsidies, here's the headline.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President doesn't have to do anything because that tax  credit, it's $7,500 per vehicle, it's going -- it's basically winding down  for General Motors in literally the next couple of months because they've  hit this threshold.  </p><p>So, it starts to disappear -- gradually expire so the White House wouldn't  have to do anything.  They just have to step back and not extend it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the subsidies go away on their own. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  After you hit a 200,000 vehicle mark per manufacturer.  Tesla  already hit it recently.  </p><p>General Motors will is going to hit in the next couple of months so  gradually expires, this $7,500 tax credit so they can just step and say,  \"You don't get any more subsidies.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But how tone-deaf is G.M. on all this? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Closing plants right here at Christmas time, they get all these  billions of dollars of subsidies from the taxpayers to become Government  Motors.  I resented it then, I'd been a 35-year G.M. customer, I said I'm  done with them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I haven't had a G.M. product since, won't have another one.  </p><p>And, you know, then they pull this stunt and I just feel like that they're  not thinking very smartly in terms of how they're presenting their company  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- and ingratitude to the American taxpayer. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  White House, the Trump administration could rescind the steel  and aluminum tariffs that would save 9,400 jobs, how about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, fine, but you know what, it's the pressure that the Trump  administration is putting on these countries in the tariffs that's causing  them to get to the point where I hope we have zero tariffs which is what  Kudlow wants, which is what the President wants.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't get there by being a chump which is what is U.S.  has been for a long, long time. </p><p>KELLY:  That's a great point, why don't we get rid of all subsidies to  corporations?  I'm not getting a subsidy, you're not getting a subsidy -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Nope.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- why are we playing favorites with automobile manufacturers?  So.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  We shouldn't be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- and there was the bailout. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why this is such a particularly important story  because a few years ago -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is the company that was bailed out.  Got a lot on the  table, G.M. -- go ahead, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we lost $11.2 billion on that bailout just for General  Motors. </p><p>KELLY:  Crony Capitalism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point that out.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yup.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big number, yes, you're right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Exactly right, Kevin.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman and  member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess is here.  </p><p>Congressman Burgess will be joining us this morning, along with Former  Chief Economic Adviser under George w. Bush, Ed Lazear, is here.  </p><p>Rooted Management Co-Chairman and CEO, Bill Rubin, is with us this morning.  </p><p>Talking about real estate and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  </p><p>Plus Dr. Mikhail Varshavski back with us.  Dr. Mike is going to joining us  as well.  Lots to talk about there.  </p><p>But we got to first talk about Jay Powell, under pressure once again.  The  President continues his campaign against Powell.  President Trump  criticized the Federal Reserve Chairman yet again yesterday.  </p><p>In an interview with the post, blaming Powell for the secret declines and  layoffs at General Motors.  </p><p>The President says this.  \"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my  selection of Jay, not even a little bit and I'm not blaming anybody, I'm  just telling you I think that the fed is way off base with what they're  doing.\"</p><p>This comes ahead of Powell's key speech today on monetary policy, he will  be speaking to the New York Economic Club today at noontime. </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Altium Wealth  Portfolio Manager, Market Strategist, Michael Lee. </p><p>Michael, good to see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH:  Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's comments about Jay Powell.  </p><p>LEE:  So it -- the President is a little bit of a victim of his own success  in that the economy is taking off so interest rates have to go higher. </p><p>And I think people have grown too attached to this zero interest rates for  forever and they don't look at Japan and the destruction that it causes to  your economy over time. </p><p>When you have zero interest rates, it's because you have no growth and no  inflation.  We need higher interest rates in this country. </p><p>I think the fed is being extremely smart and normalizing, I think it's long  overdue.  </p><p>And I think the reason that Powell is there is more to work on the  macroprudential, or the regulatory environment of the big banks. </p><p>The Federal Reserve should not be telling J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo, and  Bank of America which loans they can and can't make. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>LEE:  Right?  It just -- it shouldn't work like that. </p><p>And when they do it, when they -- when they have this overreaching  overregulation, it slows down the entire economy.  </p><p>So, Powell is there as a banker and an attorney to help move back the  regulatory state, more so than a classically trained economist.  </p><p>So, I think the President made right choice.  I think he's unhappy with the  reality that rates have to go higher as are a lot of people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe.  But, you know, a lot of people also do feel that the  Federal Reserve may be going one step too far, not that they are loco, as  the President have said, but that maybe you want to wait to assess the  impact of these rate hikes.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>KELLY:  Well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you really need four rate hikes this is year? </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, you do, because even Chairman Powell said we're not even close  to neutral, and that's being confirmed by other fed governors, so they say  we need to get back to neutral. </p><p>And guess what?  Guess who would agree with me?  Candidate President --  Candidate Trump, not President Trump, but candidate, because he even said  interest rates were too low.  </p><p>And the problem is we're getting a 3.5 percent GDP print now and we're  barely at breakeven rates.  </p><p>If you look at inflation and then you look at where the fed funds rate is,  it's barely -- it's barely even there, right?  </p><p>You can even have negative real interest rates.  </p><p>So the problem I have with President Trump and what he told \"The Washington  Post\" is he said his gut is stronger than the collective brainpower of the  fed because his exact quote was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut.  My gut tells me  more than some -- sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p>He also said, \"I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the fed.\"   Well, guess what?  President Trump, you're not supposed to be accommodated  by the fed.  </p><p>Listen, that's not -- monetary policy is theirs, yours is fiscal policy,  and this is the exact problem we had with President Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't do any fiscal policies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Dagen, how are we supposed to be surprised that rates are  going higher?  </p><p>We were at negative.  We were at zero for a decade and everybody said, \"We  got to get back to normal.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I will argue this, like, I'm not going to get my trousers in  a twist over President Trump lambasting, say, Jay Powell, we've gotten used  to that. </p><p>Let's talk about policy over personality.  That's -- we're all used to  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  Good.  Good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest -- the latest criticism from President Trump, you  know what, that's who the American people elected, number one. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Good.  I like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, here's the other issue, and he does raise.  People  automatically, who don't like him, want to dismiss him as being a hothead. </p><p>He's not being hot-headed about this.  He's a real estate developer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's watching what we all are, that you had a change in the  -- basically the tax incentive for owning and buying a home in this  country, and the tax plan, you've had home price gains that have slowed for  six straight months, existing home sales declined on an annual basis for  eight straight months.  </p><p>Consumer confidence waning a little bit on the expectations about the  economy and housing, and he's raising the issue of what is neutral?  Are we  in an environment where we might not be able to handle as a nation, as a  world rates higher that are so-called normal based on where they were in  the last 30 or 40 years?  </p><p>Eight percent mortgage?  I don't think that this economy can handle that,  so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And I don't think that's normal.  Is that normal? </p><p>KELLY:  That's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that the -- </p><p>KELLY:  That's (INAUDIBLE) housing.  Housing isn't affordable in a lot of  these states, so the problem is this, they should raise rates so you don't  have speculation in the housing market. </p><p>And that's what they're preventing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's a reason why mortgage  rates are going to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not their job.  Their job isn't to prevent speculation. </p><p>KELLY:  Their -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Their job isn't -- </p><p>KELLY:  Their job is to prevent runaway inflation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Runaway inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what -- </p><p>KELLY:  And what happens when housing inflations go up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the runaway inflation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But there's no -- there isn't.  </p><p>KELLY:  There's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's no inflation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what my point is, is that -- </p><p>KELLY:  Inflation is picking up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not. </p><p>KELLY:  That's why they're raising rates.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in housing, it's not.  And it's actually very, very tame.  </p><p>KELLY:  What housing market are you looking at? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's very, very tame in consumer prices.</p><p>LEE:  I would argue that credit availability is far more important than the  interest rate. </p><p>As we went into the financial crisis, this housing boom and bust, it was  cost rates were much higher than they are right now.  </p><p>Thirty-year mortgages were right around five percent, we're not -- we're  not back there yet, so as long as mortgages are available and money is  available, rates can be much, much higher.  </p><p>So the problem is, is nobody can get a loan and nobody can get a mortgage  and that's changing, and that's moving in the right direction.  </p><p>So, as rates move higher, okay?  And credit availability increases, which  it should with Jay Powell as the Chairman of the Fed, which is why I  believe he was there in the first place, like this should be all right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  What happens is when you have these fundamental shifts, everyone  pauses, takes a break, and reevaluates, and the -- you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again.  That's  changing. </p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what happened  since the election has changed that, reevaluates and you have a lot of very  smart people thinking that interest rates would never go up again, that's  changing.</p><p>Like, you know, President Trump and his fiscal stimulus and what's happened  since the election has changed that, okay?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LEE:  It's an unpleasant, you know, when the engine -- when the engine  moves and the underneath moves, that doesn't always sit well.  </p><p>We've seen a huge spike in volatility in the markets that I don't think is  going to go away, but I think it's short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speak -- just speaking of the volatility, though, the front page  story in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the top story in the paper, is the fed  is now shifting to a less predictable approach on policymaking.  </p><p>It will be based less on forecast of how the economists expect it to  perform in the coming months and more based on the latest signs of  inflation, unemployment and growth, that will increase volatility in the  markets.  </p><p>That's what \"The Journal\" is trying to say in that article.  But -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, when we get that three and a half percent GDP  today, you can expect that we're going to see that rate hike in a week and  a half from the Federal Reserve, that fourth rate hike.  </p><p>Take it to the bank, because I mean we're already expecting the rate hike,  but that three and a half percent GDP is only going to suggest more coming.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then I know that Jay Powell's speaking here in New York at  noon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know you're going to be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to be there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're all going to be watching, so I can't wait to get your read  on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he's got to certainly give us some kind of a vision  in terms of where he thinks this is going, monetary policy and the economy  in general.  </p><p>Let's talk China for a minute because China trade tensions have heated up  this week ahead of the G-20 Summit later this week.  </p><p>The President will sit down for a high-stakes dinner with China's Xi  Jinping.  </p><p>National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, floated a possible  breakthrough in the trade talks. </p><p>He said this yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president said there's a good possibility that we can make a  deal and he is open to it.  </p><p>But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago  are not met and not dealt with, the President has said, look, he's  perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, what are -- what are your thoughts here  actually? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I think the President is possibly going to get a deal with  China.  </p><p>But if he doesn't, he's going to continue to play hardball with him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- which is exactly what we ought to be doing.  </p><p>I'm so proud this President hasn't just rolled over, not just to China but  to everybody.  </p><p>And I know that creates a lot of heartburn for some people because they're  used to an establishment traditional approach, but the traditional approach  has gotten our heads handed to us.  </p><p>And this is a President who, when he goes into one of these negotiations,  does so with the sense not America Only, but America First.  </p><p>And a lot of people in the media don't understand the difference between  America First and America Only.  They think that he's, you know, some  nationalist that doesn't care about the place in the world, that's not  true.  </p><p>But he understands he was not elected to be the global president, but the  American President and thank God for it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If there's -- if there's one thing people will agree on is that  China has been abusing -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- has been the bad actor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's terrible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has been stealing IP.  </p><p>Michael, what's priced into the market in terms of a deal or no deal with  China at this point? </p><p>LEE:  Look, I can't imagine anybody thinking that there would be a dramatic  breakthrough at this dinner.  I would -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No deal is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LEE:  I -- maybe some short-term, maybe we kick the can on some of these  tariffs down the road.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I think you're right because -- </p><p>LEE:  -- and continue talking, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if we were to see a deal, you got upside potential  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>LEE:  Yes.  You know, if there's a short-term deal, I think stocks rally,  but that's short-term.  </p><p>This -- you know, the Cold War went on for like 50 years, this is not going  away.  </p><p>The goal of Chinese is to dominate the world, the goal of the U.S. is to  open up markets and for peace and prosperity. </p><p>BARTIROMO: And to stay the number one country, but China's coming quickly.  </p><p>You -- any final thought on China (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean listen, there's not going to be a deal done, and  they've got their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan on top of their 2025 plan.   There's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning they want to be number one in all the important  industries. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, including military.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.

Big tech continues to move into health care, it  is raising fresh privacy concerns, though.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details on that.  Lauren, good morning. </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>The next frontier for big tech is your health, you might be scared by this,  you might appreciate what they're doing.  Let me explain.  </p><p>So Amazon is using algorithms to sell software that mines through your  health data, your medical records.  </p><p>Why are they doing this?  Well, they want to make money, health care is a  $3.2 trillion market, they are a business, but they also want to save  money, they want to cut costs, they want to prescribe you right the first  time. </p><p>And when you're looking at something like cancer, Amazon is saying in their  press release announcing this, you know, hours can become seconds when you  have software, and algorithms.  </p><p>And the right technology that can go through all that unstructured medical  text and really save a person when you do have certain diseases, the  limiting resource is time.  So, that's where they can come in and help.  </p><p>It's also great for experimental drugs and getting, you know, the right  patients and the right drug trials.  </p><p>Amazon is not the only company getting into health care.  Here's Toby  Cosgrove as he spoke to you a little while ago, Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are now an Advisor to Google.  </p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, GOOGLE ADVISOR:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That in and of itself, I think, is so great that Google is  spending the resources on healthcare expertise. </p><p>COSGROVE:  You know, I think we're seeing increasing interest amongst the  high-tech companies around health care, whether it be apple, whether  watches, and whether it be Microsoft, with the things that they're doing or  Amazon and Google as well. </p><p>Interestingly, we're having explosion in health care, which is, one, a  problem and, B, an opportunity.  </p><p>The problem is that the total amount of knowledge in health care is  doubling every 73 days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an incredibly stat.  </p><p>COSGROVE:  Probably going to have to go to the cloud for people to manage  all this data. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This -- and that becomes the opportunity, so all of this data  being forced on to the cloud gives you an opportunity to apply machine  learning. </p><p>COSGROVE:  Exactly.  Well, on top of that, it also gives you  interoperability. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, can you trust tech with keeping data safe, with going  through you data in the first place with not getting hacked? </p><p>So this is the way we're moving, you know.  You go to the doctor now, the  doctor doesn't come out with a clipboard, he comes out with a laptop, or an  iPad.  You see it all the time.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We're there. </p><p>Do we trust algorithms? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One thing that Toby also said that day when he joined us,  Dagen, was that there are things like a Mobile Stroke Unit, so a person has  a stroke and they are picked up in the ambulance, and right there in this  vehicle, they can perform many of the things.  </p><p>And, you know, when it comes to strokes, the sooner you get to the person,  the more important.  </p><p>So you can actually perform these, you know, procedures and whatever it  takes in the vehicle.  It's called a Mobile Stroke Unit. </p><p>So, some of these technology breakthroughs that we're seeing are really  life-saving.  </p><p>It's putting the data privacy issues aside, but that is also an issue, I  recognize that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  My mother had a stroke, a cancer-related stroke, and the person  that she went to see for it missed it.  She was stroking for about five  days. </p><p>So, again, whatever it takes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for these doctors.  </p><p>And even the patients to make better decisions about their own health, even  just the management of the drugs that you're taking.  With my mom having  stage four metastatic lung cancer, it's very difficult to manage all of the  drugs that she has to take.  </p><p>Very often, the sheets that they print out when you get to the hospital,  there's redundancy, there are drugs on there that she stopped taking four  years ago.  </p><p>Anything to improve patient outcomes to manage the process of caring for  particularly catastrophic illness.  </p><p>And why do we always ask the question, do you trust these big tech  companies with the data?  Why do we trust the government, governor?  </p><p>Because, again, they control all of this Medicare data, vast amounts of  health information, why do we trust the government over big companies? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who says we trust them?  I don't trust any of them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why I said that. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't trust the government, I don't trust the big teach  company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But I think we have to accept the fact that we're no longer  living in the day of Marcus Welby and the little black bag that he comes  over to our homes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And he (INAUDIBLE) put the stethoscope up to our chest and  listens to us.  Those days are gone, and probably we're way, way better off  because they are -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So -- exactly.  So while there are risks in terms of privacy  and hacking with -- into your medical information, do we agree that the  positives as a result of the marriage of technology and health care  outweigh it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of the security of it, not that manipulation, but I  would trust Amazon and a big tech company.  </p><p>Your information is already digitized and out there and it's in the hands  of companies that are not -- their primary business isn't protecting  digital information, so I would say that that at least Amazon and an Apple  would -- might have a better idea of how to protect that information then  say, \"I don't know, a lab testing corporation?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like it sends you -- that sends you the bill with all -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But if the computer gets it wrong, that's what I fear.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That sends you -- that sends you a bill in the mail to the wrong  address that has a list of all the tests and biopsies that had been  performed on you in the last year, that to me is dangerous, not Amazon  basically trying to improve the patient experience and outcomes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  I -- that's amazing that  data is doubling every 73 days in health care.  Lauren, thanks.  Lauren  Simonetti.  </p><p>Coming up, pushback at Google meanwhile employers are saying nothing to the  company's plan to restart search engine operations in China.  More of the  fallout there.  Big debate around this. </p><p>And then life-sized art, one Dutch carpenter is undertaking to create and  sail a true to life version of Noah's Ark, we've got it next, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November  28th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The President versus the Federal Reserve, President Trump slamming Jay  Powell, again, ahead of the Fed chairman's speech today, telling the  Washington Post yesterday, that h is not, at all, happy with Powell.</p><p>Fox Business will bring you that speech live, at noontime today, stay with  us, and you'll hear what Jay Powell has to say about where we are on the  economy, right now.  We are two hours away from the second reading on the  third quarter GDP.  Analysts are expecting growth in the GDP of 3-1/2  percent.</p><p>We will have those numbers, in two hours' time, for you, and show you how  it is impacting markets.  Ahead of report, Futures are showing gain at the  start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials set to be up about 65  points, quarter of a percent higher, the S&amp;P 500 is also up a quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ up 21 points, that's one-third of one percent  higher, right now.</p><p>This after some modest gains yesterday, on Wall Street, the Dow Industrials  picking up 108 points, almost half a percent at the close yesterday, the  S&amp;P was up eight points and the NASDAQ was flat under one point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, here is what the indices look like, and it is very  much a mixed story, FT 100 down 15 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up  eight points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down just about two points,  fractional moves here.</p><p>Asian markets, overnight, higher across the board, better than one percent  in Japan, Hong Kong and China.</p><p>Swatting dragonfly, Google employees telling the technology giant not to go  ahead with a censored search engine for China, we're taking a look at that  this morning.  Plus -- this, ahead of President Trump's upcoming meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, later  this week.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather, Sidney, Australia, hit by its average monthly  rainfall over the course of two hours.</p><p>And a new venture, LeBron James teams up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and  Cindy Crawford, for wellness.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Wednesday morning, but first, this top  story, this half an hour, partisan divide over more tax cuts, House  Republicans now having a new tax package, facing opposition from Democrats,  who say they were blindsided by this proposal.</p><p>The House GOP unveiling their new round of tax cuts, this week, hoping to  pass it during Congress' Lame-Duck Session.  The package would revive  expired tax breaks, address glitches in last year's tax plan, and change  savings and retirement-related provisions.  Here's contributor from The  Hill, the author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate, joining us now to talk  more on taxes.</p><p>Kristin, good see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I don't know how anybody was blind-sided by this.  We've  been hearing about tax cuts 2.0 now, for the last couple of months.  What's  your take on whether or not they're going to be able to get something done,  in this Lame-Duck Session, the next four weeks?</p><p>TATE:  Well, this tax package would allow the GOP to deal with the variety  of issues while they still have control of both chambers of Congress, and  the proposals that includes our relatively noncontroversial, as you  mentioned, like, adding tax relief for people who've been victims of  disasters, making improvements to the IRS and fixing parts of last year's  tax law.</p><p>It would also include parts of the Republican tax reform 2.0 package that  the House passed in September, but not the parts that the Democrats  objected to, most strongly, like making those individual tax cuts,  permanent.</p><p>Now, this needs 60 votes in the Senate, to pass, which means some Democrats  would have to agree to it and come on board.  But I've got to tell you,  Maria, I am highly skeptical that any Democrats are going to support this.   The left has shown that they are in no mood to compromise.</p><p>And it's really unfortunate because, again, this is pretty noncontroversial  stuff, but now the Democrats are saying that they feel like this bill was  put together without their input.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, maybe they should've voted for it, the first time  around, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut plan.  And as you say,  Kristin, Dagen, this is not controversial, how long have we been talking  about them wanting to make individual tax cuts, permanent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not controversial at all.  But again, I don't -- the  Democrats aren't going to do -- one, Governor, they don't believe that you  make better decisions with your money, number one.  Number two, they are  not going to do anything that is a win for the Republicans at this point.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, they're not.  But this is something the Republicans could  have and should have done.  They shouldn't be waiting on the Democrats to  come through.  They've got the votes between now and January.  And as Larry  the Cable Guy, would say, get her done.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, Kristin, I think the important question is, when will we know  this tax bill will get crushed, right?  Is it going to be middle of  December, is our last hope?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out  because the Democrats are going to try to spin this towards their favor.</p><p>TATE:  Yes, I mean, there's very limited time here, and Mitch McConnell has  a packed agenda during the Lame-Duck Session, so I'm not too optimistic.  A  lot of this is about political optics, too.  I mean, the Democrats do not  want to be seen as, kind of, helping Republicans fix Trump's tax law.   They've made it very clear that their priorities are just obstructing  progress.</p><p>And frankly, they're waiting for next year, the Democrats are salivating  over the prospect of a Democrat-controlled House, and they've made it clear  what their priorities will be for tax reform and for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there the 10 percent cut, in taxes, in this  package that the President has been talking about because in addition to  making the individual cuts permanent, the President has said that he wants  to institute an additional tax cut, is that in this Republican package, do  you know, Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm not sure that it's in there, but I think it should be.  It's  one of the things the President has made clear his priorities, but  unfortunately, you've got some leadership in the House right now, that is  never made the President's priorities, their priorities, and they forget  that they were elected by one 435th of the American population.  The  President was elected by the entire country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mean Paul Ryan?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Not to call names, but, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why is he still there?  He said he's stepping down, and  yet, he's -- but you don't see him very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right now, it was Paul Ryan who got in the way of the subpoenas  that Bob Goodlatte wanted to issue for an investigation that started over a  year ago, in October, and he was certainly a hurdle in that process.</p><p>So, we ask, why now?  Why the subpoenas coming out now?  I don't mean to  change the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  And I think that was so inept, I have to  say, I mean, for Bob Goodlatte, to now, subpoena Jim Comey and Loretta  Lynch now, with just a few weeks left, I mean, why wasn't this done sooner?   And why did Paul Ryan say no hearing for Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a lot -- there's a lot of hurdles that -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's all about the money.  It's who the donors are and how  they're controlling what Congress does, and it's one of the things that has  been most frustrating to the President, is because he did not come in with  obligations to all the donors.</p><p>He came in, having financed his own primary, that's the fundamental  difference and is reason he's been effective, but he could be more  effective if he had some cooperation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  President Obama attending the  Baker Institute gala at Rice University, last night, the former president  took some not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only did I not  get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, which by the way,  was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about.   In fact, nobody came close to being indicted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristin, first, let me get your reaction and then I've got to  get yours, Governor, go ahead.</p><p>TATE:  Obama has a lot of nerve making these comments, his own attorney  general Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn  over documents requested by Congress.  His other attorney general, Loretta  Lynch, was viewed as corrupt, for her infamous Tarmac meeting with Bill  Clinton, which happened right before the charges against Hillary Clinton  were dropped.</p><p>But the bigger point here, Maria, is that we live in such a divided time  right now, and these kinds of comments are so divisive, especially coming  from a former president.  I mean, right now, we are at the point where  leaders of both parties are being run out of restaurants by hostile mobs,  you have celebrities glamorizing violence against political foes, and  Antifa, burning down the streets.</p><p>We need rhetoric that brings people together.  And by the way, I've been  equally critical of some of the things Trump has said, as well.  But, you  know, Obama really shouldn't be saying these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TATE:  He should be focused on bringing the country together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the mention, he used all of his agencies as weapons against  his political enemies from the IRS -- </p><p>TATE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to the FBI and the DOJ, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's high comedy that you hear from people on the left that  we need to elevate the discussion and they preach at us that when they go  low, well, we're right there with you.  President Trump speaking and  communicating the way that he does has kind of opened the door to let us  see who all these people are.</p><p>And they're so willing to throw shade and take shots and try and make  jokes, even personal jokes at someone's expense.  Again, they're all --  they're all the same, all of them.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, the smugness of that, to me, was just off-putting, and in  particular, because they didn't indict people in the administration because  they were protected.  Hillary Clinton didn't get indicted for having an  illegal server.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But a 19-year-old sailor did, for God's sake, that's what I  think people need to remember, is that the reason they were never indicted,  anyone in the administration, is because they were a protected class  throughout their administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  How about Jim Comey writing the exoneration letter for  Hillary Clinton, before the interview, before any of the facts were in?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, think about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is such a good point.</p><p>KELLY:  Strzok and Page too.  I mean, that sets an example.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Federal Bureau of matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You call it a matter, not an investigation.  And that's  exactly what he did, he called it a matter.  Kristin, it's great to get  your insights always, come back soon.</p><p>TATE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Kristin Tate joining us there.  Coming up,  Sidney slammed by rain, check this out, the incredible pictures of the  torrential downpour that left the city, largely, underwater.  Then, Krispy  Kreme, delicious holiday, the chain unveiling new Christmas doughnuts which  features an ugly holiday sweater, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, here's a story we've been talking about for some time.   Now, Google is getting pushback from its own employees over controversial  China search projects.  Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  We have been talking about this for a while, Maria.  Some workers  at Google are not happy about the company's plans to restart operations in  China.  At least 10 employees including engineers, directors, managers  published an open letter calling for the company to cancel the initiative;  it's known as Project Dragonfly.  They say it's a \"censored search engine  for the Chinese market that enables state surveillance.\"  The browser will  allegedly be able to suppress search results; the letter has since gotten  dozens of signatures in addition.  Shares of Google parent, Alphabet, are  up less than one percent for the year.</p><p>Well, a powerful rainstorm causing chaos in Sidney, Australia.  More than  500 people call for emergency assistance after the city got its average  monthly rainfall within just two hours.  About a dozen people had to be  rescued from their cars; they were trapped.  And thousands of homes lost  power, dozens of flights were cancelled there.  </p><p>Well, speaking of flooding, a Dutch carpenter has recreated a life-size  Noah's Ark from \"The Great Flood\" bible story.  This is crazy.  He spent  almost $5 million to build the nearly 400-foot long ark which he wants to  sail now from Holland to Israel.  He says, this is a copy of God's ship; it  only makes sense to take it to God's land.  One problem: there's no motor  in the ark.  And he needs at least a million bucks, maybe more, so he can  rent somebody to, well, tug it to Israel from Holland, basically.  So,  we'll see if he raises the money.  </p><p>And then, there is this, Krispy Kreme's holiday doughnuts are back and this  year's selections got a doughnut inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters, yes!   Features green icing, confetti sprinkles and pieces of reindeer and penguin  candy.  And then, the Santa belly doughnut is making its return.  Looks  like, Santa's belly that is filled with chocolate cream on the inside.  A  holiday (INAUDIBLE), there's a classic chocolate ice sprinkles doughnut.   All part of the big line-up -- and no, I don't have doughnuts.  I apologize  now, Maria.  I failed you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we were looking forward to that when we first saw that  story, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Very sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I'm glad they're using ugly sweaters.  Remember our ugly  Christmas sweater party that we had hear on the of MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  </p><p>CASONE:  So much fun.  I saved mine, by the way.  I'm ready to go for this  year.  It is coming back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There we are.  Happy holidays to all of our viewers as we are  coming to you with our ugly sweaters there.  Dagen, that was fun.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, my god, by the way, just FYI, I found -- discovered  yesterday that you can order Krispy Kreme doughnuts and also have them  delivered, I don't know if they're open right now but for future reference,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  I appreciate that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your ugly sweater had Jesus Christ.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I did.  It said, Jesus is (INAUDIBLE).  And I still have it.   I've worn it multiple times --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, I like your reindeer sweater.  Yours was nice, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think mine had a nose on the --  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I do not own an ugly Christmas sweater and that's fine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Says who?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't need one for Christmas, there you go.  So, don't get me  one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want an ugly sweater for Christmas. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll take a break, when we come back wellness by Lebron,  how the basket all-star is teaming up with big name celebs to offer you a  path toward healthy living.  We'll tell you about the products next up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy in the NFL, a player arrested and  charged with domestic violence finding a new team, Jared Max now with the  details, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria,  considering the NFL's track record for being soft on domestic violence and  all the work the league has tried to do to repair narrative, many were  shocked that Reuben Foster was claimed off waivers by the Washington  Redskins, just after he had been released by the 49ers.  While Foster is  not yet allowed to attend practice or games, he can work out at the team  facility.  Redskins say, they fully understand the severity of recent  allegations against him.  A lot of his former teammates who is are now with  the Skins went to bat for his character, which reportedly weighed in on the  decision to bring him on board.  </p><p>Tiger Woods signs an exclusive deal with Golf T.V., a streaming service,  joint venture between Discovery and PGA tour would feather 2,000 hours of  live programming, service scheduled for lunch in January.  </p><p>Three years since baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, denied Pete Rose  reinstatement from a lifetime ban for gambling on baseball.  Rob Manfred  yesterday announced baseball's first partnership with a sports gambling  operation.  Just like with the NBA and NHL -- it's a matrimony with MGM  Resorts worldwide, whose CEO, James Murren says, \"Baseball's perfectly  suited for this, people will be talking about the next pitch, the next out,  the next inning,\" a sentiment echoed by baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred.  </p><p>What does Lebron James have in common with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy  Crawford, Lindsey Vonn?  A health and wellness company that they have  formed called Ladder. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CINDY CRAWFORD, AMERICAN MODEL:  They say, you should do this alone.  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA:  That if you want  something done right, you have to do it yourself.  </p><p>LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN ALPINE SKI RACER:  They say you should never ask for  help.  </p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR AND FILMMAKER:  We say, there's strength in  numbers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  And now, instead of just endorsing somebody else's products, these  four, team up, they get to have control of the product lines.  There's  going to be energy powders to initially start protein powders and they're  going to create content as well that helps people lead to a better build  the ladder to wellness.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it wellness or protein powders?  I mean --</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is protein powder wellness?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, it's almost like the therapy, plus the actual diet, say.  So,  there'd be meetings where they're teaching you how to live the right way.   Lebron is the king of wellness, I think all around, with physical health.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want Arnold Schwarzenegger to yell at me 10 times a day,  get off of your butt and get running.  That's the ticket to health and  wellness, is exercise, and it's not taking protein powders.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I can't get over the hypocrisy of the baseball commissioner.   Teaming up with the gambling operations and saying, Pete Rose, what you did  was terrible but let's do some gambling.  </p><p>MAX:  And I think this opens the door for Pete Rose to get into the hall of  fame and I think (INAUDIBLE) Joe Jackson is turning over in his grave this  morning, they have to get real on this.  </p><p>KELLY:  Pete Rose meet the deadline, though.  Didn't he have only so many  years he could be elected in?  </p><p>MAX:  You know what, seriously, game's all-time hit leader.  (INAUDIBLE),  did he bet against his own team?  Put him in the hall of fame, it's enough  already.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, you --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, I just want to say amen.  Amen and amen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  Amen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's why I like Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah.</p><p>MAX:  I like this guy too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good sports stories today, Jared.  Thank you, Jared Max.  Catch  Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.

On the Hitachi side, the move was seen as a grid grab that would enable the Japanese conglomerate to compete head-to-head with the likes of General Electric and Siemens AG in the electric sector. Not more than a few months later, General Electric began selling off many of its power businesses, while Siemens spun its gas and power businesses off into an as-yet-to-be-named entity with the placeholder name of \u201cNewCo.\"</p><p><br/><br/>What might be behind some of these power play spin-offs? And, are there more to come?<br/><br/>Behind the Spin-Offs<br/><br/>The first factor seems to be activist investors pushing for simplified pure-play companies. For ABB, that meant dropping its lower-margins grid business to focus on robotics and factory automation. In addition to carrying ABB\u2019s lowest return on assets in 2018, the company\u2019s grids business saw its third consecutive quarterly slide in the third quarter of 2018.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Hitachi has almost 800 separate businesses, spanning from construction machinery to health care and nuclear power. The company has stated it wants to streamline and focus on four core areas going forward\u2014one of which is power and energy, thus the reason for ABB\u2019s Power Grids business.<br/><br/>Hitachi may have other things in mind, as well. For instance, by getting a piece of the power grid, the company may be able to help drive a global shift away from coal and toward renewable energy. The company also may be lining up grid services as a platform on which to deploy and connect its equipment to the massive internet of things (IoT) market, connecting sensors and devices through the internet for building controls in homes and businesses that can marry the opportunity of smart devices and smart buildings with the smart electric grid Hitachi will now help to build.<br/><br/>\u201cWe believe that both companies will complement each other,\" said Anders Sjoelin, lead division manager, ABB Power Grids North America. \u201cTogether, they cover the global energy value chain from generation to transmission and distribution. In addition, Hitachi sees areas like the integration of renewables into the power grid, smart mobility and cities as strategic pillars where ABB Power Grids can contribute significantly with its leading technology solutions.\"<br/><br/>The Siemens spin-off is of a slightly different nature, but perhaps has a similar goal. In May 2019, the German-based industrial giant announced the spin-off of its Gas &amp; Power (GP) businesses as part of its Vision 2020+ strategy to focus its core competencies on digital industries and smart infrastructure. To be formed out of what was Siemens GP, the new company will be an independent one in which Siemens projects to have 30 billion Euros in orders and 80,000 employees \u2014 based on former GP staff and the transfer of the Siemens\u2019 renewable energy business, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE).<br/><br/>\u201cWith Vision 2020+, we\u2019re further sharpening Siemens\u2019 focus and making our businesses faster and more flexible,\" said Joe Kaeser, president and CEO of Siemens, in a conference call with reporters announcing the move. \u201cThese changes are laying the foundation for sustainable economic success in growth markets that will be attractive over the long term. We\u2019re also creating solid perspectives for those businesses that have to prove themselves in the structural transformation now underway and address new growth fields.\"<br/><br/>Kaeser added the new company will be well-positioned to offer a wide range of services in the electric industry, from power generation through gas-fired turbines and wind turbines to oil and gas services and high-voltage transmission. \u201cThe success of Siemens\u2019 businesses of the next generation will be determined by new factors,\" said Kaeser. \u201cBreadth, size and a one-size-fits-all approach will be replaced by focus, speed and adaptability.\"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lisa Davis, who has been CEO of Siemens GP for the last five years, will take over the reins of NewCo. She touts the new company\u2019s independence from Siemens as well as the opportunity to offer a wide range of power services in its new incarnation. \u201cBeing independent will enable us to more effectively leverage our position of strength to further support our customers in rapidly changing energy markets,\" Davis said. \u201cGlobal electrification continues to be vital to economic and environmental progress around the world and, as the only company with a leading portfolio along the entire energy value chain\u2014in both conventional and renewable energy\u2014we are uniquely able to help both public- and private-sector customers benefit from these developments.\"<br/><br/>For Siemens, the company\u2019s Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure operating companies will comprise its future industrial core, to be supplemented by company-wide technology and service units such as Siemens Healthineers and Siemens Mobility. Plans call for NewCo to be completely spun off with its own stock exchange listing in September 2020.<br/><br/>General Electric also is in the game of selling off power divisions. In March 2019, the company unveiled a $3.25 billion deal to sell its distributed power business, focused on the building of smaller gas-fired turbines used in backup, remote or cogeneration power opportunities. The sale to private equity firm Advent International includes the company\u2019s Jenbacher and Waukesha brands as well as manufacturing plants in the U.S., Canada and Austria.<br/><br/>GE\u2019s rationale apparently is different from that of ABB or Siemens, however. The company must shrink itself to pay down significant debt, a result of years of troubled acquisitions. Earlier this year, GE was kicked out of the Dow Industrial Average after more than a century on the prestigious company stock listing. For GE, the distributed power business is just the latest in a line of businesses being spun off, including both its fabled light bulb unit and GE Transportation, the company\u2019s 111-year-old railroad division.<br/><br/>The power business was not helping GE, as the company saw declines in revenue in recent quarters as power plants started moving more toward renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, especially coal.<br/><br/>Underlying Currents<br/><br/>Though GE\u2019s move differs from the moves of Hitachi-ABB and Siemens, all three signify changing times in the power and utilities sector, something that is more likely to continue than abate in the near term. \u201cThese are definitely changing times for utility and energy companies,\" said Scott Smith, U.S. power utilities leader for Deloitte, before adding, \u201cIt is going to continue. Decarbonization of power, energy efficiency, renewables, the customer experience being different \u2014 [power companies and utilities] are going to have to adapt quickly, and I think they are.\"<br/><br/>In his 2019 U.S. Power and Utilities Industry Outlook, Smith wrote about what he calls the new normal for the sector, which features a \u201cperiod of transformation and profound change driven by technological and competitive forces, as well as changing customer expectations.\"<br/><br/>\u201cThis is partly generational; younger users have become very comfortable with apps, social media, and always-on connectivity,\" Smith stated. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s also partly a spin-off from the increasing ubiquity of e-commerce in all spheres, for products, services and entertainment. These developments are coming from all directions, not just the big-tech giants that are household names. We\u2019re seeing evidence of this new normal in electricity customer preferences\u2014the desire for choice, in rate plans, in sources of delivered electricity, and in options to tap into behind-the-meter or localized sources of generation, or to integrate electricity with other home services. Commercial and industrial customers are looking to combine more cost and utilization control with opportunities to self-generate and while setting themselves and their suppliers ambitious targets to reduce emissions from their energy use.\"<br/><br/>On the generation side, Smith argued, three dominant trends have been in place for years and look to continue:<br/><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Displacement of coal-fired generation</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Steady growth in natural gas</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Rapid growth in wind and solar power.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Smith pointed to decarbonization as the driver but added these trends also have created opportunities for both new technologies and new business models in the sector. <br/><br/>On the new technologies side, Smith noted utilities are developing apps to give customers greater control over energy usage, even managing heating and cooling, lighting and window blinds from smartphones. Some utilities are entering the IoT market by offering smart appliances, such as washing machines, thermostats and hot water heaters. Wireless meters and sensors enable users to monitor energy use in real time, receive alerts if bills deviate too far from the norm, get outage alerts, and even get estimates of crew arrival times in the case of storms or widespread power failure.<br/><br/>\u201cCustomer retention is no longer just a question of reliability and cost,\" Smith said of this new normal in the power and utilities sector. \u201cIt is now a question of providing options, being connected, and allowing customers more control over their energy use.\"<br/><br/>When it comes to technology, utilities and power generators exist in an ecosystem ripe with opportunity, Smith contends. \u201cWe could point to sources of generation, with the cost performance and scalability of wind and solar continuing to improve year over year at a rapid pace; to grid operations, where smart-grid technologies provide real-time information into all aspects of grid status (not just electron flows) and where batteries are now able to provide multiple services, such as load shifting, frequency regulation and localized reserves; to distributed or localized sources of energy for which utilities can partner with customers or communities to install and operate power systems customized for specific needs,\" Smith wrote in his report.<br/><br/>Smith summed it up that all this combined is opening the door for new business models for utilities as well as market structures allowing for the entry of new, nontraditional players. He specifically cited the rise of behind-the-meter generation, community energy projects and new options for households, such as rooftop solar coupled with battery storage. \u201cUtilities have a tremendous opportunity to develop new profitable businesses around offering services related to these developments\u2014from installation, maintenance, and reliability services to tracking and load balancing with on-grid resources,\" Smith wrote.<br/><br/>Smith sees the sector evolving into an \u201centire energy tech ecosystem\" that could include traditional utilities, large device makers, tech companies, infrastructure players, and small- to medium-sized venture-backed energy technology companies and a host of other business models.<br/><br/>Smith proclaims himself \u201cnot surprised at all\" by news of power and utility sector spin-offs and realignments. In fact, he predicts that, too, is part of the new normal for the sector.<br/><br/>\u201cBy definition, the future is uncertain, so we know there will be surprises along the way,\" Smith wrote in his market report. \u201cThe electric power business has proved increasingly resilient to some kinds of surprises, like hurricanes or snowstorms. Other kinds of surprises, from technology and new competition to customer expectations, may require more deep-seated cultural change. This promises to be an interesting year.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRANDW-497176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRANDW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNC-G9Y1-JBKS-P1CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Informa Business Media, Inc.

While he wished Mr. Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Mr. Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator's policy positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"And he said, 'I assume you mean on things like tech,'\" Mr. Lambert recalled recently. \"And I said, 'Well, mainly.'\"</p><p>Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The rising movement in the United States to consider charging the country's biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics like Mr. Lambert; lawmakers like Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.</p><p>These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country. </p><p>But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general's office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley's giants. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign. </p><p>Mr. Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri's law school with Mr. Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook's chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company's most valuable services.</p><p>\"I firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,\" Mr. Hawley said.</p><p>His actions have pushed Mr. Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Mr. Hawley says he does not remember.</p><p>\"This thinking is dangerous for conservatives,\" Mr. Lambert recently tweeted after Mr. Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech's critics, recently denouncing their \"snobbery and know-betterism.\"</p><p>At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers, and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.</p><p>Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate, and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.</p><p>\"I think the antitrust laws are flexible,\" Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be \"vigorously enforced.\"</p><p>Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like factoring in the effect that a company's dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.</p><p>\"What has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,\" said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.</p><p>Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech's critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations. </p><p>Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law \"has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.\" Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing \"should be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.\"</p><p>The tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.</p><p>Mr. Lambert and Mr. Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law &amp;amp; Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies. Geoffrey Manne, the center's leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some \"have received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.\" Mr. Lambert also sits on the organization's board - a position for which, he says, he is not paid.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Senator Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law. </p><p>As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, Mr. Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years where he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Mr. Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The GoogleTransparency Project, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant's connections to government, recently raised questions about whether he was influenced by donations from Google and its allies. </p><p>Mr. Lee dismissed those accusations as \"paranoid fantasy.\" (The GoogleTransparency Project has itself received funding from Oracle, a Google competitor.)</p><p>Recently, the antitrust holdouts have found a new ally in the industrialist Charles Koch. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads this year urging senators and attorneys general to stick to the current approach to antitrust.</p><p>Still, many of those arguing to keep the legal status quo acknowledge that the debate has shifted, with their opponents' position becoming rapidly more mainstream.</p><p>Mr. Lee said last month that the pushback was \"not necessarily going to get you a lot of favorable publicity.\"</p><p>The debate can take on a heated and personal tone. At a conference this spring, the soft-spoken legal academic Tim Wu responded to doubts raised by Tyler Cowen, an economist, about whether America has dangerous levels of corporate concentration by saying it was like arguing with someone who believes the earth is flat. Another speaker at the same event compared one critic of the antimonopoly position to a climate change denier.</p><p>The enmity goes both ways. Some conservatives have applied a dismissive nickname to the efforts to rethink the existing laws: hipster antitrust.</p><p>The holdouts may have one long-term advantage: For now, they say, federal judges are likely to agree with them. Antitrust doctrine is largely settled in court, and judges largely support it. Mr. Crane, the Michigan professor, noted that those judges could take a long time to change their ways.</p><p>Mr. Lee is biding his time.</p><p>\"Over the last two or three years, there has been something of a shift,\" he said. \"Only time will tell whether it proves to be a momentary fad or something more significant.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006777068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFV-3271-JC85-N366-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While he wished Mr. Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Mr. Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator\u2019s policy positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAnd he said, \u2018I assume you mean on things like tech,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lambert recalled recently. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, mainly.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">rising movement in the United States</url> to consider charging the country\u2019s biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics like Mr. Lambert; lawmakers like Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.</p><p>These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country. </p><p>But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general\u2019s office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign. </p><p>Mr. Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri\u2019s law school with Mr. Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook\u2019s chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company\u2019s most valuable services.</p><p>\u201cI firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,\u201d Mr. Hawley said.</p><p>His actions have pushed Mr. Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Mr. Hawley says he does not remember.</p><p>\u201cThis thinking is dangerous for conservatives,\u201d Mr. Lambert <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">recently tweeted</url> after Mr. Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech\u2019s critics, recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">denouncing</url> their \u201csnobbery and know-betterism.\u201d</p><p>At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers, and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.</p><p>Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate, and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.</p><p>\u201cI think the antitrust laws are flexible,\u201d Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be \u201cvigorously enforced.\u201d</p><p>Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">factoring in the effect</url> that a company\u2019s dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,\u201d said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.</p><p>Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech\u2019s critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations. </p><p>Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law \u201chas emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.\u201d Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing \u201cshould be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.\u201d</p><p>The tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.</p><p>Mr. Lambert and Mr. Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law &amp;amp; Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies. Geoffrey Manne, the center\u2019s leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some \u201chave received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.\u201d Mr. Lambert also sits on the organization\u2019s board \u2014 a position for which, he says, he is not paid.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Senator Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law. </p><p>As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, Mr. Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years where he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Mr. Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The GoogleTransparency Project, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant\u2019s connections to government, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">recently</url> raised questions about whether he was influenced by donations from Google and its allies. </p><p>Mr. Lee dismissed those accusations as \u201cparanoid fantasy.\u201d (The GoogleTransparency Project has itself <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">received funding</url> from Oracle, a Google competitor.)</p><p>Recently, the antitrust holdouts have found a new ally in the industrialist Charles Koch. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads this year urging senators and attorneys general to stick to the current approach to antitrust.</p><p>Still, many of those arguing to keep the legal status quo acknowledge that the debate has shifted, with their opponents\u2019 position becoming rapidly more mainstream.</p><p>Mr. Lee said last month that the pushback was \u201cnot necessarily going to get you a lot of favorable publicity.\u201d</p><p>The debate can take on a heated and personal tone. At a conference this spring, the soft-spoken legal academic Tim Wu responded to doubts raised by Tyler Cowen, an economist, about whether America has dangerous levels of corporate concentration by saying it was like arguing with someone who believes the earth is flat. Another speaker at the same event compared one critic of the antimonopoly position to a climate change denier.</p><p>The enmity goes both ways. Some conservatives have applied a dismissive nickname to the efforts to rethink the existing laws: hipster antitrust.</p><p>The holdouts may have one long-term advantage: For now, they say, federal judges are likely to agree with them. Antitrust doctrine is largely settled in court, and judges largely support it. Mr. Crane, the Michigan professor, noted that those judges could take a long time to change their ways.</p><p>Mr. Lee is biding his time.</p><p>\u201cOver the last two or three years, there has been something of a shift,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly time will tell whether it proves to be a momentary fad or something more significant.\u201d</p><p>PHOTOS: Senator Mike Lee of Utah (PHOTOGRAPH BY ERIN SCHAFF FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES);

But, as advocates of lower corporate taxes routinely point out, the cost of corporate taxes and regulations doesn't come out of some vast corporate vault filled with gold coins, a la Scrooge McDuck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those costs are borne by the paychecks of corporations' employees and customers alike. This is why taxpayers should be alarmed by the recent and bipartisan efforts to upend our nation's antitrust laws.</p><p> Under the antitrust microscope of both Congress and state attorneys general are America's \"Big Tech\" companies, particularly Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple and Facebook. However, none of these firms neatly fit the bill for antitrust action under the current understanding of the law.</p><p> For starters, all of these companies vigorously compete with one another in multiple market segments, from advertising to hardware sales. Just last year, Facebook and Apple executives traded barbs in the media regarding the privacy practices of each other's companies.</p><p> Companies that don't compete with one another generally don't behave like this. When's the last time Coca-Cola and Goodyear publicly traded insults?</p><p> In addition, for the last half-century or so American antitrust law has been grounded in what is known as the consumer welfare standard. As its name implies, antitrust action is generally only pursued if a merger, acquisition or practice of a company or companies is harming the consumer through things like higher prices. In the case of big tech, it's hard to see where this is occurring.</p><p> Many of the consumer-facing services provided by firms such as Facebook and Google are provided at no cost to the consumer. Those businesses are fueled by advertising, which has seen collapsing prices.</p><p> One of the key complaints against Amazon? Their prices are too low. Even in hardware sales, a cornerstone of Apple's business, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that prices have been cut in half over the last decade.</p><p> Simply put, any case against these big tech firms would be very weak. You'd be hard-pressed to find an American that would have rather gone through the last few months of coronavirus-related shutdowns without being able to order cheap supplies from Amazon or connect with loved ones on Facebook from their Google Android or Apple iPhone.</p><p> Of course, nothing stops politicians looking to make names for themselves. They come from both sides of the aisle and from the federal and state governments. Most seem to be exhibiting the \"first day of prison\" strategy, picking a fight with the biggest brute in the yard to establish their own dominance.</p><p> The trouble is that the consumer welfare standard is standing guard and naturally must be dispatched with first.</p><p> Unmooring antitrust law from the consumer welfare standard might allow politicians to pursue their various pet grievances, from content moderation to privacy, against big tech companies.</p><p> But it would also open the floodgates on the rest of the economy.</p><p> Political actors throughout government could potentially attach all sorts of entirely peripheral strings to antitrust enforcement. Could a merger be weighed by its impact on carbon emissions? Or how many of their products are sourced from America versus overseas?</p><p> We already see shameful examples of this, with companies avoiding antitrust scrutiny through jobs guarantees and other token promises for politicians to put in press releases.</p><p> The uncertainty of political demands, let alone new regulations imposed through antitrust enforcement threats and action, would amount to an enormous cost passed directly to American consumers through higher prices and reduced economic dynamism.</p><p> There are prominent figures on both sides of the aisle eager to toss aside the shackles of the consumer welfare standard for short-term political gain. This is purely an issue of government accountability.</p><p> Regardless of the various complaints about big tech, four companies competing in various markets where prices are falling (if they aren't already zero) cannot possibly pose a bigger threat to taxpayers than granting political actors unchecked authority through a rewrite of antitrust.</p><p> Patrick Hedger is vice president of policy for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BHERLD-505053342967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EA9601E9FB0B18A BHERLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YG-RG81-JBCN-4026-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145223</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Boston Herald Inc.

Other states, including Florida, recently took similar steps that free up municipalities such as Tallahassee that want to provide the service. Utilities such as Florida Power &amp; Light are also considering BPL.</p><p>The federal government also has pledged its support for BPL as a way to ensure that high-speed Internet service reaches every corner of the country.</p><p>Suddenly, \"there's a lot of good momentum,\" said Scott Bruce, managing director of Current Communications Group, which two weeks ago got a major investment _ $100 million, according to published reports _ from Google, media giant Hearst Corp. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Current manages one of only a few commercial deployments of BPL service in the nation, near Cincinnati.</p><p>The problem is, the new momentum might be too little, too late. BPL may never become more than a niche technology limited to rural areas that can't get Internet service over TV cables or DSL telephone lines.</p><p>The idea of plugging into the World Wide Web by simply plugging into a wall socket has been around nearly as long as those two dominant broadband technologies.</p><p>With BPL, data travels over power lines from an Internet connection at a power plant to homes and offices. A customer simply plugs a computer into a wall socket or connects to a wireless transmitter mounted on a nearby power pole.</p><p>Just as significantly, BPL can give power companies unprecedented control over their power lines. With it, utilities can monitor lines for problems, read meters remotely and turn service on or off without dispatching employees.</p><p>\"Yes, you can provide consumers an alternative to cable and DSL, but more importantly this is a major tool that can transform utilities and bring them into the 21st century,\" said Raymond Blair, vice president of BPL initiatives for IBM.</p><p>Last week, IBM announced it was partnering with Houston's CenterPoint Energy Inc. to explore BPL technology and test it in about 50 homes.</p><p>Atlanta-based utility giant Southern Co. has been considering BPL for nearly seven years. So far, the most intriguing application of the technology is for monitoring power lines and other equipment, said Leif Ericson, business development manager at Southern's telecom subsidiary.</p><p>\"We don't see ourselves as a broadband service provider or some sort of other ISP,\" Ericson said. \"Our real focus \u2026 has been on whether we might be able to overlay (BPL) to gain access to all sorts of intelligence\" about existing lines and equipment.</p><p>In all, about 40 utilities around the country have run or plan to run BPL trials.</p><p>Yet with the exception of Current partner Cinergy Corp. in Ohio, no investor-owned utility has committed to selling the service yet.</p><p>Even at Cinergy, some are less than enthusiastic about the year-old experiment.</p><p>\"We didn't anticipate this was going to happen overnight,\" said Cinergy spokeswoman Kathy Meinke. \"We're continuing to move forward.\"</p><p>Neither Cinergy nor Current would disclose how many customers have signed up for the service. While Cinergy earlier said it would expand beyond Cincinnati and into neighboring Warren and Butler counties by next year, any expansion plans are still \"yet to be determined,\" Meinke said.</p><p>Partly what has kept more utilities from rolling out BPL is the cost. While the power lines that can carry broadband signals are already in place, it can cost $250 or more per household for equipment that gets the signals from a home to the power pole or underground line.</p><p>That's actually relatively cheap compared to cable and DSL equipment. But utilities are notoriously tight when it comes to spending on new technology. And the last time many of them strayed from their core business and tried to offer telephone voice service, they failed miserably.</p><p>Meanwhile, early BPL technology was slow and plagued with problems. Download speeds were only a little better than dial-up service, and radio operators complained the equipment caused interference.</p><p>Newer semiconductor technology has solved interference problems, industry officials claim. At the same time, BPL now offers both downloads and uploads at 3 megabits per second _ double the speed of DSL, and faster than cable at a comparable price.</p><p>But performance may have become a moot point because of utilities' lateness to the broadband business.</p><p>Today, with cable modem and DSL available to an estimated 90 percent of all households, there really isn't much of a market left for utilities offering BPL, said Jim Penhune, an analyst with technology research company Strategy Analytics.</p><p>\"I just think the timing of it is wrong,\" Penhune said. \"Cable (and telephone) companies are so far ahead \u2026 it's a little hard for me to see how a third class of network is going to be viable.\"</p><p>BPL proponents disagree, of course.</p><p>The recent interest from the big tech companies shows that the technology still has plenty of promise, said Brett Kilbourne, director of regulatory services for the trade group United Power Line Council. Along with Google and IBM, Motorola in May announced it was developing BPL technology and said it was teaming up with a rural South Carolina utility to launch BPL broadband service. Last year, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc. also announced it was exploring BPL technology.</p><p>At the same time, Kilbourne and other proponents say, there are still plenty of households _ 13 million by some counts _ that aren't able to get broadband access because cable and telecom companies simply don't offer it in their areas.</p><p>Also driving interest in BPL are recent court decisions that limit Internet companies' access to cable and phone lines.</p><p>Atlanta-based Earthlink Inc., for instance, has run several trials in North Carolina and elsewhere and is very encouraged, said Earthlink vice president Kevin Brand.</p><p>BPL's best shot at success may be in reaching rural households, said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Laszlo.</p><p>As a result, Laszlo predicts alternative broadband technologies including BPL, fixed wireless and satellite will triple their customers over the next five years, although they will still account for less than 3 percent of the broadband business.</p><p>Hilco Electric Cooperative north of Waco, Texas earlier this year launched a BPL pilot program that brought high-speed Internet service to its members for the first time.</p><p>Hilco general manager Gerald Lemons compared it to the introduction of electricity to rural areas in the 1930s by government-sponsored cooperatives.</p><p>\"For us, it's the same principle as 60-plus years ago when investor-owned utilities wouldn't run power to rural areas because it wasn't cost-effective,\" Lemons said. \"This is letting folks in rural areas have some of the same things that folks have in the suburbs and urban areas.\"</p><p>Lemons declined to say how many of the cooperative's 19,000 members have signed up for BPL service or how much they pay, citing confidentiality agreements with third-party Internet partners.</p><p>The biggest benefit for rural residents might be that BPL has finally lured other high-speed Internet providers to the area.</p><p>Shortly after Hilco began offering service in one rural neighborhood, Lemons said, telecom giant SBC Corp. started offering DSL service there for the first time.</p><p>\"If you believe the objective is just to get these amenities to rural areas \u2026 we're already successful,\" he said.</p><p>Bob Keefe's e-mail address is bkeefe(at)coxnews.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COXNWS2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4GMR-HXC0-000H-C4BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157001</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1321\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Cox News Service</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Cox Enterprises, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>July 14, 2005 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Thanks for waking up with us.                       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAST DEADLINE AND OVER THE CHARACTER COUNT: We're down to the final days of Joe Biden's veepstakes and the short list is, well, still quite long. As the presumptive Democratic nominee's search for a running mate is expected to drag into next week, past the original Aug. 1 deadline, the competition among some of the party's brightest stars - and their allies - has only intensified.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fight to elect the first female vice president in history, however, has also supercharged the conversation about sexism in politics - especially as the candidates are forced to confront gendered personal jabs made by prominent men.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"Even some longtime Biden allies worry the process has become 'messier than it should be,' pitting women, especially Black women, against one another,\" our colleague Annie Linskey reports.\u00a0          </p><p>             Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has been accused of being \"too ambitious\" and \"rub[bing] people the wrong way.\" Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), the latest target of negative attention, is now seeking to clean up her past warm comments on Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro and the Church of Scientology - and making a point to stress that she could not see herself as a future presidential candidate.          </p><p>\"It's been relentless. It's been unfortunate. But I must say it's been predictable,\" Donna Brazile, a former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, told Annie. \"It's extremely disappointing, because many of these attacks ... are being made by Democratic men who should know better.\"</p><p>\"It bugs me that people want to pit these two Black women against the other,\" Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a key Biden confidant, told Annie of a brewing Bass vs. Harris narrative. \"Nobody is trying to pit Sen. Elizabeth Warren against [Michigan Gov. Gretchen] Whitmer. And both of their names are being mentioned every day as being in the search.\"</p><p>And Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a longtime Biden ally, focused on the smile and personality in assessing the buzz about another contender, former national security adviser Susan E. Rice: \"She was smiling on TV, something that she doesn't do all that readily,\" Rendell told Annie. \"She was actually somewhat charming on TV, something that she has not seemed to care about in the past.\"          </p><p>Biden is expected to interview five or six finalists, instead of the traditional three, contributing to \"a sense, even among Biden's closest advisers, that Biden is entering the final phase of the search without a clear favorite,\" Annie notes. In addition to Harris, Bass, Rice, Warren and Whitmer, other possibilities include Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.           </p><p>The indecision has consequences: \"Several people interviewed said the delay has intensified currents, many of them sexist, that have been swirling for weeks. The resulting backbiting risks inflaming divisions within the party that complicated the 2016 campaign - but that Biden has worked to coalesce since locking down the nomination in the spring.\"</p><p>More on what Biden's looking for from the New York Times's Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns, and Katie Glueck: \u00a0             \"Mr. Biden is said to be focused on finding a running mate he regards as capable of advancing his priorities in governing and who can be counted on not to stray from the urgent challenges facing the nation to pursue their own political priorities, according to people familiar with his thinking. His advisers would also prefer a running mate who would not present a rich political target for President Trump, given that the incumbent is lagging badly in the polls and has so far struggled to deliver credible negative attacks against Mr. Biden.\"</p><p>Biden's search committee has faced public and private pressure to choose a Black running mate in the wake of protests against systemic racism that have gripped the country: \"A small group of strategists and activists who have been pressing for a Black woman recently spoke with members of the search committee, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation,\" Martin, Burns and Glueck report. \"They discussed the electoral map and how the political environment in the country had shifted following the killing of George Floyd in police custody in May.\"</p><p>In the meantime, candidates are making the rounds. Bass went on NBC News's \"Meet the Press\" to parry back criticism about her previous comments leveled by Republicans. She insisted her position on Cuba was \"really no different than the position of the Obama administration\": \"I don't consider myself a Castro sympathizer,\" she said.          </p><p>And Bass sought to diffuse any perceived tension with Harris after Politico called her the \"anti-Kamala Harris\": \"I would never want to be labeled the 'anti-Kamala Harris,'\" she tweeted. \"We're fortunate to have had her as Attorney General and now as Senator. She would be an excellent VP and the same goes for anyone else on the list.\"          </p><p>\"Why are you comparing me with her?\" Bass said on the radio show \"The Breakfast Club.\" \"Why don't you compare Whitmer with Warren?\"</p><p>             Harris appeared to addressed the backbiting, too, in the wake of comments from Florida bundler John Morgan, who said she'd be \"running for president the day of the inauguration,\" and from former              Sen. Chris Dodd, a member of Biden's vetting team who reportedly said Harris had \"no remorse\" about attacking Biden on the debate stage. Harris encouraged viewers of the Black Women Lead 2020 conference to embrace their ambition and \"black girl magic.\"          </p><p>             \"There will be a resistance to your ambition, there will be people who say to you, 'you are out of your lane,'\" Harris said. \"They are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be. But don't you let that burden you.\"          </p><p>             The eventual pick, whoever it is, will likely serve as an injection of enthusiasm to a campaign that has been derailed by the global pandemic. Our Jenna Johnson and Holly Bailey write this morning that Biden supporters in key states that may decide the presidential election want the former vice president to expand his presence and message.          </p><p>\"They are lobbying for Biden to take a more aggressive stance, worried that despite his seeming advantage he has failed so far to persuade people to vote for him - not simply against Trump,\" per Jenna and Holly.</p><p>\"I want to see Democrats doing more to get one another excited for this race,\" Pennsylvania state Rep. Ryan Bizzarro (D), whose Erie County district split its vote in 2016, told them. \"I want some more movement up here, I want a presence up here. I think that's really needed. It's needed now more than ever.\"</p><p>There are some indications that the Biden team is scaling up: \"In several key states, the candidate's visibility has increased each week, many Democrats say - more ads on televisions and radio, more mentions on social media, more signs in yards - and there's widespread optimism that the campaign will be a powerful force by Labor Day, the traditional start of all-out general-election campaigning. The campaign plans to have more than 2,000 staff members in battleground states by then.\"          </p><p>TRUMP EYES UNILATERAL ACTION AS RELIEF PLAN STALLS: \"The Trump administration is looking at options for unilateral actions it can take to try to address some of the economic fallout caused by the pandemic if no relief deal is reached with Congress,\" Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report this morning.</p><p>\"It's not clear what steps the administration could take without the help of Congress on issues such as lapsed enhanced unemployment benefits or the expired moratorium on evictions - the two matters [Trump] has recently identified as his highest priorities in the ongoing talks. Both of those programs were authorized by Congress earlier this year but were designed to be temporary.\"</p><p>BOTH SIDES STILL FAR APART ON RELIEF PLAN: \"Cases are surging, the fragile economic recovery has stalled and millions of jobless Americans just lost emergency unemployment benefits. In response, Congress is doing what it does best: nothing at all,\" Erica and Seung Min Kim report this morning.</p><p>What happened?: \"At that time, the new virus that was wreaking economic havoc around the nation was so alarming it seemed to startle lawmakers out of their partisan corners,\" our colleagues write about the passage of the $3 trillion Cares Act. \"But now the election is nearing, and the novel coronavirus is not so novel. The partisan divisions are back on Capitol Hill, and they appear to be as intractable as ever.\"</p><p>Key quote: \"In order to cut deals and find compromise in this hyperpartisan political environment you have to have at least a small amount of trust in each other,\" Jim Manley, who was a top aide to former Senate Democratic leader Harry M. Reid of Nevada, told our colleagues. \"The problem right now is that no one trusts their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\"</p><p>Where talks stand: \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows made clear in separate interviews that they remain far apart on [a deal] that would restore expired unemployment benefits for millions of Americans,\" Erica and Eli Rosenberg report.</p><p>There were some signs of progress during a rare weekend meeting at the Capitol: \"They plan to meet again [today], but pointed to multiple areas of disagreement that suggest consensus remains elusive, even while saying they would continue to work toward a deal,\" our colleagues write.          </p><p>\"We still have a long ways to go,\" Meadows said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"I'm not optimistic that there will be a solution in the very near term.\"</p><p>MICROSOFT BACK TO EYEING TIKTOK: \"Microsoft said it will continue talks to buy short-form video app TikTok after its chief executive spoke with [Trump], following a weekend of uncertainty clouding the future of the Chinese-owned app,\" Rachel Lerman reports.</p><p>Such a deal could dramatically alter the Big Tech landscape: \"Microsoft, currently valued at $1.55 trillion, is the third-most valuable company in the world and is one of the only ones positioned to take on such a purchase,\" our colleagues write.          </p><p>             A handful of Senate Republicans endorsed the plan: But Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who chairs the Commerce Committee, cautioned that \"tight security measures need to be part of any deal in order to protect consumer data and ensure no foreign access,\" Reuters's David Shepardson reports.</p><p>             Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been critical of TikTok's Chinese ownership: Pompeo said on Fox News's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that Trump will take action \"shortly.\" The secretary repeated the charge that TikTok is \"             feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party,\" a charge TikTok denies.          </p><p>Geoffrey A. Fowler, who has done a number of privacy-related investigations for The Post, previously wrote, \"there's scant evidence that TikTok is sharing our data with China, and we should be wary of xenophobia dressed up as privacy concerns.\"          </p><p>HIGH HOPES FOR INSTANT VACCINE FIX UNREALISTIC: \"Public health experts are discussing among themselves a new worry: that hopes for a vaccine may be soaring too high. The confident depiction by politicians and companies that a vaccine is imminent and inevitable may give people unrealistic beliefs about how soon the world can return to normal - and even spark resistance to simple strategies that can tamp down transmission and save lives in the short term,\" Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.</p><p>Where things stand: \"Two coronavirus vaccines entered the final stages of human testing last week, a scientific speed record that prompted top government health officials to utter words such as 'historic' and 'astounding.' Pharmaceutical executives predicted to Congress in July that vaccines might be available as soon as October, or before the end of the year.\"</p><p>Declaring there's a safe vaccine is just the beginning: \"Deploying the vaccine to people in the United States and around the world will test and strain distribution networks, the supply chain, public trust and global cooperation. It will take months or, more likely, years to reach enough people to make the world safe,\" our colleague writes.          </p><p>             Government researchers are also wary of political pressure: \"Under constant pressure from a White House anxious for good news and a public desperate for a silver bullet to end the crisis, the government's researchers are fearful of political intervention in the coming months and are struggling to ensure that the government maintains the right balance between speed and rigorous regulation, according to interviews with administration officials, federal scientists and outside experts,\" the New York Times reports.</p><p>WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:</p><p>They're home.: \"NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley completed a fiery, high-speed journey back from the International Space Station on Sunday, splashing down in calm Gulf of Mexico waters off the coast of Pensacola, Fla., hundreds of miles from a churning Tropical Storm Isaias in the Atlantic in a triumphal denouement to a historic mission,\" Jacob Bogage and Christian Davenport report.</p><p>It was a historic mission: \"It was the first time in the 59-year history of crewed American space travel that astronauts had used the Gulf as a landing site, adding to other firsts that marked a new chapter in NASA's human spaceflight program: the first launch of American astronauts to orbit from U.S. soil since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 and the first launch into orbit of humans on vehicles owned and operated by a private company.\"</p><p>Isaias poised to sock East Coast: \"Tropical Storm Isaias skirted Florida's east coast on Sunday, brushing it with occasional gusty showers, and roughing up the surf. But the storm, which has spared the Sunshine State from its most severe weather, is just beginning its tour of the U.S. mainland,\" Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow report.</p><p>What to expect: \"It is set to charge up the entire East Coast, crashing ashore in the Carolinas [tonight], before surging up the rest of the Eastern Seaboard from Virginia to Maine and exiting late Wednesday. Tropical storm warnings and watches stretch from the Florida coast to Long Island, including Norfolk, the Chesapeake Bay area, D.C., Philadelphia, coastal New Jersey, and New York City.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-c797c923c9f74b4cbc1d19fcf4ef137e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-SHW1-JB4M-V0WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2457\"/><timeReceived>10:44 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS813940 POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC8651 POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Electoral College</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc1ODBFQkRGMTgxNDU1RkI0ODNDQTAyNDk0QzBEMjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkU1RUMwMTVEOUNENERDRUE1QjJBRkYyMUIwRTk3RUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813940GM</classCode><className>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

America is home to 15 of the world's 20 most valuable tech firms, Europe has one.</p><p>Silicon Valley is where the brainiest ideas meet the smartest money. America is also where the debate rages loudly over how to tame the tech giants, so that they act in the public interest. Tech tycoons face roastings by congress for their firms' privacy lapses. Elizabeth Warren, a senator who is running for president in 2020, wants Facebook to be broken up.</p><p>Yet if you want to understand where the world's most powerful industry is heading, look not to Washington and California, but to Brussels and Berlin. In an inversion of the rule of thumb, while America dithers the European Union is acting.</p><p>This week Google was fined $US1.7bn ($2.4bn) for strangling competition in the advertising market. Europe could soon pass digital copyright laws. Spotify has complained to the EU about Apple's alleged antitrust abuses. And the EU is pioneering a distinct tech doctrine that aims to give individuals control over their own information and the profits from it, and to prise open tech firms to competition.</p><p>If the doctrine works, it could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility.</p><p>Western regulators have had showdowns over antitrust with tech firms before, including IBM in the 1960s and Microsoft in the 1990s. But today's giants are accused not just of capturing huge rents and stifling competition, but also of worse sins, such as destabilising democracy (through misinformation) and abusing individual rights (by invading privacy).</p><p>As AI takes off, demand for information is exploding, making data a new and valuable resource. Yet vital questions remain: who controls the data? How should the profits be distributed? The only thing almost everyone can agree on is that the person deciding cannot be Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's scandal-swamped boss.</p><p>The idea of the EU taking the lead on these questions will seem bizarre to many executives who view it as an entrepreneurial wasteland and the spiritual home of bureaucracy. In fact, Europe has clout and new ideas.</p><p>The big five tech giants, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, make on average a quarter of their sales there. And as the world's biggest economic bloc, the EU's standards are often copied in the emerging world. Europe's experience of dictatorship makes it vigilant about privacy. Its regulators are less captured by lobbying than America's and its courts have a more up-to-date view of the economy. Europe's lack of tech firms helps it take a more objective stance.</p><p>A key part of Europe's approach is deciding what not to do. For now it has dismissed the option of capping tech firms' profits and regulating them like utilities, which would make them stodgy, permanent monopolies. It has also rejected breakups: thanks to network effects, one of the Facebabies or Googlettes might simply -become dominant again. Instead the EU's doctrine marries two approaches. One draws on its members' cultures, which, for all their differences, tend to protect individual privacy. The other uses the EU's legal powers to boost competition.</p><p>The first leads to the assertion that you have sovereignty over data about you: you should have the right to access them, amend them and determine who can use them. This is the essence of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose principles are already being copied by many countries across the world.</p><p>The next step is to allow interoperability between services, so that users can easily switch between providers, shifting to firms that offer better financial terms or treat customers more ethically. (Imagine if you could move all your friends and posts to Acebook, a firm with higher privacy standards than Facebook and which gave you a cut of its advertising revenues.) One model is a scheme in Britain called Open Banking, which lets bank customers share their data on their spending habits, regular payments and so on with other providers. A new report for Britain's government says that tech firms must open up in the same way.</p><p>Europe's second principle is that firms cannot lock out competition. That means equal treatment for rivals who use their platforms. The EU has blocked Google from competing unfairly with shopping sites that appear in its search results or with rival browsers that use its Android operating system.</p><p>A German proposal says that a dominant firm must share bulk, anonymised data with competitors, so that the economy can function properly instead of being ruled by a few data-hoarding giants. Germany has changed its laws to stop tech giants buying up scores of start-ups that might one day pose a threat.</p><p>Europe's approach offers a new vision, in which consumers control their privacy and how their data are monetised. Their ability to switch creates competition that should boost choice and raise standards. The result should be an economy in which consumers are king and information and power are dispersed. It would be less cosy for the tech giants. They might have to offer a slice of their profits (the big five made $US150bn last year) to their users, invest more or lose market share.</p><p>The European approach has risks. It may prove hard to achieve true interoperability between firms. So far, GDPR has proved clunky. The open flow of data should not cut across the concern for privacy. Here Europe's bureaucrats will have to rely on entrepreneurs, many of them American, to provide answers.</p><p>The other big risk is that Europe's approach is not adopted elsewhere, and the continent becomes a tech Galapagos, cut off from the mainstream.</p><p>But the big firms will be loath to split their businesses into two continental silos. And there are signs that America is turning more European on tech: California has adopted a law similar to GDPR. Europe is edging towards cracking the big-tech puzzle in a way that empowers consumers, not the state or secretive monopolies. If it finds the answer, Americans should not hesitate to copy it - even if that means looking to the lands their ancestors left behind.The Economist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-217e6f864c5611e9bc6e45dd77ae005feeb2b6c7cc1eebdf4d61cf426e8f8adf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPJ-7C91-F0JP-W0BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1073\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 23, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. We are live. It is Monday, March 23rd. Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coronavirus stimulus stalled in the Senate. Democrats blocking the nearly $2 trillion emergency package last night. We are taking a look at what's holding the much-needed stimulus back as another vote is expected today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the uncertainty over the stimulus sending futures plummeting this morning. It is going to be a tough day at the office. Take a look, we are at limit down this morning. We could see an even deeper selloff at the start of trading with the Dow Jones futures right now down 600 points, the Nasdaq futures down 191 and the S&amp;P futures currently lower by 71.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a sharp selloff by Friday capped off the worst week for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 since October 2008. Look at the week that was with the Dow Industrials down 4,000 points on the session. That's 17 percent on the week. The Nasdaq was down 995 points, 12 and a half percent lower, and the S&amp;P down 406 points, 15 percent lower on the week.</p><p>President Trump deploying the National Guard to New York, California and Washington state to fight what he calls the invisible enemy as more people are told they must stay home in these heavily-hit states.</p><p>More private companies stepping in the fight the war against coronavirus, meanwhile. They are working with the White House to manufacture must-needed supplies and medical equipment.</p><p>Plus, more businesses forced to shut down as tighter rules go into place. This week, St. Louis Federal Reserve president warning that the unemployment rate could soar to 30 percent.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Let's check global markets this morning because it is another selloff underway. Take a look at European indices right now with the FT 100 in London down 236 points, European indices red across the board. CAC quarante is down 150 points and the DAX index in Germany down 343 right now.</p><p>In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is in self-quarantine this morning after her doctor tests positive for coronavirus. The country banning groups of more than two people.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the Nikkei bucked the downward trend as optimism is growing there that the Summer Olympics will not be canceled but might be postponed. As you can see, the Nikkei average was up 2 percent but the other major averages down between three and 5.5 percent.</p><p>Oil prices also down this morning as demand decreases and the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia rages on. The price of oil now down 31 cents a barrel at $22.32 a barrel. The following -- it's one large -- the largest one-week percentage decline since January 1991. A tough week last week on the price of oil as we just watch it sit at $22 a barrel.</p><p>The yield on 10-years right now, take a look, down again. The 10-year Treasury is weaker by four basis points. It is sitting at 0.814 percent on the 10-year. Futures down drastically this morning on news out of Washington certainly. People are selling whatever they can sell, that includes stocks. Stocks plunging on the Senate -- as the Senate fails to agree on the coronavirus stimulus package.</p><p>Here's what we know. Democrats blocked the deal last night over how much money companies get versus the average American. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slamming his Democrats colleagues last night.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): We're fiddling here, fiddling with the emotions of the American people, fiddling with the markets, fiddling with our healthcare. The American people expect us to act tomorrow. And I want everybody to fully understand, if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it'll be because of our colleagues on the other side continues to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address this problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning on this top story, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell and PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>Good morning. Thank you so much for joining this conversation.</p><p>Mitch, Dagen, it is good to see you this Monday morning.</p><p>And, once again, yesterday, it was the Democrats saying that this is corporate welfare, Dagen, and businesses are shutting down, people are staying home and economic activity comes to a halt in America.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Passing this bailout, this help for individuals and corporations, is the difference between a dramatic downturn and a long-run depression. And I question whether the Democrats understand that.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi says that the House Democrats are planning to introduce their own legislation by getting involved in something that has been bipartisan negotiations in the Senate. It will drag this out and could significantly lengthen the time that it takes Congress to pass a bill.</p><p>What's at issue is the Democrats want -- are demanding to attach more burdens on businesses that borrow from the Federal Reserve in this package. That's according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page. They need to get this done and done quickly.</p><p>What's important in this, and we've talked about this for the last week, is that this allows -- it -- this bills appropriates almost half a trillion dollar to the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund that would then allow the Federal Reserve to lend or support businesses directly through the 13-3 section of the Federal Reserve Act. This is critical. Again, it's like individuals versus corporations and businesses. We need to keep companies solvent to prevent a banking crisis, to prevent layoffs to could go from a few million to tens of millions. I don't know if the Democrats understand the urgency of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they rejected -- they objected to the Republicans' plan to provide $500 billion for the Treasury to make loans, loan guaranties and investments to support business. They do not want it to look, Mitch, like you're helping business, even though it is business that is being told to shut down and it is business being told to tell their employees to go home and stay there.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: And what I don't understand is, businesses are the very enterprises that employ people. Like -- it's as if businesses are these profit machines that do nothing but bad when right now what we need is businesses to be propped up so they can continue to support the economy and pay people who may not be working because they're at home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Ryan Payne is with us. He's Payne Capital Management president. He is also joining the conversation.</p><p>And, Ryan, President Trump advised Americans to correct protocols during the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government's guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel and hand washing. Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet even as we are following all of the guidelines, Congress cannot get its act together. Senate Democrats are blocking this bill.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes, it's scary right now, Maria. At this point, obviously, businesses need a lifeline. And, again, with cash flow completely stopped for a lot of businesses right now, you know, we need to figure something out because the market's basically trading to the abyss.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In a market like this, where we're at limit down again, Ryan, what are you telling clients this morning? I mean you've got another 600 point decline right out of the gate this morning given the fact that we do not have any solutions here out of Washington?</p><p>Yes, I have a busy morning, Maria, that's for sure. But I think, you know, bottom line here is, look, we don't know where this thing's going to stop. Again, we don't know where this package is going to come in. And I think, you know, this is my third bear market now. The worst thing you can do here is panic because, again, you know, stock market prices are priced to the abyss right now. SO if you don't need liquidity right now and hopefully if you have cash you have bonds in your portfolio, you really don't want to touch your equities right now. You're not really selling into any sort of market at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria, I just want to add one quick thing before you get the news headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That every politician needs to listen to businesses, as well as the individuals who have suddenly, literally overnight lost their jobs. The CEO of Marriott, who -- the company furloughing two-thirds of the 4,000 corporate employees at its headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, the CEO saying this impact is worse than the 9/11 attacks and the financial crisis of 2008 combined. To put it in perspective, the urgency of getting something passed and getting money to individuals and loans, immediate loans to businesses of all sizes, what is in front of the Democrats in the Senate is a very good start in terms of the Treasury's ability to take about a half a trillion dollars, funnel it through the Federal Reserve and get loans to those in need immediately, businesses. They shouldn't have restriction. This is an unprecedented crisis this nation is facing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe when they see jobless claims number on Thursday, Dagen, maybe then they will understand what is happening across America. Since last week we had jobless claims numbers of 281,000, but this Thursday we are expecting jobless claims between 2 and 3 million, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by then it will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe that will get them to understand the importance.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By then it will be too late. Mark my words. Something needs to get done today or tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the end of this week, next week, it's too late for a lot of these businesses. They will be out of businesses.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There are -- there are business that need cash right now. And here is the latest on the coronavirus that we know.</p><p>President Trump has declared war on this virus, activating the National Guard in New York, in California and in Washington state. That to fight the spread of this highly contagious disease. The president saying yesterday governors will be in charge of the guard with FEMA covering all costs.</p><p>New York has the most cases of coronavirus in the country. The number nearing the 17,000 mark in New York. The death toll in New York right now, above 150. That is about 5 percent of coronavirus cases across the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel now in self-quarantine this morning after a doctor who gave her a vaccine tested positive for coronavirus. Her office says while the contact was brief, Merkel will remain isolated at home as a precaution. Officials say she is being tested right now.</p><p>The Summer Olympics losing two big competitors. Canada and Australia say they will not send athletes to Tokyo amid this coronavirus pandemic. The International Olympic Committee will decide whether to postpone the games. In the next four weeks we will know more. The Tokyo Olympics Committee president and the Japanese prime minister have said a delay may be, quote, inevitable. The games are schedule to start on July 24th.</p><p>And big tech companies this morning stepping up to fight coronavirus. The CEO's of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft detailing contributions, that include donations of medical supplies, supplies like masks, software to track the spread of the virus, as well as money. Microsoft President Brad Smith tweeted this, five pallets of personal protection equipment arrived last Friday as the company worked to get much-needed supplies to healthcare workers writes Brad Smith.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will join me live in the 8:00 a.m. hour this morning to talk more about the coronavirus stimulus package. Don't miss that.</p><p>And then, what is being done to keep the economy afloat? All that right here.</p><p>Back in a moment. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are selling off once again this morning. Take a look at futures, indicating a decline of 565 points. We are at limit down. The Dow reaching its lowest levels since 2017. And we will very likely see further losses when the opening bell rings this morning because we are at limit down right now.</p><p>Coronavirus also pushing the price of oil lower. Take a look. Oil obviously indicates a demand situation. You've got oil now at $22.30 a barrel, down 33 cents a barrel.</p><p>Mitch Roschelle and Dagen McDowell are in New York.</p><p>And, Mitch, you know, it's interesting to look at the oil market because on top of all of the worries about coronavirus and its impact in terms of weaker demand across the world, you are also seeing this fight with Russia -- between Russia and Saudi Arabia where Russia's plans really include killing off the U.S. shale industry with these prices.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, just -- it's like the last thing that that economy needs. And one of the other things, when you think about this stimulus package is, we've talked about all those businesses. There hasn't been enough discussion about the shale industry in the United States and what support they're going to need to get through this mess because the problems there really have nothing to do -- now with the coronavirus. It's about a fight between Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there is also a disagreement in terms of this strategy. You know, Dagen, you talked about that op-ed in \"The Journal\" the other day, rethinking the coronavirus strategy, and that keeps coming up.</p><p>St. Louis Federal Reserve James Bullard out with an alarming prediction. He says that the U.S. unemployment rate could hit 30 percent in the second quarter due to the virus, and that is one reason that you have people like Steve Bannon yesterday on my show on Fox News says shut the country down. We're going to be talking with Bill Ackman coming up. He is also of that sentiment thinking, look, you need to take a break, 30 days, shut everybody down, flood the country with cash. We are talking about that in a moment with Phil to talk about putting money to work.</p><p>But what's your take in terms of the strategy today and what this looks like when we get through this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The problem with -- that you're seeing in the markets is anybody investing can't see the other side of it. They can't really see even the next few days. So the president, we're talking about a 15-day period that started last week. Many people think it will go a great deal longer than that and then you will have, say, the governor of New York talking about months and months and months that it's going to take and it's -- it's a great burden on our leaders, whether it's a state level or the national level to give some certainty to this -- to businesses who are trying to still operate, to individuals, to anyone in this country. And this is what happens.</p><p>One thing that needs to be certain is the amount of money going to individuals immediately, but also the lending that the Federal Reserve could do and the backstops it could put in place to support this economy and this grave period in our history. And that's what the holdup is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We -- you know, we're going to know whether or not this strategy is working.</p><p>Chad Wolf, the Homeland Security secretary, came on yesterday and said, we will have enough data by mid-April, end of April, to know if this actually worked in terms of shutting down various states. But there are people who want a complete shutdown.</p><p>Bill Ackman is going to be joining us in the next hour to talk about that. And that's exactly what Steve Bannon said yesterday, that the country needs to be flooded with cash and we are not seeing the kind of urgency that we need. We certainly didn't see the urgency from -- from Democrats last night, Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, 100 percent. And lost in this conversation too, not our conversation but the one that the Senate was having is all of the small businesses. And I've spent a lot of time in the last two weeks speaking to small business owners and trying to empathize with them and feeling their pain and helping advice some of them. And there's 60 million people in this country employed by small businesses right now that are just choked off. They -- and have no lifeline. And we have to do something right now to get small businesses to continue to pay their employees and to stay afloat so they'll be in business on the other side of this whenever that is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, we want to take a look at oil, interest rates, and, of course, the stock market.</p><p>Stay with us. More MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Protecting the United States from coronavirus and bad information. This weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES, I spoke with acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, who told us about all of the border closings. He also said, while there is not a full shutdown on the U.S. on the agenda right now, officials are working hard to combat misinformation about potential moves.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is the president considering a full shutdown of the country for a period of time, sir?</p><p>CHAD WOLF, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Not -- not at this time. The president, again, though the vice president and the task force has been very aggressive and very forward-leaning and providing a number of guidance, a number of information to the American public. We have the 15 days to slow the spread.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know there's a disinformation campaign coming out of China, but when people see reports it may very well be cyber fraud, right?</p><p>WOLF: Absolutely. We've seen a number of reports, and I've personally gotten contact a number of times about text messages or these screenshots going around saying that I know someone at DHS and they say we're going to have a national lockdown or a national quarantine. And I would just say that's absolutely false. It's not true. And it is part of a disinformation campaign.</p><p>And what we know, whether it's Russia or whether it's other cyber actors --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: They like to sew discord on any controversial issue. So it doesn't just have to be elections. It can be any issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: And we're seeing that now with the coronavirus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: No surprise that Russia is behind this, as well as China.</p><p>I'm with Dagen, Mitch, and Ryan this morning. And, you know, Mitch, we may be getting this bad information and cyber fraud from Russia, but anyway you look at it, you are talking about a country that is standing still. People would like to see even more of this. New York and California lockdown overnight beginning at 8:00 in New York and California has been in that settle at home state. It certainly feels that way, but people would like to see even more.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, and the economic cost --</p><p>BARTIROMO: For a period of time.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right. And the economic cost of that and the uncertainty surrounding that is the thing that has the market completely on meltdown mode.</p><p>Just on the cybersecurity point, I -- I worry about this because I think American businesses and consumers are incredibly vulnerable right now to cybersecurity risk and I think, you know, we're probably not as vigilant as we should be, but not it's going to be very hard to be vigilant when we're so compromised.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria, a few days --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's no surprise that it's -- yes, these out -- these bad actors piling on the United States now, knowing that we are at such a critical point, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. A few days ago Defense Department officials were warning, and this is based on Jennifer Griffin's reporting from the news channel, planting online rumors that the federal government was going to impose marshal law and the National Guard was being called upon to enforce it. Online trolling, online lies from foreign bad actors.</p><p>But one thing I want to stress, the reason that a broader kind of stay at home order for other states, other than say California and New York, the two largest, might be needed is because people are not following guidelines.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You had people in Washington, D.C., in the last few days, going to see the cherry blossoms. You saw it here in New York City before they had to shut down the bars and restaurants a week ago, a little more than a week ago, people were flooding bars and restaurants despite being told by the governor and federal officials that you shouldn't congregate in crowds.</p><p>So that's the issue is people are not following recommendations. They're not staying at home. Even yesterday the -- New York city is full of people and you have the governor here is now having to impose some distancing for parks in the city and throughout the state. It's really incredible that people don't understand the seriousness of this until they have loved ones who get sick and are on respirators in hospitals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I 100 percent agree with you, Dagen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not to mention all of the partying going on in Florida and elsewhere with the spring breakers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The spring breakers, but it's also adults. We can no longer blame the ignorance and -- of youth on this. Again, you -- the people in national parks out in Arizona. Meghan McCain had to do an interviews on radio and television in Arizona telling people to stay at home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, Dagen, I 100 percent agree with you on this. This is a big, big problem. And that's one of the reasons why I think we should just completely shut the country down and just completely, you know, cut this off at the knees. If we don't, it's just going to keep lingering. And that's the biggest risk we have right now, 100 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean that's what Steve Bannon had said and that's what he said yesterday and that's what we're going to hear from Bill Ackman coming up.</p><p>We've got some very important interviews coming up. And I'll ask Steven Mnuchin about this. The Treasury secretary will be coming up on this program live. We will ask him how this strategy is working and whether or not we do need to see a much more aggressive shutdown across the country.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, how top medical officials are working to narrow in on treatment for coronavirus. Stay with us. We are looking at hope in the pharma sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, March 23, your top stories right now, 6:31 am on the East Coast.</p><p>Coronavirus stimulus stalling in the Senate last night. The uncertainty over the nearly $2 trillion package sending markets plummeting this morning. Take a look. Futures indicating a decline of 530 points right now, with the Dow down to 18,500. Just think, we were at 2,900 a week ago, or two weeks ago.</p><p>The Nasdaq down 171 points right now, at 67.95 and the S&amp;P down 66 at 22.22. This on top of a sharp sell-off on Friday. Friday's sell-off capped off the worst week for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 since October of 2008.</p><p>Let's check global markets this morning. We've got a similar sentiment there, with the European indexes down across the board. Take a look at the FTSE 100, down 218 points. The (inaudible) CRONS in Paris down 126 and the DAX index in 311 points. We are expecting jobless claims numbers to rise significantly this upcoming Thursday.</p><p>In German, Chancellor Angela Merkel is in self-quarantine this morning, after her doctor tested positive for coronavirus. The country banning groups of more than two people in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the Nikkei bucked the trend in Japan as optimism grew that the summer Olympics may not be canceled. But, it might be postponed, certainly. And I have two major interviews coming up. So, tune-in, we have important interviews to share with you. Pershing Square's Bill Ackman is here and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here.</p><p>Bill Ackman is calling for a full shutdown of the country. We will see what Steven Mnuchin says about that, and what the Treasury Secretary has to say about that Senate bill stalling last night.</p><p>When we see money go to the individuals and businesses who need it.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are targeting a treatment. Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing New York will begin drug trials for an anti-malaria coronavirus treatment beginning tomorrow. At a news conference yesterday the Governor sounded confident in the drug's potential, saying this, \"The president is optimistic about these drugs and we are all optimistic that it could work.\"</p><p>My next guest is on the front lines of the coronavirus fight. Joining us right now is CityMD Medical Director for emergency and family medicine, Fox News Medical Contributor, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Janette, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you confident in this anti-malaria drug? Right now we're talking about anti-virals that some of which are already on the market, but perhaps could be used for a dual use. What can you tell us?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, Maria, I'm very hopeful. This gives us some insight that these anti-viral medicines might work and might save lives. Now, this medication, Hydroxychloroquine, also know as Plaquenil, it's not new. It's been around since 1995, originally to be used and still being used to treat Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and even malaria.</p><p>So, the way it works is, it down regulates the inflammatory response of our immune system so that our body doesn't overreact when it sees a pathogen. Like, for example, the coronavisus, so that you don't have massive inflammation and fluid build-up in your lungs.</p><p>So, this medicine Plaquenil along with Azithromycin has been show in a small study, in a small French study, that it may reduce the duration of symptoms and could potentially save lives.</p><p>So, I am also hopeful and optimistic, but we do need to run these tests, because we need to check for safety and efficacy, because these medicines do have side effects. For example, both of these medicines can cause an irregular beating of your heart and then some other mild side effects. But, they do have to be tested for this specific virus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, at this point we're talking about a treatment, we're talking about a treatment, anti-virals used to treat coronavirus.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A vaccine, we're still talking about a year, year and a half away, correct?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, correct. And the vaccine has already began, first dose has already been given. The second dose will be given day 28. These patients, these volunteers, bless their hearts, are going to be followed and monitored and hopefully by the end of this year, early next year, we'll have this vaccine on the market.</p><p>Because, studies have shown, vaccines save lives and can prevent millions of unwanted complications and hospitalizations. So, that's down the road. That's not going to help us acutely, but what will help us acutely is if everyone together, collectively, adheres to the strict guidelines, protocols and recommendations of the CDC to stay home, especially if you're sick, coughing into your arm, taking precautions being around other people.</p><p>And even if you have no symptoms, it's so important and critical to understand that you can pass and transmit this virus to other people, and some of those other people may be vulnerable people, on chemotherapy, or have heart failure or on dialysis. So, it's not just about protecting yourself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: It's about protecting your neighbor and coming together as a society and unifying, so that we can overcome this virus sooner than later.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mea, with -- when this started it was about the elderly for this reason. I mean, the start of this pandemic, it was the elderly who were the most vulnerable to contracting this virus. But recently, we've actually seen an abundance of young people now being hospitalized for coronavirus.</p><p>One example is this 12-year-old girl in Georgia. She was hospitalized, she's on a ventilator after being diagnosed with coronavirus.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, why are we seeing this sudden increase in younger patients? Are they able to recover more quickly than those who are older? So, talk to us about who this is hitting now. And were we wrong to think it was the elderly really the most vulnerable.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: You're absolutely right. That's a great point, Maria. The data initially that we had came out of China and it did show that many of those with the serious complications were older, elderly people with underlying medical problems.</p><p>But, I am seeing it in the younger population. Everyone is at risk. But, usually, traditionally, those who are younger, I mean, their lungs aren't exposed to pollutants. And it also has to do with genetics and your biology.</p><p>But just last night, for example, I had a somewhat younger patient, only 31-years-old with difficulty breathing. He had a pneumonia. Last week I had another younger patient in her early 20s --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: -- she just couldn't catch her breath. She couldn't breath. And it's heartbreaking, because you want to do everything you can to help them, and -- but you're limited. You're limited to inhalers and breathing treatments and that sort of thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: So, yes, it can affect everyone and that's why we all have to take precautions, not only to protect ourselves, but to help prevent the spread of this virus, to minimize the impact on the emergency rooms, on the hospitals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Janette, I want to ask you two questions before you go --</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- because you just talked about that strain on hospitals. Are you worried that we are facing -- the hospital industry, it's on the brink of breaking? Someone told me the other day that we were just hours away from no more beds and no more ventilators. That hospitals cannot even handle heartaches and strokes because they're so overrun with coronavirus cases.</p><p>I want you to address that, and I also want to ask you to give our viewers notes on how to build a stronger immune system, because we all need to build a stronger immune system right now to be able to handle what is obviously coming at us.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, it -- I am concerned, Maria, I am. I'm worried about PPEs. I'm worried are we going to run out of masks, are we going to run out of staff that get sick that have to be on quarantine. Are we going to run out of supplies?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And just to be clear, PPE is the protective gear? The PPE is the protective gear that nurses and doctors need?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, ma'am. Right. Right. Are masks, so that we don't get sick. Because if we get sick, then we're on quarantine, how are we going to take care of our patients.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: So, masks, gowns, gloves. This is of great concern, but New York State, as of yesterday, we're declared an emergency to get extra funding to get help, to have these resources, to have these tools so we can help fight this virus. But, it is very important. We're seeing a strain on -- on the emergency rooms and the hospitals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: And that's why it's so important for patients to really, truly understand that everyone, one person can truly have an impact. If you're just having mild symptoms, stay home. The -- you know, coming in to try to be tested just for peace of mind right now is not going to make a life changing difference. And it's hard to get younger patients and sometimes the older ones--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: -- who are just under a lot of stress and anxiety--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick--</p><p>NESHEIWAT: -- to understand this. Yes?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, give us a couple of tips on strength and error immune systems, Janette--</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- real quick before you go.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Good well balanced diet, you get plenty of vitamins and minerals from fruits and vegetables, stay hydrated, no smoking, make sure you're up to date with all your routine vaccines. That can help keep you healthy.</p><p>And you know what; it's not a bad idea to take a multivitamin. Zinc has been shown to help fight viral replication and vitamin D has also been shown to help against respiratory--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: -- infections if you start it in advance of the disease.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Janette, thank you so much. Great advice. Dr. Janette--</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Nesheiwat, we will see you soon. Thank you. Just want to point out markets here because we are down 400 plus points. But Boeing shares are up; the stock is rallying about 1 percent on an upgrade this morning. But the company is also making some serious moves. We're going to take a look at that and come back with that.</p><p>But I want to bring you Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arriving in Afghanistan overnight on a surprise visit. Cheryl Casone on that right now with detail, Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. We've been following the Secretary of State. He is in Kabul right now. He's trying to move forward that peace deal between the United States and the Taliban. The agreement signed last month but internal politics ha snow threatened any progress.</p><p>The Taliban and the Afghani government discussed the prisoner release agreement which is a major sticking point right now. Pompeo did meet with Afghanistan's president and will meet the opposition leader who also claims to be the president of the country. That's all going to happen later this morning. We're following that.</p><p>Now to IBM and Honeywell, they have now joined the fight with the White House against the coronavirus. President Trump says that IBM along with a group of top universities and labs will use super computers to help researchers understand the virus and look for potential treatments and cures. You've got Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p><p>They're also working with this consortium. And as you can see those are the stocks right now and those red arrows across the board. Honeywell though guys is ramping up production of personal protection equipment. Their goal is to make millions as you've talked about those N95 masks. We need a lot more of those, folks.</p><p>Well, Cisco is pledging $225 million to help combat the global coronavirus outbreak the company offering $8 million in cash, $210 million out in services. They're expected to announce a multimillion dollar financial assistance program for at risk individuals (inaudible).</p><p>The stock is down more than 1.5 percent in the free market. And finally, Maria, there was a raise. There was a flag, just no physical fans. Denny Hamlin captured the virtual checkered flag at the eNASCAR iRacing pro invitational series.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN MALE: They all but some together and the winner is Hamlin.</p><p>UNKNOWN MALE: Wow. What a race. What a finish. Wow, what a race--</p><p>CASONE: (Inaudible) is there, Maria.</p><p>UNKNOWN MALE: -- on the final lap off of turn two side by side.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: You can see all the empty stands obviously in the video. Hamlin, (inaudible), Earnhardt Jr. on a digital version of homestead Miami Speedway. This is something else. Hamlin got to do something he normally doesn't do. He got to race barefooted home.</p><p>The NASCAR season is on hold until at least May amid the coronavirus pandemic. Until then there's going to be an iRace Maria every week more and more, we're all trying to find things to do to well, pass the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's great. Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then we've got a lot more, the impact of coronavirus on markets getting hitting hard. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures are pointing to a sharp sell of this morning, take a look. The Dow is reaching its lowest level since 2017.</p><p>We continue to see investors react to a failure yesterday in the Senate and continuation of closings across the country. Coronavirus also pushing the price of oil lower, take a look at oil prices this morning. And even safe havens are being sold in this market like gold.</p><p>Take a look, oil prices down $0.14 a barrel at $22.49 right now. Joining me right now is Federated Hermes Chief Equity Strategist Phil Orlando. And Phil, it is great to get your insights this morning. What have we lost so far in terms of market value and how much lower can this market go, Phil?</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, FEDERATED HERMES CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST: Well, we're down about 35 percent from that market high we saw in February '19. And in terms of where's the bottom? How low is low? We've been slicing through technical levels like a hot knife through butter.</p><p>In terms of fundamentals, given the complete lack of visibility here companies have full (inaudible) rightly so. So, it's very difficult to look at the market in a traditional sense to figure out the bottom which is why we have come up with (inaudible) this three-legged tool (ph) idea to try to figure out where the bottom is.</p><p>Developments in monetary policy, fiscal policy and social policy when we can the check the boxes in all three of those then we'll have some comfort levels that we're at or near bottom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, you don't have any visibility in the face of St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard out with an alarming prediction saying that U.S. unemployment could hit 30 percent, Phil, in the second quarter due to this virus.</p><p>You also have Bank of America saying to expect up to three million jobless claims when we get the weekly numbers on Thursday. Last week was 281,000.</p><p>We're talking about three million perhaps this upcoming Thursday. Are these things priced into the market or when you see this would investors see these kinds of numbers in the second quarter. Will they be surprised and send this market even lower?</p><p>ORLANDO: I think a lot of this has been priced in but I've got to tell you if you look back at the last cycle, the great recession cycle, we (inaudible) claims somewhere in that 650 to 700,000 neighborhood.</p><p>If we start pruning a million, two million, three million claims and Mnuchin talked about unemployment going to 20 percent. Bullard's talking about 30 percent. I mean those are massive numbers.</p><p>And that brings us back to the point of if these are the kinds of numbers, the kind of damage we're talking about what was the sort of thinking last night in terms of failing to pass that bill. So, this is one of the key issues here. Monetary policy I think we can all--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ORLANDO: -- agree that the Fed's all in but fiscal policy; it seems as if they're still playing games in Washington. This is very--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. As--</p><p>ORLANDO: -- (inaudible), Maria, of what happened with Tarp (ph)--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ORLANDO: -- back in 2008. We got the misstep.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is.</p><p>ORLANDO: The market dropped another 5 or 10 percent and then that was the- -</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>ORLANDO: -- wake up call for Congress to come back and say OK, now we've got to get serious. That's where I think we are this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. Ryan Pain (ph), you were there. You remember when we were in desperate need of a package and they were fighting over Tarp (ph). Same thing once again, the country is in desperation needing cash and they're fighting over line items.</p><p>ORLANDO: It's a serious problem. We've got to get some leadership I think in Washington and we've got to get both parties on the same page. And like you said Maria--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ORLANDO: -- they're bickering over change in the couch cushions in terms of the need to push.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>ORLANDO: We need a couple of trillion dollars here well directed in phase three and then there's going to be a phase four and there's going to be a phase five but we've got to get some action this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. Thank you so much, Phil. We will keep checking back with you certainly to see how your clients are doing in this with the Dow industrials down 400 right now.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back Hollywood and the celebrity world, how they are looking to help amid the coronavirus crisis. Stay with us.</p><p>Welcome back. Well celebrities now taking action amid the coronavirus pandemic. Carley Shimkus has the details on that angle. Carly, good morning.</p><p>CARLY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning Maria. Celebrities are flooding social media with pictures and videos, all aimed at getting folks to sanitize and stay indoors.</p><p>Neil Diamond serenading his Twitter followers with an acoustic performance of \"Sweet Caroline,\" but this version has a unique twist. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEIL DIAMOND, SINGER: (Singing). Hands, washing hands, reaching out, don't touch me, I won't touch you. Sweet Caroline.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Well, that video racking up nearly four million views on Twitter. Meantime, DJ D-Nice gave millennials a reason to stay at home this weekend. The Bronx native posted a -- posted a virtual dance party on Instagram, called hashtag, Club Quarantine.</p><p>It drew over 100,000 viewers, including celebrities and politicians, like Missy Elliott, Michelle Obama, even Joe Biden. D-Nice himself even blown away with it's success, writing, I never would have imagined that the best party I would create and DJ would be from the comfort of my own home.</p><p>Country music star Garth Brooks offering a free concert that will stream on Facebook Live and he is currently taking song requests under the hashtag, Garth request live. The concert will kick off tonight at 7:00 pm Eastern time.</p><p>And the show will also go on at the Grand Ole Opry, without an audience though. The venue will now stream their concerts every Saturday. A tradition that's been going on for 94 years. So, Maria, a whole host of celebrities providing at-home entertainment to keep people occupied.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. You've got to love America.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The American will get through this hook or crook.

PragerU lost the case, however, after U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh ruled in favor of Google, saying the company is private and therefore not subject to the same regulations as state actors.</p><p>On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco dismissed the media organization's subsequent appeal, agreeing with Koh's ruling that the platform is private and could impose restrictions and content filtration, including demonetizing content as it sees fit. </p><p>\"YouTube does not perform a public function by inviting public discourse on its property,\" wrote Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown in her brief. \"To characterize YouTube as a public forum would be a paradigm shift.\"</p><p>PragerU took specific issue with YouTube's restricted content filter, which flagged videos that included alcohol abuse, sexual situations, violence, and other mature situations. The organization's content featured none such content but was still flagged for \"objectionable content\" by the company's algorithm. The videos were then reviewed by humans, who often upheld the content restriction and, in addition, demonetized videos, making it difficult for PragerU to leverage the platform for moneymaking opportunities. </p><p>\"Although PragerU\u2019s content has received over 2 billion views, many of PragerU\u2019s videos are being blocked and categorized as 'objectionable content,'\" read a statement posted to PragerU's website. </p><p>Censorship of conservative voices on social media has been a hot-button issue since major platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have banned a number of high-profile right-wing accounts. </p><p>iFrame Object</p><p>Photo Caption:Dennis Prager attends Politicon at The Pasadena Convention Center on Sunday, Aug. 30, 2017, in Pasadena, Calif.

Namely, whether it's a newer venture or a well-known, established brand.</emphasis></p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When I joined my agency as a young recruit back in the day, I took on clients ranging from data storage and software startups to Swedish telecom giant Ericsson.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each had their challenges, but one was notably different. The pitches for the start-ups required a great deal of trial and error. After banging my head against a wall, I'd shift gears to Ericsson. Phone conversations with reporters felt more like banter with old friends (once we got past the awkward \"Oh, you're a PR guy\" stage). A typical response was: \"Right, Ericsson, let me try to fit you in.\" Chasing stories down for other clients made me feel more like an annoying bill collector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was a long time ago, and much has changed in the technology and public relations worlds. One thing remains the same, however: success hinges on very different playbooks for established brands versus startups. Below, I'll explain how this plays out and how to stack the deck-or stack the tech-depending on which side your company or client falls out on.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The power of brand</emphasis></h><p>Technology dominates our lives and the headlines. Nine out of 10 companies in the NASDAQ 100 are in tech, from old school vendors like Microsoft and Intel to relative newcomers like Facebook and Amazon. Unicorns-young, private companies valued at over $1 billion-dominate their sectors and command outsize attention.</p><p>It's a winner take all world in business, and this applies to media coverage too. Big news about recognized companies and brands still ranks the highest on the press attention scale.</p><p>So, if you're a big tech brand, you're all set, right? And startups should just pack their bags and go home?</p><p>Not at all. The primacy of brand is a double-edged sword. Well-known brands come with associations, sometimes, less than glowing. There can be baggage that needs to be overcome, and this isn't necessarily easy, given the inertia. Think of how hard it is for a large ship to shift course. A large brand can be a major target for a looming crisis.</p><p>The startup's brand can be viewed as a blank canvas, waiting to be filled in. Their challenge is to overcome the initial reluctance and natural skepticism about something new and unproven.</p><p>Inevitably it gets to games of defense vs. offense.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Defense vs. offense</emphasis></h><p>The tech leaders have much working for them, such as recognition and market power. Their business challenges typically involve defending turf, growing market share and conquering new areas. PR needs to support each of these.</p><p>The programs should focus on reputation, crisis management-when necessary-and news about business progress and product and business lines. In short, it's primarily a defensive game and needs to heed vulnerabilities such as any baggage related to their brand or space (think of cable companies and customer service, or social media platforms and consumer privacy).</p><p>The PR team should explore tactics to counter these issues. This could mean finding ways to rebuff unwanted media inquiries for certain topics and pursuing those that are more strategic.</p><p>Startups face different challenges and need to play offense. This means taking risks and being bold to fight for attention. New can mean newsworthy. Disruption, taking on the giants: these are appealing storylines. Plus, there's an affinity for the entrepreneur, and a natural rooting for the underdog.</p><p>The new ventures, the lesser-known competitors should launch communications aimed at the weaknesses of the leaders to get coverage. A tried and true tactic in technology is sowing FUD: fear, uncertainty and doubt.</p><p>In addition to taking more risks, start-ups can use their small size to advantage. For example, they can be nimbler when responding to news and marketplace developments. Big brands can be constrained by bureaucracy and disclosure regulations governing public companies.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Executive branding</emphasis></h><p>There are parallels between the challenges and opportunities of big brands and the profiles of their leadership. Indeed, it can be hard to separate a well-known leader from the company brand. Think Larry Ellison at Oracle, Marc Benioff at Salesforce, and Elon Musk at Tesla.</p><p>Having a celebrity CEO can seem to be an unfair advantage. And this may be true, depending on the personal brand of the executive. Some are loose cannons that create more PR damage than windfall. We saw this recently with the WeWork IPO flameout, when CEO Adam Neumann was regarded as a hero, until he wasn't.</p><p>The startup with the unknown executive team needs to work hard to earn attention and build a brand for its leaders. This can involve thought leadership programs, especially in the B2B sector.</p><p>The PR teams at larger companies should understand the strengths and weaknesses of the public faces and do their best to mitigate problems by counseling on talking points, when to engage the media, when to shun the spotlight or sometimes, the best way to apologize.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't fear the techlash</emphasis></h><p>It's hard to ignore the growing technology backlash, or techlash. People fret about habit-forming apps and social media, and news and algorithmic bias and manipulation. Governments around the world are clamping down to fight against monopolies and protect consumer privacy. Reporters are editorializing with harsher tones in their articles.</p><p>How to respond? Again, this can vary based on the type of company. Big tech is taking the brunt of the criticism, especially the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Their PR teams are doing their best to fight the fires, but many of the problems they endure are systemic and won't go away overnight.</p><p>This doesn't mean that smaller companies get a free pass. They can get dinged too. One of our startup clients was called out as a violator of consumer privacy by TechCrunch, and several other publications ran articles quoting the TechCrunch article. We felt the company was unfairly singled out, as others offer similar functionality which can, in fact, expose personal information, if implemented incorrectly. On the other hand, the TechCrunch piece positioned our client as de facto leaders in the space and thrust the company onto the world stage. We took it as an opportunity to go on the offensive, and issued a statement that countered the inaccuracies in the article. Several outlets published it verbatim.</p><p>The PR team went out with a pitch about the problem and explained the benefits of the technology. The client's CEO was eager to get out there and educate about their technology, damn the torpedoes. This aggressive approach resulted in interviews and coverage with many top-tier outlets.</p><p>A larger company might not have been able to respond as quickly or be as eager to go on the offensive about such a sensitive issue.</p><p>Despite the techlash, I feel that tech PR is still a great place to be and will be for years to come. You just need to apply the right tactics for the type of company and technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, Bob Geller</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSRVS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSRVS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFJ-C9C1-JC8V-42HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1138\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 J.R.

In his prescient 1962 book Profiles of the Future Clarke predicted that by 2040 we will have made contact with extra-terrestrials. According to the 2001: A Space Odyssey author, about 30 years later we will have mastered near light speed travel (bets on Bezos or Musk?) and by 2080 we will be ready for interstellar flight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Preposterous, I hear you mutter, these are no more than the fevered dreams of a science fiction writer. On the other hand Clarke predicted the digital age: communication satellites, the personal computer, internet search, touchscreen devices, and even smart watches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What makes one person ideally suited to these apparent powers of prediction while the rest of us are left in the dark? Is it possible to learn to think like a futurist? Clarke himself said: \"Before one attempts to set up in business as a prophet, it is instructive to see what success others have made of this dangerous occupation - and it is even more instructive to see where they have failed.\" Which reminds me, Clarke also had a few stinkers including flying houses that he envisioned we would all have by 2001. These houses would even fly south for the winter.</p><p>This is not trying to make light of his obvious intellect but rather making the point that predicting the future is less about being Nostradamus than it is about coming up with multiple future scenarios based on what you know about the past and present. </p><p>It's not an exact science, it's more like probabilistic forecasting. If you want to get into this headspace there are several online courses you can take including Practicing Exponential Foresight at Singularity University (SU), which was co-founded by Ray Kurzweil, inventor, director of engineering at Google, and renowned futurist.</p><p>Kurzweil himself has made quite a few accurate predictions including: facial recognition software, digital downloads, machine translation and smart home assistants. Others are coming to pass now including exoskeletal robotic walkers for people with spinal injuries while yet more are potentially on the horizon. In 2005 he predicted a new world in the 2040s where the technological singularity will occur, bringing the dawn of a new super-advanced machine age where artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence. </p><p>Joel Hobbs runs the forecasting course at SU and says all kinds of people come looking to learn these skills ranging from engineers working at big tech companies to entrepreneurs looking for the next big opportunity, academics, and those looking to change the world in a philanthropic sense: predicting what kinds of technologies could help tackle global hunger and clean drinking water or how a shifting socio-political landscape can impact upon climate change.</p><h>Forecasting skills</h><p>These forecasting skills include knowing the difference between what they call hard and soft trends. Hard trends are \"knowns\" and include scientific facts or laws and regulations, whereas soft trends are \"unknowns\", assumptions like how a company might react to laws and regulations or how a country might chose to deal (or not deal) with scientific facts such as climate change. </p><p>Peter Diamandis, a co-founder of SU, says: \"It's essential to separate out what is really true, from what is opinion, and what is merely guessing. If you can better understand what is certain and uncertain, how would that change your perspective of the future?\"</p><p>\"Futurists aren't really predicting the future per se. They're looking at hard trends and saying: if this continues, this is what we're going to see, and here are some other curve balls that could come at us. Forecasting is less about looking into a crystal ball and more about just looking at the evidence that you have in front of you in a clear way,\" explains Hobbs.</p><p>But surely if you're an expert in your field you are already best placed to predict future scenarios? How would these exponential foresight skills improve upon established expertise? Well, things can change unexpectedly when a new technology disrupts the status quo.</p><h>Convergence </h><p>Hobbs gives the example of how Netflix and its ilk changed the movie rental industry: \"Let's say I knew everything there was to know about running a Blockbuster video store, I would have be blindsided because I didn't know anything about the internet, right? One of the interesting things we're seeing is this convergence of industries and technologies - no one person can really hold all the domain knowledge anymore.\"  </p><p>And so you can see how forecasting becomes of interest to those who have seen how disruption not only killed the video star but has utterly changed the music and newspaper industries, bricks and mortar shops, banking and finance, even the restaurant as delivery services have taken hold. If we didn't see internet shopping, streaming services or digital subscriptions coming, what else are we failing to predict?</p><p>\"The more you want to understand about the future, the more you have to make some judgment calls about what you think is going to happen and we talk about that in terms of variables,\" explains Hobbs.</p><p>\"There are variables in terms of what society will do, what the technology will do and what the environment is doing. You try and put those altogether and come up with a scenario. Scenario planning is about looking at not just one scenario but at multiple scenarios that could occur.\"</p><p>According to Hobbs this is less about saying \"I know the future\" and more about saying \"I know the things that are very likely possible and I'm going to be ready for that\". He says this isn't just about Silicon Valley hopefuls looking to crack the next huge trend. Forecasting the impact of emerging technologies may help prevent scenarios like the Cambridge Analytica scandal because governments and citizens can spot potentially harmful scenarios on the horizon.</p><p>\"One of the things we try to convey in the course is that we believe that these technologies, because they're getting cheaper and more ubiquitous, can be democratised. But there's a danger that certain companies or governments that don't have our best interests at heart can get monopolies on a technology or have control of the most powerful AI and really bad things could happen.\"</p><p>\"We're trying to educate people and get them interested in these things because there are some really challenging ethical issues that are facing us in the not too distant future. And because right now, governments are slow to understand and react or when they do it's not necessarily in a positive manner.\"</p><h>Gene editing</h><p> Hobbs warns that if citizens don't start demanding proper accounting for different technologies, from AI to medical technologies including gene editing, a future we don't want will unfold without our consent or knowledge.  </p><h>Jamie Susskind is also concerned with the future, specifically the future of power, liberty, democracy and justice in a shifting digital landscape where we place our data in the hands of big tech companies and our lives are increasingly being shaped by algorithms. The </h><p>barrister and author set out to develop a framework for understanding the consequences of digital innovation by drawing on political theory. Incidentally his father Richard and brother Daniel co-wrote The Future of Professions so futurology runs in the family.</p><p>In his book Future Politics he says: \"I believe it is possible to make sensible, informed guesses about what the future might look like, based on what we know of the current trends in science, technology, and politics. The biggest risk would be not to try to anticipate the future at all.\"</p><p>Susskind was compelled to explore how the future will play out in the face of three key areas of technological change - machines becoming more capable; technology becoming more distributed in the home and built environment, and increasing amounts of data being gathered about us.</p><p>\"I think on all three fronts, change continues apace. What is interesting is that when I started writing the book - it sounds naive now - but I was genuinely concerned that people wouldn't immediately see the importance of the idea that digital is political. That was back in 2015/2016 and since then it's not out of the news every single day,\" says Susskind.</p><p>One important theme in his book is that of freedom and how technology can both positively and negatively impact upon our freedom of action and thought. Susskind marries this to the notion of law enforcement in a future state with the technological power to detect and prevent most legal transgressions.</p><p>Most of us have strayed into what Susskind refers to as the \"precious hinterland of naughtiness\" at one time or another: sampled grapes at the supermarket, dodged a bus fares or perhaps streamed an episode of a TV show that we haven't paid for. He asks how our day-to-day freedoms will change when there isn't even an option to transgress: an alarm sounds if a grape is lifted from the bunch, fares are automatically deducted from a digital wallet as we step onto the bus, and digital rights management locks down all digital content.</p><p>\"I certainly think that the future of freedom as things stand will be significantly determined by entities in the private sector and not through public discourse and debate. And I don't think it's ineluctable. I don't think it's unpreventable but that is the current trajectory that we are on,\" he adds.</p><p>Whatever happened to the utopian future dreamed up by early users of the web who thought technology would democratise everything and put everyone on equal footing? \"I think the truth about techno-utopianism is that you can't rely on technology to change us. At least not in a simple unidirectional way,\" explains Susskind.</p><h>'Concerted effort' </h><p>\"We have to make a concerted effort to channel technologies in a particular way and so long as we allow - as we currently do - digital technologies to develop by reference to the principles of the free market and capitalism, you are not going to get results that are good for public policy or good for democracy or rather, there's no inherent reason why we would get those results. You might sometimes, but the system is shaping these technologies is capitalist rather than democratic in nature,\" he says.  </p><p>This is quite a lot to process for several generations brought up to get excited about and consume new technologies. Technological innovations such as the PC, internet, iPhone, social media or the smart home weren't shaping the future - they were the future. We bought into the dream of literally being able to buy the future as if it were nothing more than a hot commodity.</p><p>Susskind says if you have one takeaway from his book it is this: \"Treat technology as a citizen and not just as a consumer. If we all do that we can change the course of the future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3816988</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VK8-FMW1-DYS1-02PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Stuart Kennedy reports</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THIS year promises to be the time when Australia's biggest enterprises try to exorcise the ghosts of their mainframe pasts: those big, ugly, scary legacy applications that have been haunting their tech operations for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All eyes will be on Telstra as it labours on the massive technology overhaul ordained by the telco's new North American managers, headed up by chief amigo Sol Trujillo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Greg Winn, the amigo in charge of Telstra's operations, has ordered a search-and-destroy mission on the telco's 1200 different technology systems.</p><p>Calling the mess ''the root of all evil in the telco industry'' Winn read the riot act to Telstra's tech people late last year. ''We're going to be absolutely ruthless in our pursuit of decommissioning systems and the first software developer or code writer that even attempts to modify a piece of software will be doing something else for a living -- hopefully working for one of our competitors and screwing up their technology systems.''</p><p>Former Qantas CIO Fiona Balfour, who has just signed on as tech chief at Telstra, will have a whole new set of legacy applications to fret over, after famously telling a conference crowd last year that the old code at Qantas, some of which dates back to the 1960s, ''kept her awake at night''.</p><p>Australian CIOs sitting on top of legacy application time-bombs of their own will no doubt be following the exploits of Winn and Balfour with keen interest.</p><p>Elsewhere, National Australia Bank CIO Michelle Tredenick will be watched by the nation's CIO club as she grapples with her part of a three-year, $1.8 billion technology makeover.</p><p>Tredenick, who is in the process of staffing up for the reform program, worries there may be a shortage of talent to choose from.</p><p>''Acquiring technology talent and skills is a key success factor,'' she says. ''I don't have any concerns in the current market, although I do see some areas of skill shortage looming.''</p><p>Tredenick says she may also look to the local and offshore outsourcing markets for extra hands. Coles Myer CIO Peter Mahler is already well into a company-wide technology transformation program that began in 2003.</p><p>He is interested in many of the buzz technologies of the past couple of years, including service-oriented architecture, voice over internet protocol, wireless and applications services, but he wants IT company reps flogging technology to give him the big picture, rather than a list of speeds and feeds.</p><p>''I want to know what is over the horizon. Don't talk to me about bits and bytes. If I'm going to invest millions with your company you need to talk about the future,'' he says.</p><p>Every tech manager will be hoping to avoid the very public embarrassment that landed on Customs last year when a piece of its big cargo management re-engineering project, already late and over budget, was instrumental in paralysing the country's ports when it was switched on in October.</p><p>This year, Customs CIO Murray Harrison will have his hands full tracking down new tech suppliers, as the agency's last EDS contract is due to expire in 2007.</p><p>Customs will to go to market at the end of April with five three-year tenders, Harrison says. He finds increasing the agency's wireless reach attractive, and is interested in the security potential of biometrics.</p><p>''We have a very mobile workforce, and reducing the wires connected to devices that people use in their daily work is very attractive,'' he says. ''Biometrics is also of interest for projects such as Smartgate, which will take off this year.''</p><p>While the big tech revamps proceed, technology markets that ramped up in 2004 and 2005, such as VoIP telephony, business intelligence and analytics, mobile applications, identity management and authentication, and server virtualisation, will only get stronger in 2006, according to CIOs and analysts.</p><p>Although S2 Intelligence analyst Bruce McCabe expects much of the enterprise IT spending in 2006 to focus on traditional enterprise resource planning, financial operations and customer relationship management systems, he reckons the new VoIP and business analytics markets will run very hard this year. Managers love VoIP because it is such a money saver for companies rejigging handsets, leaving aside the savings on voice calls, McCabe says.</p><p>''I was talking to a CIO at a construction company about its intended VoIP deployment. They have to reallocate all the people involved in a big construction project when it finishes after 12 months, so VoIP is a godsend for saving money,'' he says.</p><p>VoIP technology vendor Cisco hopes the big end of town will begin moving to video over IP calls this year, according to Cisco Australia managing director Ross Fowler, while vanilla VoIP is taken up by the small business and consumer markets.</p><p>Foad Fadaghi, ICT practice research director at Frost and Sullivan Australia, agrees with Fowler's designs on the small business end of the VoIP market.</p><p>Continued -- Page 2</p><p>From Page 1</p><p>''We anticipate the next tier of businesses in the mid-market and lower market will start to heavily adopt internet protocol telephony,'' Fadaghi says. ''We're starting to see saturation now in the top end of town.''</p><p>VoIP is big and getting bigger, but the jury is still out on the business benefits of the 3G mobile services now offered by Vodafone, Hutchison, Telstra and Optus.</p><p>Telecommunications analyst Paul Budde says business isn't interested in 3G applications yet.</p><p>''It's far too costly. They see it as a toy rather than a tool,'' he says, although he concedes mobile phone fleets will be upgraded to the 3G platform for voice and carrier-offered 3G services.</p><p>IDC technology analyst Catherin Bennett sees IT budgets creeping up through 2006 as organisations regenerate their systems for growth after spending previous years on compliance projects.</p><p>''This year is about regeneration, the next generation, while last year IT was focused on compliance,'' says Bennett, who also says mobile applications, workflow, business intelligence and VoIP will occupy the minds of CIOs.</p><p>McCabe also likes business intelligence and analytics. ''BI is extremely hot. It's a high growth, high opportunity area.

On the downlink, we will see the first 21Mbpscapable HSPA+ converged devices.\"</p><p>In the federal Government's $4.7 billion national broadband network tender process, Telstra could still end up a winner although it was booted out of the first round.</p><p>\"Telstra has access to massive legal and operational resources to slow the NBN process so it will be able to deploy sufficient infrastructure to capture most of the metro and major regional connections and simply use the NBN when it suits it best once it is built.\" he says.</p><p>\"The lion's share of services are located in metro and major regional centres, so this will make it difficult for any potential builder to sustain a viable long-term business unless they are absolutely certain that their NBN solution is going to offer superior performance at a lower price.\"Dillon tips virtualisation as a hot area also, with growth mostly driven by the need to reduce costs.</p><p>He expects the noise about cloud computing to continue, but says the technology is still on training wheels in Australia.</p><p>\"We can be forgiven for thinking cloud computing is the ICT industry saviour,\" he says.</p><p>\"There's certainly a huge amount of commentary about it. Given the financial situation and the ICT investment plans of organisations, IDC expects this year will bring a lot of vendor hype and messaging about cloud services.\"</p><p>Users typically take between 12 and 18 months to start rolling these services into production.</p><p>He believes 2009 will be an induction year, rather than a take-off year for cloud computing.</p><p>Another interesting area will be the battle for productivity software dollars, as Google ups the ante against Microsoft.</p><p>Google has been busy building its channel partner base for Google Premier Edition but Dillon does not think Microsoft should be concerned, at least for the immediate future.</p><p>\"Google has been very careful not to compete directly with Microsoft's main enterprise products,\" he says.</p><p>\"The only immediate overlap could be Gmail, which could be used as an enterprise solution. At the moment it's limited to the education sector but it could be expanded to other industries.\"</p><p>But dropping Exchange for another platform would pose big challenges because it is usually tied to other enterprise applications and in some instances unified communications services.</p><p>Vendors focused on hardware other than netbooks will be hit by the financial crisis because hardware refresh rates are extended and chief information officers push organisations to do more with less.</p><p>Fran Foo</p><p>Paul Harapin</p><p>VMware Australia-New Zealand</p><p>managing director</p><p>VENDOR</p><p>LAST year was good for virtualisation vendor VMware and despite the economic uncertainty the company expects this year to be as good.</p><p>In the first half of last year VMware's Australian operation was the fastest growing part of the fastest growing software company in history, Paul Harapin says.</p><p>\"Last year marked our arrival as virtualisation became a mainstream and transformat ional technology,\" Harapin says.</p><p>\"We said last year was going to be the year of virtualisation and our prediction came absolutely true.</p><p>\"I think 2009 will be about doing more with less.</p><p>\"Cash flow will be king as companies at board and executive level look at their business to find ways to reduce expenses, both capital and operational.\"</p><p>Harapin says the environment will continue to be a big issue through the year but work on environmental projects is likely to slow down if it requires substantial investment.</p><p>Reporting and monitoring will also be more intertwined with green projects, he says.</p><p>\"Corporate goals need to focus on green and comply with government regulations,\" Harapin says.</p><p>\"So regardless whether you want to be green, you have to look at how you're going to report and monitor the carbon emissions you're responsible for.\"</p><p>As the virtualisation leader, VMware is expecting to forge a number of technological breakthroughs in the year ahead, through virtualisation of networks and mobile phones.</p><p>\"Virtualisation will arrive in smartphones,\" he says.</p><p>\"We will deliver virtualisation software that allows users to have multiple profiles backed up on computers with the aid of virtualisation software.\"</p><p>Mitchell Bingemann</p><p>Jackie Korhonen</p><p>Infosys Australia</p><p>Chief executive</p><p>VENDOR</p><p>CAPITAL-INTENSIVE technology projects have almost disappeared as a result of the economic crisis, but the local head of Infosys is confident there will be more of them this year.</p><p>Big tech projects were all the rage while companies had big budgets during the economic boom, and the global financial crisis had not killed them off, Jackie Korhonen says.</p><p>\"We'll still see those big projects,\" Korhonen says.</p><p>\"There will be extra rigour and due diligence to ensure the boards and executive management are comfortable.\"</p><p>The Indian firm has rethought its focus on the financial services and telecoms sectors, and will branch out into resources, energy and local and state government.</p><p>She says that is in response to the spending pressures companies face, particularly in financial services.</p><p>\"Some of our clients' financial positions have changed very quickly, so they're having to look again at business cases and budgets, and reassess what they're going to do in the next year,\" she says.</p><p>She rules out a federal government focus for the time being, even though some of the company's Indian rivals expect the Gershon review to open up opportunities in Canberra.</p><p>Korhonen says Infosys has about 2500 staff locally and has not made any jobs redundant in response to the financial crisis.</p><p>The company will be a net hirer this year, she says, mainly in the newly established systems integration and consult ing practice.</p><p>Above all, this will be the year Infosys looks to distance itself from its traditional Indian rivals and takes on more global competition.</p><p>\"I don't see the Indian suppliers as a homogenous group,\" Korhonen says.</p><p>\"They're multiple vendors that may be based in India but they are as different as IBM is to Accenture or EDS.\"</p><p>Mahesh Sharma</p><p>Tim Ebbeck</p><p>SAP Australia</p><p>Chief executive</p><p>VENDOR</p><p>WHAT began early last year as economic shivers on Wall Street has now developed into full-blown global economic hypothermia, but one man is positively bright as he looks to the year ahead.</p><p>\"We at SAP have decided it's not an economic downturn,\" Tim Ebbeck says.</p><p>It's what we are calling the new reality because I don't think the level of certainty is going to be there for a little while. So all you can do is continue to operate in the environment you're in.</p><p>\"You can think doom and gloom or you can pick up the opportunities, and we are definitely looking for the opportunities.\"</p><p>For Ebbeck and SAP, the opportunities involve getting lean and staying that way.</p><p>He says it is not just about IT.</p><p>\"It's transforming the way businesses operate,\" he says.</p><p>Companies that made good transformational change in the strong economic times are set up to forge ahead but those that rejected change during the good times are going to find themselves struggling, he says.</p><p>\"When companies are growing rapidly they need reliable real-time information and when they are going through a storm they need that same innovation and information,\" he says.</p><p>\"If there's going to be one trend that rules in 2009, it's going to be ... business intelligence and performance management.\"</p><p>And Ebbeck's mantra applies to SAP's business.</p><p>Mitchell Bingemann</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS200902171032358375</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALI2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7V1J-6G30-YBDY-R47C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>1 - All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 17, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

As\u00a0The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for\u00a0Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) completes rollout of its e-card by October 2020, we will see electronic payments in the grocery segment hit critical mass in 2020, helped by two major developments: While most national retail chains integrate electronic benefit transfer (EBT) payments such as SNAP and WIC into their point-of-sale (POS) systems, smaller grocers have had to catch up. Today, merchants eligible to accept EBT have the option to upgrade from legacy POS terminals to\u00a0intuitive, user-friendly\u00a0and more cost-effective mobile alternatives that provide simpler and faster checkout by accepting SNAP and WIC-along with cash, credit, and debit-on one system. Recently, the USDA's Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) group\u00a0announced a\u00a0cooperative agreement\u00a0with the\u00a0National Association of Farmers Market Nutrition Programs (NAFMNP) to provide markets who accept SNAP with\u00a0access to\u00a0Mobile Market+, a\u00a0secure mobile transaction processing application that accepts EBT and all other forms of payment and runs on a cellular/Wi-Fi connection without a local electrical power source. </p><p>Sam Murrant, GlobalData2020: The year of instant paymentsThe payments discourse in the last few years has focused on the big buzzword technologies: AI, blockchain, biometrics, the Internet of Things. However, the most transformative technology for payments in 2020 will not be any of those, but instead instant bank-to-bank payments systems. The ability to send money in real time between bank accounts has obvious applications for remote payments, and many popular online and P2P payment services in the developed world rely on these systems to underpin their fast, cheap domestic transfers. However, the real prize is electronic payments at the POS, long dominated by cards. Instant payment systems can offer much lower processing costs than cards, making them attractive to merchants - and they can also offer functionality (such as P2P payments) and settlement speed that card-based payments can't match, making them attractive to consumers. These factors make instant payments a direct threat to card-based payments infrastructure, albeit only within the markets where instant payment systems are available. Threat to card paymentsVisa and Mastercard are already well aware of these existential threats to the business model on which they have relied for decades, and have made moves to buy companies and invest in technologies to retain relevance as instant payment become more popular and prevalent. Mastercard, for example, took the opportunity to buy instant payments infrastructure specialist VocaLink back in 2016 - the company has since gone on to help build numerous instant payment systems. Instant payments have already proven themselves in the US - one of the last developed markets to adopt the technology - as shown by the popularity of the Zelle P2P payments service. Zelle is built on a private instant payments system maintained by Early Warning Services, a joint venture owned by major American banking brands. It does not cover all US banking brands, but it has already overtaken Venmo in terms of number of transactions. A step forwardThe biggest step forward made in 2019 for instant payments, though, was the development of TIPS, a cross-border instant payment system based on the SCTInst infrastructure. It only allows for transfers between participating banks within the Eurozone, but it represents a step outside of domestic payments markets for these systems. TIPS has already set its sights on disrupting POS payments, and if it can build enough of a user base via P2P, it will be able to make a strong case for merchant acceptance based on its much lower cost per transaction than card-based payments. The difficulty in making these systems a true challenge to the card-based infrastructure that dominates the cross-border payments market, though, is in making them interoperable with one another. Once that starts to happen, the card-based infrastructure will rapidly fade into the background. In the immediate term, these systems will continue to build domestic momentum, leading up to challenging the card schemes at the point of sale. Cristina Astore, North Western Europe Region Sales Director, SIABlockchain was the star in 20192019 was expected to be focused on the advent of PSD2 and Open Banking, however It has not yet shown its full potential in practical terms. Blockchain instead began to attract more and more attention. The deployment of relevant initiatives based on permissioned Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) went beyond the proof of concept. For example, the 'Spunta project', commissioned by the Association of Italian Banks (ABI), greatly improves the resolution of interbanking reconciliation issues, a highly manual and time-consuming process. The initiative will be fully operational across the whole Italian banking community in the second half of 2020, increasing automation and reducing the time to redress reconciliation issues from three days to less than three hours. Another example is a project started by the Municipality of the City of Bari in the south of Italy, to digitise in total security the administrative processes related to sureties and achieve greater efficiency, eliminating manual error and preventing fraud, by using DLT and smart contracts. Both initiatives involving SIA show the enormous potential of Blockchain to provide solutions in the context of communities sharing common business processes based on decentralised applications. Innovation improves mobility Mobility is another area where the introduction of innovation has brought a significant improvement in the user experience. Italy is driving this evolution. Following Milan in 2018, Rome deployed contactless ticketing over the underground and local railway network. Travellers are able to use their normal contactless credit or debit card at the turnstile, removing the need to buy paper tickets. The system also automatically charges the best fare based on the number of journeys made. A similar move happened at the Venice public transport authority with the adoption of Android SmartPOS terminals on every vaporetto boat in order to digitise the purchase of tickets by residents and tourists alike. Payment digitisation generates a significant volume of data that can be exploited to improve existing services and develop new ones answering customers' needs. For example, transportation authorities can get crucial information about travel itinerary patterns from contactless ticketing, unobtainable with paper tickets, to better serve travellers by adapting transit lines to customers' usage. We expect to see in 2020 a strong development of Big Data systems based on payment in other sectors and not only in transport. The Internet-of-ThingsThe Internet-of-Things will also contribute to streamlining some automatic payment processes. We foresee a rise in the number of such devices, driven by advances in technology and the expansion of 5G mobile networks. Furthermore, we are working to better integrate them within payments infrastructure, in association with Artificial Intelligence to develop increasingly sophisticated use-cases. We will see a further acceleration towards consolidation in payment and financial services. One example is the roadmap to the Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway promoted by the European Central Bank, and another is reflected by our progress in the Business Process Outsourcing of large card portfolios. Finally, we expect to see a strong growth of e-commerce, supported by the roll-out of new solutions for mobile payments based on Open Banking access-to-account solutions introduced by PSD2. Doug Gross, CEO at\u00a0NGDATAA 2020 'perfect vision' for the financial services sector: what will your bank do for you?It's been an exciting year in the banking sector. Along with innovation being pushed along by the industry, there has also been the added pressure of regulatory change, such as the introduction of 2FA this September. In the past few years, much has been made of the potential for technologies such as blockchain, IoT and cryptocurrencies to revolutionise the industry. However, adoption and progress seem to have been slower than analyst estimates - with\u00a0Accenture announcing\u00a0we were close to AI critical mass back in September 2018. But could the moment finally be upon us? It seems like an ideal time to look to the future and imagine what the retail bank of the future may look like. Here are my predictions for the trends we'll see emerging or continuing in 2020: Premium features - innovation must equal experienceAs a range of industries increasingly move towards the 'freemium' model, banking is no exception. 2019 was certainly another year full of exclusive premium features - from metal banking cards released by N26 and Revolut, to a high street bank releasing a fingerprint biometric card. The challenge for the financial services sector in 2020 will be to see beyond their often-gimmicky appearance and branding, to truly understand underlying customer desires. What do consumers need and how can the bank fulfill that need? This could lead to an exciting new suite of services for customers, where the bank acts as a facilitator for a range of activities outside of hardcore banking. Think of the way you currently buy tickets for public transport or find offers for specific events - banks could make these interactions less painful and more enjoyable for customers. The key will be to move from a superficial to a deeper understanding of customers in order to build the services which will hit the right note with audiences. Conversational fluency: time for bank brands to get chatty?While marketing teams have been preoccupied with becoming omnichannel for several years now, the truth is that the consumer world is already miles ahead - becoming 'channel neutral'. But there is nothing more jarring for the consumer than disjointed communications across channels, which belie banks' compartmentalised approach to dealing with customers. In 2020, banks will bring down walls between the siloes of data generated by different channels and platforms. This will allow them to make the customer interactions seamless across branch, online, mobile and more. Going forward, the power to choose the channel of communication will be that of the consumer, not the bank - and they will be able to expect the same level of customer service whichever channel they choose. The financial ecosystem: banks become data vaultsAs customers, we're becoming increasingly aware of the need to protect our data. Banks are the perfect candidates to become our 'data vaults' - becoming the central guardian of our personal data and acting as a platform to manage it and handle data transactions. Data has been called the new currency, but in the new future we can expect banks to position themselves as a trusted advisor over data as they did traditional cash and credit. This will mean a significant rethink of their business models in order to capitalise on these opportunities. So far, open banking legislation has led to the emergence of\u00a0apps like Cake,\u00a0which run on this premise. But with the rising adoption of technologies like machine learning and AI, in the near future, banks and other financial services providers will collaborate more on building new, relevant services and democratising the availability of on-demand expert financial advice and communications. This will be part of a wider trend in which your bank will now be able to offer you goal-oriented help, rather than just new products. Profit v purposeWhat marketers need to learn in 2020 is that there is indeed a business case for brand purpose in the financial services industry. Building brand loyalty in 2020 will have a foundation of authenticity and deep understanding of customers, where the customers and brands are telling stories together. Research from Kantar Consulting\u00a0has shown that consumers expect companies to exercise their influence over the world responsibly - and that when it becomes the foundation of everything a company does, that company will be more financially successful. Yes, banks offer practical services that are necessities of modern living, but likewise they need to have authentic motives in order to gain the trust of audiences who are now looking for brands across verticals to align with their own priorities and social interests. The message to banks is clear: evolve or die. With an ever-growing number of competitors emerging from a variety of industries, from fintech to big tech, in 2020 the financial services sector will be challenged to truly show its worth to the customer by letting go of their traditional inflexible approach and focusing instead on growing their position as a trusted advisor to customers - irrespective of platform, channel, or industry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-D56C595904C640CA88A13DC778DF6DD3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-5551-DYG0-70VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2214\"/><timeReceived>11:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
