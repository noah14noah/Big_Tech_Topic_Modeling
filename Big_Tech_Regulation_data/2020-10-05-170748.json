I'm Rosemary Church.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CYRIL VANIER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): And I'm Cyril Vanier and we're following breaking news this hour, the death of actress Debbie Reynolds at the age of 84. This is just one day after her daughter, Carrie Fisher, died from a cardiac event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHURCH: Reynolds was a huge star in the '50s and '60s but never stopped entertaining. CNN correspondent Leyla Santiago has more on her death.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary and Cyril, we still don't know exactly what led to Debbie Reynolds' death but let's walk you through what happened.</p><p>Wednesday afternoon we understand she was complaining of some breathing issues. That's when L.A. Fire Department responded to the family's Beverly Hills home. At that time we were told she was in fair to serious condition.</p><p>When we checked in with her son, he told us, simply, \"Pray for her.\" But a few hours later things changed. We checked in with her son again and here's the statement from him.</p><p>He told us, \"She spoke to me this morning and said she missed Carrie. She's with Carrie now.\"</p><p>Of course all of this comes just a day after we reported Carrie Fisher's death. She was on her way to L.A. from London when she went into cardiac arrest and she died Tuesday morning which, of course, has really seen an outpouring of support from fans now and family.</p><p>Debbie Reynolds' stepdaughter tweeting out, \"Some of the magic people have left the tribe. For the moment, I am inconsolable.\"</p><p>We have also seen other Hollywood celebrities tweeting and reaching out to the family and on the star, Debbie Reynolds' star, we are already starting to see flowers and candles of what I'm sure will be a growing memorial for the legend -- Rosemary, Cyril.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VANIER: Joining us now for more on that is Michael Musto, a New York columnist.</p><p>Michael, a lot of major artists passed away in 2016; in fact, it's quite striking -- David Bowie, George Michael, Leonard Cohen -- and those are all musicians. That's not the case of Debbie Reynolds; she was really a multifaceted artist, known mostly as a TV and cinema person.</p><p>What trace do you think will she leave in history?</p><p>MICHAEL MUSTO, OUT.COM: Much like her daughter, Carrie Fisher, who died the day before Debbie died, she was a movie legend. Just like you mentioned, David Bowie, Prince, George Michael, their deaths were blows to the music world.</p><p>Debbie and Carrie's loss was a loss to the movie world. Debbie was the star of \"Singing in the Rain,\" which is arguably the best movie musical ever made. She was Oscar-nominated for \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,\" in which she played the woman who survived the Titanic.</p><p>She also did Broadway. She did cabaret. She had a casino. She did everything. Debbie was a singing, dancing, tap dancing demon, who loved to entertain and did so in all media.</p><p>She also was on TV. She was on \"Golden Girls\" for an episode. She played Debra Messing's mother, I believe, in \"Will and Grace,\" and was somebody who was just a familiar face that you could always rely on for entertainment value.</p><p>VANIER: Correct me if I'm wrong but I get the sense that there are not many contemporary artists who are as multiskilled, as multifaceted as she was. You referenced the fact that she was an actress but she was also a singer. She had records that came, she was on TV, she was a businesswoman.</p><p>Seems to me that's pretty rare these days.</p><p>MUSTO: Everybody wants to be a Debbie Reynolds because all the music stars are always trying to do TV and movies so they could branch out. Everybody in movies is trying to direct so they could branch out. None of them can approach Debbie Reynolds with her versatility. She truly had range.</p><p>She mastered every single medium there was and she managed to be personable and deliver to her audiences who came to rely on her as a really likable person.</p><p>But while she was always pitched as an ingenue, as kind of a sweet girl next door, there was a lot more to Debbie than that. She was a complicated person, just like Carrie. Carrie wasn't Princess Leia any more than Debbie was really the girl from \"Singing in the Rain.\"</p><p>VANIER: Tell us more about her personality.</p><p>MUSTO: She was funny. She was the ultimate professional. She never missed an engagement and tried never to miss a performance and always delivered. And she eventually got frail. She was 84 and she had to step down from show biz.</p><p>But whenever she was offered a special award or something, she would show up and she would just glow with the attention because she lived for the spotlight.</p><p>VANIER: One of the things that strikes me, I was just reading up about her career and I didn't know how she had started before she got her big break is when she was 16 years old. She was spotted at a beauty pageant in California and she was really somebody who wanted the light, who wanted to be a Hollywood star.</p><p>And from that moment on, it's sort of this stereotypical story of people who want to make it in Hollywood. And it started when she was 16 at a beauty pageant, lasted until she was 84.</p><p>MUSTO: She did. She wanted the stardom and she got it. She went after that brass ring and it's not just the drive and determination; it's the fact that she had talent. She was able to sing and dance and --</p><p>[01:05:00]</p><p>MUSTO: -- do comedy and drama. She was able to do it all.</p><p>And it became a little competitive when Carrie Fisher, her daughter, started becoming famous and got parts in \"Shampoo\" and then, of course, played Princess Leia in \"Star Wars.\"</p><p>Things were a little touch-and-go between Debbie and Carrie but through the years, they ironed out their kinks and their problems and they became so close they were truly a unit and it was inspiring to see the rapport that those two developed. And I'm sure it was heartbreak that killed Debbie Reynolds because, when Carrie died, Debbie just was hopeless and helpless.</p><p>VANIER: Well, that's what her son said to CNN, that the morning before she passed away, she said that she missed Carrie.</p><p>MUSTO: She missed her terribly. She never thought she'd have to live a life without Carrie. And no parent thinks they are going to outlive their child, who's going to die before them and that was a tragic turn of events.</p><p>And when it happened, I even said that I hope they don't even tell Debbie. I wish they could somehow shield her from the reality that her daughter had died because it's going to be so painful for her, even though the entire world was rallying around her and saying, we love you, Debbie. We're here for you. It was still so devastating for her. And I'm sure that had a big factor to play in her physical demise.</p><p>VANIER: All right, New York columnist, Michael Musto, thank you very much for your time and thanks for your insights.</p><p>MUSTO: Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: And Segun Oduolowu is live via Skype from Lake Tahoe. He is an entertainment journalist and pop culture contributor for \"Access Hollywood Live.\"</p><p>And entertainment journalist Holland Reid is here with us in the studio.</p><p>Thank you to both of you.</p><p>We want to start with Debbie Reynolds in \"Singing in the Rain,\" because that is how people think of her and she is defined by that role. That's really what set her whole career on fire. So let's just have a look at that first.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP, \"SINGING IN THE RAIN\")</p><p>CHURCH: And Segun, I want to go to you first because this, when I saw this movie when I was younger, very much younger, I -- this just was an incredible movie and to know that she was not a dancer before she did this, she actually was shown these steps and she was shut away for, what, three months or so.</p><p>SEGUN ODUOLOWU, \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD LIVE\": Yes, this is -- you know the only modern equivalent would be Whitney Houston, who is not an actress, doing like \"The Bodyguard\" and blowing it out of the water but Whitney wasn't a teenager at the time. Debbie was.</p><p>And she is dancing alongside arguably one of the best dancers Hollywood has ever seen. She's holding her own, she's singing, she's beautiful, she's gorgeous at this young age and then, as I said, her career starts to keep going and spanning all of these decades.</p><p>So, again, we lost Hollywood royalty. We lost class. We lost grace. And to piggyback what the last gentleman said, it's ironic that a woman who gave us so much laughter, so much charm, so much warmth died of a broken heart with the passing of her daughter.</p><p>CHURCH: Just extraordinary.</p><p>And, Holland Reid, it is unbelievable when you look at that piece to know she is only 19.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOLLAND REID, ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST: -- 19 years old. No professional training, hand-picked by Gene Kelly himself.</p><p>Soft shoe, first of all, is not a dance that you just pick up overnight. Is it something that you have to -- there is an eloquence about it. It's a skill like -- not like regular tap.</p><p>So to watch her going, gosh, she really nailed that. Again, it's baffling that she was not a professional dancer. Not only did you have to find your light but hit your marks, remember your lines to the song and know -- learn dance moves that you have never really done before, beyond impressive.</p><p>CHURCH: Unbelievable.</p><p>VANIER: And the way she expressed it herself was that she said she was actually too dumb to be afraid. Because normally that age, you are afraid.</p><p>REID: Naivete takes you far sometimes in Hollywood.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VANIER: We saw that from the beginning of her career. She was in her late teens. I want to show you now something from the back end of her career, what we now know was the -- toward the end of her career. It was in 2011 and it shows you just how she could take over an interview, just with her sunny personality. This is one moment with Joy Behar, back in 2011.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, TV HOST: You got into show biz by accident?</p><p>DEBBIE REYNOLDS, ENTERTAINER: Yes, I entered a local beauty contest because we were a really poor family. And they gave away a free blouse and a scarf you entered. Not you didn't win and I wanted a free blouse so scarf silk. I was so excited and I won.</p><p>And that started it. There were talent scouts there. They took me to the studio and they changed my name to Debbie and it just happened like that.</p><p>BEHAR: What was your name (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>[01:10:00]</p><p>REYNOLDS: Mary Frances, Mary Frances.</p><p>BEHAR: Mary Frances Reynolds?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Mary Frances Reynolds.</p><p>BEHAR: It sounds like a nun.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Does it?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BEHAR: Mary Frances Reynolds, yes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REYNOLDS: -- because -- you say that because you're Catholic. BEHAR: I am.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REYNOLDS: (Speaking Italian)</p><p>BEHAR: I'm not that Italian.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VANIER: So, Segun, you were getting really emotional when we first spoke to you an hour ago. Not many stars today that will look and sound that way.</p><p>ODUOLOWU: Well, she's on \"The View,\" she's talking to Joy Behar, and she slips into Italian and won't let these performers outshine her but she did it with so much class and so much style and panache. When you cover Hollywood like I do and so many entertainment journalists, you are bogged down by so much, you know, just gotcha journalism or people doing scandal.</p><p>But here is someone who had her husband stolen by Elizabeth Taylor and was so classy that she said, you know, look, I was a Girl Scout and he went for Elizabeth and they became friends later on. That doesn't happen in Hollywood today.</p><p>Now it's scandal and vitriol and who can get caught out doing something crazy. And here is someone who just kept it classy. And even when she was going through turmoil with Carrie, weathered every storm. I miss that. That's why I got into the business for; that's what Hollywood was, bright lights and shiny stars.</p><p>And we lost one. Hollywood is a little bit different tonight.</p><p>CHURCH: And she did keep it classy, didn't she, Holland?</p><p>And I did want to talk about the relationship that she had with Carrie Fisher. You know, there were difficult times as there always are with mother-daughter relationships but really they did reconcile at the end there and they were so very close and just the fact she died just one day after Carrie Fisher died is an indication of that.</p><p>REID: It -- everybody is saying that she died from a broken hard. This was a woman that fought -- take the actress off, take the talent away, she was a mother and she fought for her daughter. She fought for her daughter's mental health.</p><p>She said one of the worst times in her life was finding out the diagnosis of her being bipolar. It broke her -- I can't even imagine having to deal with that. But she was there for her daughter her entire life.</p><p>They had that span of 10 years where they weren't close, they didn't really talk that often. But then you also have the time in their life, they lived across the street from each other. They were accepting awards together.</p><p>So you see a mother that was being nothing short of just being a mother, a mother that loves and that cares that will do anything for her daughter. She was an advocate for mental health awareness before she had her daughter.</p><p>So now moving forward in her life and being that person for Carrie Fisher and dying the day after, she fought to the end. And sometimes I guess a loss like that is just so great as a mother, I can't even imagine the idea of burying my own son. So on this scale, I think everyone -- if you have a child or if you have your own mother can feel what that pain must even remotely closely be like.</p><p>CHURCH: Absolutely, absolutely agree.</p><p>Holland and Segun, thank you, both of you, for joining us for this discussion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHURCH: -- very, very sad day for all.</p><p>Well, John Kerry is dropping the niceties with Israel with less than a month left as U.S. secretary of state. His reason for calling them out -- just ahead.</p><p>VANIER: Plus the U.S. is preparing to punish Russia for hacking during the U.S. presidential election.</p><p>CHURCH: And much more on the passing of Hollywood legend, Debbie Reynolds, just a day after her daughter, Carrie Fisher, died. You are watching CNN.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[01:15:00]</p><p>(SPORTS)</p><p>VANIER: John Kerry is getting blunt with Israel as his time as the U.S. secretary of state nears its end.</p><p>CHURCH: He was scathing in his criticism of Israeli settlements on Wednesday, arguing that they are jeopardizing Middle East peace. CNN's Jim Sciutto has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Friends need to tell each other the hard truths.</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Secretary of State John Kerry delivering a blunt message to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. KERRY: The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history within an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.</p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): Pushing back following Washington's decision not to veto the United Nations' vote condemning Israeli settlements in Jerusalem and the West Bank.</p><p>KERRY: On this point, I want to be very clear. No American administration has done more for Israel's security than <person><nameText>Barack Obama's.</nameText></person></p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): Kerry vehemently defended the U.S. abstention, saying the very prospects of Middle East peace are at stake.</p><p>KERRY: The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two- state solution. That's what we were standing up for. The two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy.</p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): Kerry acknowledged the U.S. consulted on the resolution, but denies Israel's claim in the U.S. was the driving force behind it.</p><p>KERRY: The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward.</p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): Israel's Netanyahu called Kerry's speech disappointing and more.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders.</p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): Prime Minister Netanyahu promised Israel has the evidence to prove that the U.S. orchestrated the vote and would show that evidence to president-elect Trump when he takes office in just a few weeks.</p><p>NETANYAHU: We have it on absolutely incontestable evidence that the United States organized, advanced and brought this resolution to the United Nations Security Council. We'll share that information with the incoming administration.</p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): For his part, President-Elect Trump did not stand on the sidelines, tweeting before Kerry's speech, \"We cannot continue to let Israel --</p><p>[01:20:00]</p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over): -- be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S. but not anymore. Stay strong, Israel, January 20th is fast approaching.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu quickly tweeted back, \"President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel.\" Despite the public tensions, President Obama recently decided to increase U.S. aid to Israel committing $38 billion over 10 years. Part of the largest pledge of military assistance in U.S. history, which Kerry noted was not a new stance.</p><p>KERRY: In the midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we repeatedly increased funding to support Israel. In fact, more than one half of our entire global foreign military financing goes to Israel.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VANIER: The talk radio host, Ethan Bearman (ph), joins me now from Los Angeles.</p><p>Ethan, your point of view on this is interesting. And I want to hear you out. You are concerned about the impending <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>presidency, including his policy vis-a-vis Israel, possibly; I imagine you'll tell us about that.</p><p>But you're also concerned about the current U.S. policy, Washington letting a resolution critical of Israel pass at the U.N. Security Council. Tell us more.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN (PH), TALK RADIO HOST: It's a little conflicting as a Jewish person but as an American citizen first; I look at what is happening in the Middle East and I look at the approach of the current administration as something problematic. I did not appreciate or approve of the way the U.S. handled this.</p><p>I think it was damaging to our relationship with Israel. And I do look forward to President Trump being a better friend to Israel. But overall I have concerns with the Trump presidency and I don't support it overall.</p><p>So we can be supportive of a President Trump or a President-Elect Trump regarding Israel. But I'm going to be critical of him and cast a wary eye his way in everything else that he does as president here in the United States.</p><p>VANIER: All right. So let me take it in steps.</p><p>Why are you so concerned that the U.S. let the U.N. Security Council pass a resolution critical of Israel?</p><p>Previous U.S. administrations have done so in the past and they've done so more often than the <person><nameText>Obama administration.</nameText></person></p><p>BEARMAN (PH): Yes, well, I think in this specific situation, you have to look at the timing of the resolution. You have to look at the wording of the resolution and you have to look at what has been going on the last several years here. I personally think that the two-state solution at this point is dead.</p><p>And I don't see how in the Trump administration --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VANIER: Does that mean you favor a one-state solution?</p><p>BEARMAN (PH): Yes, I think so. I think in my travels to Israel and the people that I have talked to, they are looking forward to a peace and stability. And what I saw, Hamas, it's Judenrein in Gaza. And the Palestinian Authority has shown no interest in having Jews living in its territory.</p><p>So as Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about, are we looking at ethnic cleansing of the Jews if we just say, two-state solution, have this territory, Jews leave but the Arabs have full rights in Israel?</p><p>I mean we have supreme court justices in Israel that are Arab --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VANIER: -- interrupt you respectfully there for a second.</p><p>What would you answer then to the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, outgoing secretary of state, who said today, Israel cannot remain a democracy if it pursues the one-state solution?</p><p>BEARMAN (PH): Yes, I just don't agree with that. I think he's totally wrong. I think the two-state solution has been attempted now for 50 years-plus and nothing has changed. Every time it is talking about Israel must do this or that.</p><p>And on what basis?</p><p>So when Israel in the past, even in the <person><nameText>Obama administration, </nameText></person>did a 10-month freeze of settlements, did the Palestinians come forward?</p><p>Did anything change on the other side?</p><p>Nothing changed. So doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity. I think a whole new approach needs to be taken. I think what the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>did undermines any kind of a new approach moving forward.</p><p>And I'm deeply concerned that there isn't going to be peace found in the next four years.</p><p>VANIER: And what do you say to the argument that if Israel continues settlement building, it just makes a Palestinian state totally unviable?</p><p>BEARMAN (PH): I think that's a fallacious argument because how many Palestinian refugee camps have there been since 1948 in the surrounding countries like Lebanon and Jordan and other places?</p><p>Did the Palestinian refugees get resettled in those countries?</p><p>And if not, why not?</p><p>These are the big questions that are never being asked. Why is the head of Hamas, have $2.6 billion that he is stealing from the people, the actual Palestinian people, are who I'm concerned about and who aren't being talked about here and the leadership is subjugating their own people and using them as pawns in these conversations.</p><p>VANIER: Ethan Bearman (ph), thank you very much for giving us your opinion. Ethan Bearman (ph) there, talk radio host, joining us from Los Angeles.</p><p>[01:25:00]</p><p>VANIER: Thanks.</p><p>BEARMAN (PH): Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: Now to another story we're following, the U.S. is expected to announce a series of reprisals against Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Officials say the new measures could be announced as early as Thursday, including targeting people close to President Putin.</p><p>VANIER: CNN contributor and former Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty says the U.S. will likely take several different actions against Moscow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think there would basically be three.</p><p>One is going to be sanctions, we expect. And you would expect that that would be one thing.</p><p>Number two would be some type of diplomatic action and number three would be the covert action.</p><p>And the covert action, we might not even know that the United States is taking some action. They can do it without warning. The president has said previously that he would do it in his own time, but those are the three.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Moscow denies any role in the widespread hacking of U.S. political groups during the election.

We'll be remembering Debbie Reynolds -- next on CNN.</p><p>[01:30:00] VANIER: I'm Cyril Vanier.</p><p>CHURCH: I'm Rosemary Church.</p><p>Actress Debbie Reynolds has died at the age of 84, just one day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher. Reynolds was one of the biggest stars in the world during the 1950s and '60s.</p><p>VANIER: Her starring turn in \"Singing in the Rain,\" one of Hollywood's most famous musicals, started a long career in the limelight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Reynolds never stopped entertaining. She once told CNN's Larry King her career gave her the fun of life.</p><p>CHURCH: She said when her marriages failed, entertainment stood by her.</p><p>Stephanie Elam has more on the life and career of Debbie Reynolds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Singer, dancer, actress -- Debbie Reynolds was a Hollywood triple threat and America's sweetheart. Her film career began at the age of 16 after being spotted in a beauty pageant.</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>ELAM: Her star officially launched a few years later after a spirited performance opposite Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor in 1952's \"Singing in the Rain.\"</p><p>REYNOLDS: They picked me to put me in \"Singing in the Rain\" and they locked me in a studio and, for three months, I had five teachers, one for tap, ballet, jazz, modern. And I just worked, worked, worked until I'd just fall apart.</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>ELAM: Other notable roles followed, including 1957's \"Tammy and the Bachelor,\" which resulted in her number-one hit song \"Tammy.\" She played opposite Gregory Peck in \"How the West was Won.\" And her performance in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" earned her an Oscar nomination.</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>ELAM: At times, Reynolds' life off-screen overshadowed her success. She had two children with her first husband, Crooner Eddie Fisher, Producer Todd Fisher and actress and author, Carrie Fisher. In 1959, the marriage ended in a highly-publicized divorce when Fisher left Reynolds to marry her close friend, Elizabeth Taylor, a painful betrayal.</p><p>Reynolds was able to joke about the scandal years later.</p><p>REYNOLDS: I was a Girl Scout. I was a simple little girl and that's what I was. He fell madly in love with Elizabeth. Now I understand so many years later. And it's in the past.</p><p>ELAM: Her second and third marriages ended in divorce, each time causing Reynolds financial pain. However, she had quietly been collecting Hollywood memorabilia over the years that would prove to be a wise investment.</p><p>In 2011, Reynolds sold Marilyn Monroe's white subway dress at auction for $4.6 million.</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>ELAM: She also never quit performing.</p><p>Though she stepped away from film much of her career, Reynolds continued to entertain on Broadway stages and in Las Vegas nightclubs.</p><p>REYNOLDS: All I need --</p><p>ELAM: In addition, Reynolds had several TV roles over the years, notably playing Liberace's mother in the 2013 Emmy-winning TV movie, \"Behind the Candelabra.\"</p><p>Her wide array of work was recognized in 2015 when the Screen Actors Guild honored Reynolds with the Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>ELAM: Reynolds says she loved every minute in show business. In her 2013 autobiography, \"Unsinkable.\"</p><p>She credited the love she had for her friends and family for her professional and personal resiliency.</p><p>REYNOLDS: I paid 20,000 bucks for this sucker.</p><p>ELAM: It is that spark and sense of humor, along with her talent, that Reynolds will be remembered for.</p><p>REYNOLDS: I love you. Good night, everybody. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:37:02] CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says the transition between his team and the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>is going very smoothly. VANIER: That is very different from his tone on Twitter on Wednesday when he lashed out again at the current president. Then came a phone call from Hawaii from the commander-in-chief himself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: He called me. We had a very, very good talk about -- generally about things. He was in Hawaii. And it was a very, very nice call. And I actually thought we covered a lot of territory. A lot of good territory.</p><p>VANIER: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Mr. Obama have had a rocky relationship for years. And things could change again before trump's inauguration next month.</p><p>CHURCH: CNN's Sunlen Serfaty reports from Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>night clearly attempting to lower the temperature, after early in the day, he escalated his spat with the president, tweeting today, quote, \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O. statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition. Not.\"</p><p>All this coming after President Obama used his high-profile speech at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday to take a veiled jab at his successor.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Even when the hatred burns hottest, even the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.</p><p>SERFATY: The escalating war of words between the out-going and in- coming president, a sharp departure from the immediate post-election vow to work together.</p><p>OBAMA: We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed.</p><p>SERFATY: With promises from both sides of a peaceful transfer of power.</p><p>TRUMP: I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.</p><p>SERFATY: But their relationship showing strains publicly. Obama quipping he thinks he could have won the election if he could run again.</p><p>OBAMA: I'm confident that if I -- if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could have mobilized a majority of the American people to run behind it. SERFATY: Trump taunting him right back, tweeting, \"President Obama campaigned hard and personally in the important swing states and lost. The voters wanted to make American great again.\"</p><p>And taking another swipe at the president, altering an Obama catchphrase, Trump talking in the third person, giving himself credit on the economy, tweeting, \"The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points, to 113.7, the highest level in more than 15 years, thanks, Donald.\"</p><p>At Mar-a-Lago, today, Trump trying to focus on his own transition, receiving an intelligence briefing, meeting with his national security team and, according to transition officials, resuming meetings with potential members of his administration.</p><p>(on camera): And the White House has reacted to the phone call between President-elect Trump and President Obama, confirming it was President Obama who called Trump from Hawaii to have a discussion. The White House says it was a positive call, one focused on continuing a smooth and effective transition going forward. And the White House says both sides recommitted to making sure they stay in communication in the next weeks ahead.</p><p>Sunlen Serfaty, CNN, Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:40:35] VANIER: All right, we're going to have a discuss of our own with the vice chair of the California Democratic Party, Eric Bauman; and Republican strategist, Luis Alvarado.</p><p>Many substantive issues thrown up daily in this profession, the economy and foreign relations.</p><p>Let's start with the economy, gentlemen. And listen to what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had to say when it was announced that Sprint would bring 5,000 jobs back to the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have some very good news, because of what is happening and the spirit and the hope. I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States. They are taking them from other countries and they're bringing them back to the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Luis Alvarado, Republican strategist, seriously, do you think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>can take credit for thousands of jobs being created in the U.S. before he is even in office?</p><p>LUIS ALVARADO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Let's be specific, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>claim was he received a phone call from Sprint, not that he initiated the phone call. And there is something to say about Wall Street, is all about giving the sense of prosperity versus giving the sense of negativity. And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>does have an effect. Up to this point, no one can argue that the effect that was expected to be one of calamity has turned into an effect of prosperity. And that sense of prosperity sticks with <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>And the reality is that the Democrat Party only has one spokesperson that still has the credibility throughout the Democratic Party and that is <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>And the question is the void that is going to exist for the entire party --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VANIER: That is a powerful spokesperson one might argue. He's president.</p><p>ALVARADO: But soon will be silenced. And the question is, how will he continue to represent the issue or the ideology of the Democratic Party? Will he have a platform or will someone else step up to the plate. Because the Republicans have their spokesperson, regardless if you like him or not. He has a very loud voice being heard throughout the world.</p><p>VANIER: Eric Bauman?</p><p>ERIC BAUMAN, VICE CHAIR, CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY: I'm not sure I understand that last point. <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>will be the immediate past president and will continue to speak out on issues across the board, just as Bill Clinton has done. And Bill Clinton left office with a very high approval rating and the best economy we had seen in years. And <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>is leaving office with a markedly approved economy and 60 percent approval rating.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>cannot take credit for any of this. This is the net result of years of digging out of the economic hole we were in in 2008, rebuilding slowly. And the problem is that there are places across America where the recovery just never touched and never got there. And I don't think the 5,000 purported jobs that they're bringing back is the solution to the problem. I think we have a lot of work to go, because here's the bottom line, there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who don't have skills for high-tech and academic-based and professional careers, and there's not enough work for them in America. And we've got to figure that problem out.</p><p>CHURCH: Gentlemen, I want to shift to foreign policy, if we can, because very much front and center right now, particularly the relationship between the United States and Russia and the relationship between the United States and Israel. Observers very concerned about where it stands right now and where it will go once <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>takes office on January 20th.</p><p>Starting with you, Eric, it's going to be quite a shift, very different. We're seeing the olive branch very much being offered from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to Russia, and that has many people very nervous. BAUMAN: Well, amazingly, it has not just Democrats nervous, but it has Republicans in leadership very, very nervous because people have not forgotten the Cold War. People understand that Putin is not a guy to have as a friend. He's not an honest broker. He is a very dangerous man and that is the reason why Trump's approach and his secretary of state designate are so dangerous for our nation because they are playing right into Putin's hands and making Putin look stronger on the world stage.</p><p>CHURCH: Luis, your reaction there?</p><p>[13:45:09] ALVARADO: So far, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has been -- for over a year, said that he will not be capable of doing X, Y, and Z, and the reality is we have to give him the opportunity to demonstrate to those that supported him and voted for him that he will be effective and that his plan will work. And when he has that loud voice and that little bit of a sense of not understanding what -- how the effect will be measured, I think that gives him an advantage to actually think out of the box, act out of the box, and do it on behalf of the American people. And we are all hoping, Democrats and Republican, that he is successful. And I think that is one thing we can get behind the president.</p><p>VANIER: We will be watching very close.</p><p>Luis Alvarado, Eric Bauman, many thanks to you.</p><p>BAUMAN: Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: Unfortunately, we'll have to end it there. Appreciate it.</p><p>VANIER: We're going to take a short break on CNN. When we come back, could Amazon's Echo device help solve a murder case.</p><p>CHURCH: One prosecutor thinks it can. But find out why Amazon is not ready to turn over all the data.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>[01:50:02] CHURCH: A popular piece of technology is at the center of a murder investigation in the United States. A prosecutor in Arkansas wants access to recordings from an Amazon Echo device that was in a House where a man was killed.</p><p>VANIER: But Amazon is pushing back, refusing to turn over some of the data connected to the murder suspect's account. And the case is renewing the debate about technology and privacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY CEVALLOS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: People are concerned because it's something that actively listens 24 hours a day. But there are a lot of things -- technology and data has been convicting people for a long time. The information in your computer can be subject to a search warrant and all kinds of crime exist on computers or your phone or anything else. The thing that makes this a new sort of era is that no one turns on the Echo, it is always listening. And when you activate it, it sends that information to be translated out in the Cloud, the data, it returns back to your home and then it acts on those commands. And that's what has people concerned.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Now the defendant's attorney is applauding Amazon. She says there is nothing useful on that device.</p><p>So, Attorney Areva Martin joins us from Los Angeles with her take on the case.</p><p>I want to start with, for a lot of us with this in our homes, it's disconcerting to know and learn it is listening all of the time. It is like a recording ongoing in our homes. That's disconcerting. But how is this any different to when there's an investigation and they want data from a phone to help find out what happened in this case?</p><p>AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY: The district attorney says it is no different than having a legal search warrant for your phone or computer records. And Amazon's position is not supported by the law or the legal precedent. And now the district attorney has to make a decision. The warrant has been issued. Amazon has been willing to release account information, but not the recordings on the Echo. So, the district attorney in this case will have to decide if it's going the go into court and challenge Amazon and ask a court to intervene and force Amazon to release the data.</p><p>CHURCH: And how likely is it that that would happen? Because obviously, from a pure business point of view, Amazon has to take a stand and say, no, we won't be handing this over but if this does proceed, legally, they would be forced to, right?</p><p>MARTIN: We saw this happen in the San Bernardino case in the terrorist case of 2015 when the iPhone was involved and law enforcement wanted to force Apple to unlock the iPhone, and they resisted. A third party got involved and unlocked the data in that case. These cases provide a challenge for big tech companies like Amazon and Apple. They want to protect their clients and want their clients to feel a sense of privacy with the data on the Cloud, and that comes up against law enforcement who says we may need the information to solve a crime like in this case in Arkansas. And the courts will have to decide, is it an individual's right to privacy versus the government's right to have access to what could be vital information for a crime such as murder.</p><p>CHURCH: Given your background, of course, where do you think this is going? How do you think this will end up? MARTIN: Ultimately, I think the courts will intervene in a case like this, and Amazon and tech companies will be forced to turn over this information. This information is really no different than that information that is stored on a computer, telephone records, other information, which the government, upon the showing of probable cause, has the right to access. Whether it's your home, car, computer or, in this case, your electronic personal assistant, I think, ultimately, the government is going to have access to that information.</p><p>CHURCH: Of course, what we're seeing play out here is that technology is moving way past what we have there in the law. So, something has to be done. Are there moves afoot to do something to create laws and restrictions and regulations so that it is easier for courts to sort through this?</p><p>MARTIN: Rosemary, what you said is 100 percent accurate. The technology is moving so quickly the law is having a hard time keeping pace with it. But ultimately, I think these decisions will be pretty easy. Information like this that's stored on electronic personal assistants will be subject to the same subpoena disclosure requirements as computer information, telephone information and similar information. For us, as consumers, we have to decide, when we bring a device like this in our home, we should be aware that information is being stored on the Cloud. And it's not just a subpoena from law enforcement, but also potential hacking that can happen with this information. So, our convenience has to be weighed against our desire to keep information private.</p><p>And I happen to be one of those lucky people who received one of these devices for a Christmas gift. And millions of people across the country and world will have to decide what do we want to say to our personal assistant and in saying it what are we subjecting ourselves to in doing so?</p><p>[01:55:37] CHURCH: A very good point. I have one as well, and this has been an education to me and, I'm sure, many other people across the world who have access to these. We have to work out what we're doing.</p><p>MARTIN: Right.</p><p>All right, a pleasure to talk to you, Areva Martin. Thank you so much joining us from Los Angeles --</p><p>MARTIN: Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: -- where it is nearly 11:00 at night. Appreciate it.</p><p>VANIER: We're going the take a short break on CNN NEWSROOM. But first, we want to update you on the breaking news, the death of Actress Debbie Reynolds. The 84-year-old was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital on Wednesday when it turned out she was having trouble breathing.</p><p>CHURCH: A day earlier, Reynolds lost her daughter, Carrie Fisher. The \"Star Wars\" actress died after suffering a cardiac event. Reynolds' son told us, \"She spoke to me this morning and said she missed Carrie. She's with Carrie now.\"</p><p>You are watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Atlanta. I'm Rosemary Church.</p><p>VANIER: And I'm Cyril Vanier.

Is this one different?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the New York Times reported on November 14 that the company had hired Definers Public Affairs, an opposition research firm headed by a former Republican operative, to engage in skullduggery against its critics, and that it had refused to acknowledge or stop the spread of fake news during the last presidential election, Facebook found itself once again facing global criticism for its business practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was especially shocking to some observers to learn that Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg was heavily involved in all of these questionable goings-on. Wasn't Sandberg, maven of corporate lean-in strategy and feminist hero, supposed to be the adult in the room at Facebook? She was only it turns out she's the kind of adult who, like the mom of Affluenza Teen who helped her son flee to Mexico after he killed four people while driving drunk, does everything she can to help her wayward kid avoid punishment.</p><p>If the latest Facebook scandals have revealed anything with certainty, it's that behind the sunny rhetoric of making the world more open and connected, Facebook is as ruthless as any other major corporation hellbent on maintaining its market dominance and that its leader, Mark Zuckerberg, has transformed seamlessly from hipster millennial founder to skilled political operative. In fact, his response to this most recent crisis proved his inside-the-Beltway bona fides: He refused to take responsibility, passed the blame to underlings, and issued a press release (strategically dropped into the news void on the day before Thanksgiving) announcing that the token head on a pike would be that of Elliot Schrage, the communications and policy chief who had already announced his intention to leave Facebook ( Schrage is effectively jumping on the grenade here, TechCrunch noted). Zuckerberg and Sandberg remain in charge, and Facebook emerges, yet again, free from meaningful consequences for its actions.</p><p>For the growing number of people concerned about Facebook's power, however, there are some potential silver linings to be found. Facebook's recent problems have elicited responses that blur the usually clear boundary lines that define left and right in our politically polarized age. Facebook has deftly exploited tribal politics for years by behaving like a free-market conservative in its business practices while talking like a well-intentioned progressive. It was considered a compliment to the company when Barack Obama was dubbed the Facebook president and, more recently, when incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was called the Instagram candidate (Instagram is owned by Facebook). And unlike other PR-challenged large corporations (alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or pharma, for example), Facebook was viewed by many on the left as a wildly successful expression of capitalism that nevertheless embraced progressive values the corporate hooker with a socialist heart of gold.</p><p>But as the Times piece revealed, Facebook wasn't purely the progressive, anti-Trump, pro-immigrant, pro-lefty place so many hopeful progressives (including its own employees) thought it was. Zuckerberg could denounce Trump's Muslim travel ban on his personal Facebook page by talking earnestly about his and his wife's immigrant relatives ( My great grandparents came from Germany, Austria, and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam ) while doing nothing to stop Facebook's being used to encourage ethnic genocide in Myanmar, for example. He could wax philosophical about diversity and liberal values while his hired minions spread anti-Semitic-inflected conspiracy theories about liberal activist George Soros. Hypocrisy: It's not a bug, it's a feature!</p><p>But these revelations offer a rare opportunity for bipartisan cooperation going forward. Instead of turning this into another lazy debate about the left, the right, and the 2016 election, Silicon Valley and Washington should be working to combat the very real threat that information operations can pour gasoline on nearly every culture war that divides the American people, Sen. Ben Sasse told Recode. Senators on the other side of the aisle raised similar criticisms. It's a chilling reminder that big tech can no longer be trusted, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal.</p><p>Even conservatives who support markets free from burdensome government regulation should consider the impact companies like Facebook and Google and Amazon might be having on innovation and competition. If you're a budding entrepreneur in the tech space, you don't invent the next Instagram to make something cool (and independently profitable). You do it with the hope of getting bought by Facebook (which will then turn your creation into yet another engine for advertising). Discussing Facebook on Face the Nation back in April, Republican senator John Kennedy said he wasn't looking to regulate them half to death, but we have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it.</p><p>American lawmakers could take a cue from Parliament, which recently seized a trove of legal documents related to an American lawsuit against Facebook and called on Zuckerberg to testify about the company's privacy policies. In hearings on November 27, British lawmakers questioned Facebook vice president of policy solutions Richard Allan, who failed to assuage their concerns. Labour MP Ian Lucas compared Facebook's practices to the approach of Captain Renault in Casablanca, who ostentatiously shut down gambling activity in the bar only to pocket his own roulette winnings on the way out.</p><p>And what of Zuckerberg, who not long ago embarked on a nationwide listening tour many observers believed was a first step in a planned move to enter national politics? Has he been chastened by events? It's worth revisiting the commencement address he delivered at Harvard in 2017. He talked about the principles he embraced as he built Facebook, from a whim in his Harvard dorm room into the behemoth it is today. It's good to be idealistic, Zuckerberg said. But be prepared to be misunderstood. Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right. He went on to urge Harvard's graduating class to find purpose in their lives and once they'd found it, not to be overly cautious about obstacles that might impinge on their efforts to achieve it. In our society, we often don't do big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing, Zuckerberg said. The reality is anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can't keep us from starting. If Zuckerberg's views have evolved since then, it's in a more bellicose direction. The Wall Street Journal reports that earlier this year, Zuckerberg told his executives that the company was at war.</p><p>As the recent (and likely not the last) scandal at Facebook reveals, having a purpose isn't the same thing as having a system of ethical practices that prevent people from doing the wrong things and making the wrong choices when they have issues. In Silicon Valley, ethics, if present at all, tend to be like a vestigial tail, dropped when a company grows past the embryonic stage. Which is why Zuckerberg's vow that Facebook will develop new transparency tools and never, ever hire shady opposition research firms to do mischief on its behalf again, as well as his claims that the company is very, very sorry for its sins, aren't persuasive.</p><p>The platform that handed a megaphone to purveyors of fake news and genocide while touting its progressive values, and that eagerly churned out fake news of its own (or at least some questionable PR) to undermine its critics, is unlikely to reform. There can be no dark night of the soul for a company that's never had one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYST-1343354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYF-3FK1-JBRW-24F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">154608</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Weekly Standard</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Standard</publicationName><volume>Vol. 24</volume><issueNumber>No. 14</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Nobody knows how badly this industrialization of the deep sea could damage the marine environment. Even proponents concede that it'll disrupt and permanently erase habitats that have been barely explored, much less understood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a bleak scenario and - for now, at least - it's on a fast track. In July, parties to an international organization chartered to oversee such mining moved closer to their goal of approving regulations by the end of 2020. Environmentalists and scientists have taken part in those discussions. But the companies that will use those minerals in their products - electric-car makers such as Tesla Inc., battery makers such as Panasonic Corp., and consumer-technology companies such as Apple Inc. - have remained silent. If the worst impacts from deep-sea mining are to be avoided, they need to speak up.</p><p>The deep ocean, generally defined as waters at depths of 200 meters (656 feet) or more, accounts for 45 percent of the Earth's surface and 95 percent of its habitable space. For centuries, humans believed that much of it was barren of life. But in recent decades exploration technology has advanced quickly, enabling scientists to identify approximately 250,000 species in the dark, cold depths. And that's just a start: Researchers estimate there could be as many as 1.75 million more species yet to be discovered, along with 500 million different types of microorganisms.</p><p>That biodiversity is threatened by an overweening global demand for metals and minerals. Last year, researchers in Germany warned of global cobalt shortages by 2050, spurred by increasing demand for energy storage in renewable-energy installations and electric vehicles. In May, a Tesla official told a gathering of miners, regulators and lawmakers that the company projects a looming shortage of copper, nickel and lithium - all critical to making batteries and other car parts. Terrestrial resources are increasingly unattractive due to environmental, safety and cost concerns.</p><p>The deep ocean would appear to offer an alternative. Current estimates are that just one section of seafloor - the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that stretches from Hawaii to Baja - contains more cobalt, manganese and nickel than all known terrestrial resources, as well as significant deposits of copper and other metals. In June, DeepGreen Metals Inc., a Canadian deep-sea mining startup, secured most of a $150 million package to facilitate feasibility studies in the area. Deep-sea mining, the company claims, will yield \"ethical, clean metals\" with \"no blasting, drilling, deforestation or impact on people.\"</p><p>That's one way to look at it.</p><p>The other is more troubling.</p><p>DeepGreen aims to dig up trillions of metal-rich rocks known as polymetallic nodules. Formed over tens of millions of years, those rocks now support unique lifeforms and habitats on their surfaces. Once they're gone, so are those organisms - probably permanently.</p><p>In 1989, researchers dragged a plough designed to mimic seafloor mining across a section of the CCZ, then returned over subsequent years to measure how quickly the habitats recovered. More than a quarter century later, during a 2015 survey, they found that \"diversity and community composition had not recovered.\" Researchers warned that the loss of nodules could cause changes that will last over \"geologic timescales\" and will impact food chains beyond the deep seafloor.</p><p>Remarkably, that research represents the only long-term study ever done on the impact of deep-sea mining. Indeed, according to the U.S. government, over 80 percent of the seafloor remains \"unmapped, unobserved and unexplored.\" Proposed regulations being drafted by the International Seabed Authority, the global organization chartered by treaty to both protect and commercialize the seafloor, will require environmental impact statements before mining occurs, as well as careful observation during the mining. But, without long-term baseline studies, those impact statements will be more guesswork than science.</p><p>This uncertainty poses serious ethical and reputational problems for the electric-car companies, battery manufacturers and other purveyors of \"green\" technology that hope to benefit from seafloor mining:</p><p>How will Tesla's customers react if the company's battery supply chain is traced to the extinction of a photogenic species such as the adorable albino octopus, which lays its eggs on polymetallic nodules? Is Apple prepared to risk its hard-won green reputation if reports show its phone batteries have led to the collapse of fisheries dependent upon deep-sea life? It's worth recalling that a 2015 video of a straw in a turtle's nose spawned the global movement against disposable plastics that's now upending decisions at some of the world's largest petrochemical companies.</p><p>Last year the European Parliament called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until the impact on marine environments, biodiversity and human activities at sea are better understood. It's a reasonable request that companies should embrace, if only as a means of ensuring that their reputations aren't damaged later.</p><p>Firms could also demand better research, perhaps under the auspices of organizations such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative, a global consortium that helps some of the world's largest companies source metals and minerals using responsible standards.

Calling for a \"global reskilling revolution,\" the forum specifies the need for high-tech and \"specialized interpersonal skills\" by more than 1 billion people in the next 10 years.1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The timeframe is short for good reason. We are now experiencing unprecedented volatility.2 The rapid diffusion of technology has created a situation often described in speculative fiction about threats from robots, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced forms of biotechnology-all now rapidly encroaching on the real world.</p><p>While the advent of AI prompted Stephen Hawking to warn that, in the long term, it might spell the end of humanity, others have focused on a more immediate \"specter of uselessness\"-the \"deskilling\" and other effects of replacement of human workers that the forum hopes to address.3,4 In 1950, Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, anticipated these issues in The Human Use of Human Beings, in which he described a second industrial revolution launched by computers. Now, with digital transformation, we're up to a fourth.5 In The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab reviews the disruptive technologies in diverse fields from engineering to biological sciences that are \"fundamentally changing the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope and complexity, ... the fourth industrial revolution is unlike anything humankind has experienced before.\"6</p><p>Indeed, work is being disrupted. For 60% of occupations, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, \"at least one-third of the constituent activities could be automated, implying substantial workplace transformations and changes for all workers. All this is based on our assessments of current technological capability- an ever-evolving frontier.\"7 Uncertain about dramatic changes in the near future, professions-some that may be eliminated or absorbed by others-are reflecting on their purposes, performance and chances of survival.8</p><p>Quality 4.0 is now the rubric under which quality management's adaptation to Industry 4.0 is assessed. So far, this involves measurable improvement in digital transformation-a central factor having visible effects in every industry from transportation to healthcare and education.9 Given the breadth and depth of impending changes throughout all types of organizations, how are 4.0 quality professionals most likely to add value and enhance careers?</p><p>Adaption required</p><p>A first consideration is defining the skills required. \"Activities in nearly all occupations will change, with more time spent on those activities that require social and emotional skills, teamwork and collaboration, creativity, and higher levels of communication and logical reasoning,\" the McKinsey Global Institute predicts. Additionally, \"New work will involve more application of expertise, interaction, and management.\"10</p><p>The good news is that ASQ's quality body of knowledge (QBOK) and the Baldrige excellence framework recognize orientations and competencies paralleling these, including innovation and cybersecurity.\u21222 These skills, however, will be tested in disrupted organizations that assume new forms as they digitally transform and encounter hyper-competition.</p><p>According to the authors of \"Leading a Bionic Transformation,\" new thinking requires a shift from \"a business model based on managing the supply of your product or service to one based on providing whatever customers demand, using any means possible\" in \"platforms where a single winner dominates the system.\"i3</p><p>The pattern is confirmed by the rise of small competitorslike Harry's Shave Club-becoming billion-dollar companies by challenging established corporations.\" These are new, but they also are classic cases of disruptive innovation described by Clayton Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma in 1997.15 Before Christensen, Rosabeth M. Kanter in 1989 inaugurated the age of nimble organizations in When Giants Learn to Dance: Mastering the Challenges of Strategy, Management and Careers in the 1990sK</p><p>We've had the thinking for more than 20 years and have seen effects in organizations enhancing profits while radically reducing numbers of employees, reconfiguring structures and shifting relationships with employees, suppliers and stakeholders. As these effects accelerate, how should quality managers adapt?</p><p>An answer is to leverage systems thinking, which always is critical in quality management. Schwab advises, \"We must stop thinking in compartmentalized ways when making decisions-particularly as the challenges we face are increasingly interconnected. Only an inclusive approach can engender the understanding required to address the many issues raised by the fourth industrial revolution.\"!7 An essential approach to understanding an organization's systems is through strategic awareness.</p><p>Strategic awareness</p><p>Strategy is a principal function of leadership-the word's origin is Greek for generalship. CEOs are evaluated by successful or unsuccessful strategies, although these are rarely developed by themselves. While many common tools, techniques and rituals have evolved, strategy-making processes differ.</p><p>Consider, for example, the differences between large multidivision companies and small not-for-profits, highly innovative firms and traditional higher education, religious congregations and regulated utilities or governmental bodies. Now, across the board, following Schwab's principle, strategic planning processes ought to be collective and driven by analytics, overcoming the assumptions sometimes built into planning tools and siloed worldviews of participants.</p><p>How can quality managers test their strategic awareness to assess the effects of technology? An immediate issue is whether planning is, in fact, collective or top-down. Another is how strategic decisions are defined. How many encompass the whole firm, require commitment and are not easy to reverse?!8 |s quality included in strategic, as well as operational, decisions? How many include technology? Even if everyone is not yet invited to the table, some simple approaches can help.</p><p>One approach is to formulate a strategy statement?9 How difficult is it to write a 35-word statement encompassing your organization's strategy? If it's too challenging, especially for quality managers, something is wrong. Some questions to consider include:</p><p>+ Does the statement reflect prospects of purposeful engagement of technology?</p><p>+ Do the organization's systems support the strategy? Are human resources and training, for example, a good fit with new technologies?</p><p>+ How is strategy communicated?</p><p>+ Is it linked to quality?</p><p>+ What kind of leadership is required to integrate elements of strategy and inspire collaboration?</p><p>Cross collaboration</p><p>In addition to enhancing our strategic systems perspective, it's necessary to adapt to cross discipline as well as cross-functional thinking. Before newspapers were digitally transformed, for example, they were produced in the physical world. The processes of marketing and sales, accounting, reporting and editing, printing and distribution were carried out in high-pressure environments with immutable deadlines. Cross-functional initiatives encountered complex processes and quite different-sometimes resistant-cultures, but the terrain and tools were familiar. Now, we're challenged to cross disciplines as well as functional silos.</p><p>Schwab writes, \"Aside from speed and breadth, the fourth industrial revolution is unique because of the growing harmonization and integration of so many different disciplines and discoveries.'^ Products and means of production span boundaries in new ways. For example, \"Infusing building materials with living microorganisms has already lent inanimate objects new powers. Self-healing concrete, for example, uses bacteria or fungi to fix its own cracks. Now, researchers have developed a living substance that can transform from a gooey sand mixture into a solid brick-and then help build more copies of itself.\"21</p><p>So, construction is learning from biotechnology. Agriculture and the food industry always have, but this living material is surprising. It lends a dimension to quality management. Is quality prepared for unexpected technical disruptions that require rapid adaptation to new disciplines and their consequences in product quality and risk? In this case, those responsible for quality in the construction industry must learn from biologists as well as engineers to assess the product's fitness for use and potential biohazards. Curiosity, openness and research skills, as well as quality standards, are required.</p><p>Structural shifts</p><p>A critical issue is whether organizational structure evolves with technology. \"My sense,\" Schwab writes, \"is that successful organizations will increasingly shift from hierarchical structures to more networked and collaborative models.\" Quality managers now network in \"holacracies\" that seek to distribute authority and decision making, as well as in traditional bureaucracies.22'23</p><p>In The Fissured Workplace, David Weil uses imagery to describe structure: \"The large corporation of days of yore came with distinctive borders around its perimeter, with most employment located inside firm walls. The large business of today looks more like a small solar system, with a lead firm at its center and smaller workplaces orbiting around it. Some of those orbiting bodies have their own small moons moving about them.\"24</p><p>Is it easy to map corporate structure, including where you're located? Has technology disrupted your place? Jay R. Galbraith defined phenomena shaping strategic organization design to include \"ever-increasing complexity and interdependence as firms add new strategic emphases and then incorporate them into their structure,\" as well as \"enabling technologies resulting from the Third Industrial Revolution\" that will \"shift power and authority from global supply chain functions to the customer segments and countries.\" This can be seen in Alibaba and Amazon.25</p><p>Where quality fits can be a conundrum. A 2017 report by ASQ and the International Academy for Quality (IAQ) found that, \"Quality professionals need to become part of upper management and develop their skills to be seen as leaders.'^6 Where \"upper\" now lies may be more difficult to discern outside of traditional hierarchies, but requirements for leadership in Quality 4.0 necessarily focus, as we've seen, on systems.</p><p>Peter Senge and colleagues find \"three core capabilities that system leaders develop to foster collective leadership. The first is the ability to see the larger system. In any complex setting, people typically focus their attention on the parts of the system most visible from their own vantage point. This usually results in arguments about who has the right perspective on the problem. Helping people see the larger system is essential to building a shared understanding of complex problems.\"27</p><p>Christensen adds the need for common vocabulary during disruptive innovation: \"So, when you see members of a management team standing in the way of what might seem to be an obvious innovation, it's not because they're obstructionists, generally, but rather, they don't share the same language. They don't understand how to frame the problem, and therefore, they're doing what makes sense in the terms they are used to dealing in. You just need to teach them how to think differently about the problem.'^8</p><p>This ought to be the task of quality leaders: to frame problems so others can make sense of innovation. With instrumental skills, tools developed historically from quality's beginnings to total quality management to lean Six Sigma and beyond, 4.0 professionals must create opportunities by becoming interpreters rather than victims of technological change across functions and disciplines.</p><p>There have always been cultural barriers to change, as quality managers know better than most. Unfortunately, innovation has often been presented as the next big competitive advantage, dictated from above with touted initiatives modified or dropped prematurely, ignoring the discipline of plan-do-study-act. Fads come and go. Change is episodic and resisted. The challenge is to confront what Peter Vaill calls \"permanent white water,\" that is, change as a way of life and learning.29</p><p>A change in culture</p><p>Schwab advises that, \"Now, faced with a combination of increased complexity and hyper-specialization, we are at a point where the desire for purposeful engagement is becoming a major issue.\"30 Immersed in change, we need a purpose that is deeper than a slogan with \"digital transformation\" attached. Why an organization exists-its purpose-must be experienced as part of its culture31 While a healthy culture is the responsibility of all its members, quality professionals have important roles in shaping corporate values.</p><p>\"It is our responsibility to ensure that we establish a set of common values to drive policy choices and to enact the changes that will make the fourth industrial revolution an opportunity for all,\" according to Schwab^ Galbraith suggested, \"The human side of the organization is being redesigned ... In many firms, emphasis is placed on developing shared values that guide decisions without communication between interdependent units and managers. Selection, development and promotion processes are focused on creating collaborative managers. A culture of collaboration drives many of the processes to manage interdependence.\"33</p><p>How many in our organizations would describe a culture of collaboration and trust it to ensure interdependence? Quality management is well positioned to contribute to such a culture through collaboration that crosses internal boundaries, enhances social responsibility and mitigates risk. Expertise in understanding and deploying standards is at the heart of this opportunity.</p><p>It would be comforting and convenient to benchmark hightech companies on the assumption that their cultures have been digitally transformed and their values are to be emulated. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Often, they are prone to inflicting burnout on employees and imposing technical solutions on problems that ought to be approached differently?4 In addition, they are as prone to evoking distrust (think Facebook) as any other entity. It is better to employ corporate responsibility standards that mitigate reputational risk and, if engaged collectively, improve culture.</p><p>Auditing to a recognized standard (ISO 26000-Guidance on social responsibility or others) provides evidence (measurable and trended) of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Reporting on CSR has increased and evolved, especially in Europe, where it's been codified. Many organizations began with environmental standards and added other criteria. Some have data trended over more than five or six years; others, have begun recently. Reports are curated and archived at the Corporate Register, offering models of how values are enacted?5</p><p>Likewise, risk management offers 4.0 quality professionals the opportunity to institutionalize a set of values through collaboration. Business leaders are going to jail, and with cybercrime and other forms of terrorism on our minds, risk management has become important from the boardroom to the everyday workplace. With ISO 31000- Risk management-guidelines and the risk elements of the ISO 9000 standards, quality managers have another field in which their organization-wide collaboration is critical for successful implementation.</p><p>Robert Kaplan finds that, \"Organizational silos disperse both information and responsibility for effective risk management. They inhibit discussion of how different risks interact. Good risk discussions must be not only confrontational but also integrative. Businesses can be derailed by a combination of small events that reinforce one another in unanticipated ways.\"36</p><p>Breaking down silos in the age of digital transformation should be the work of quality. Quality 4.0 managers require systems perspectives, cross-disciplinary skills, and interpersonal and technical awareness to lead in embedding ethical and risk standards across organizations. Their experience and orientations give them an advantage few other professionals have in adapting to impending global disruptions.</p><p>Just the Facts</p><p>Like many areas of business adjusting to the impending disruptions of Industry 4.0, quality professionals must find new ways to add value to their organizations and enhance their careers.</p><p>Quality professionals are well positioned to handle the disruption and overcome obstacles, but they must first be mindful of the importance to shift perspectives and priorities.</p><p>Systems perspectives, interpersonal and technical awareness, and cross-disciplinary skills will be essential elements in this evolution of the quality profession.</p><p>Henry J.

Decision makers should think of these trends as waves, which, especially if they occur simultaneously, could feel like a tsunami for those who fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner.The first and most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from a relatively distant concern, on which there is ample time to take remedial action, to an imminent and increasingly urgent threat.The mobilisation of various concerned segments of society, owing partly to unusual climatic disruptions in recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies to act now. BP's recent\u00a0announcement\u00a0that it intends to achieve 'net-zero' carbon emissions by 2050 \u2014 a notable promise by an energy company that operates in several highly challenging settings \u2014 is the latest example of business responding to such calls. It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities, but also to tax and regulate those that cause pollution.Second, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations involving artificial intelligence and big data.Society is increasingly recognising that recent technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data, but also for using this information to monitor and alter behaviours. </p><p>Broadly speaking, data are controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), Big Tech companies (as in the United States), or more by users (as in Europe). But none of these three general operating paradigms seems to provide sufficient comfort and assurance to most people.The third secular force involves disruptions to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation.The initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by US President Donald Trump's administration \u2014 from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism), and from rule-based to more\u00a0ad hoc\u00a0arrangements \u2014 aimed at creating a still-free but fairer trading system. But de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 virus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond.These challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth.The final trend is demographic and concerns more than the ageing of societies in Europe and Asia and this trend's economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials' starkly different expectations \u2014 regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action and the delivery of goods and services \u2014 will persist and deepen.For starters, businesses need to be smarter about 'anywhere, any place, any time' delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfillment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become a lot easier, yet often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterward. And all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions from physical to virtual spaces.Each of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments alike. And while being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers therefore must make timely revisions (including preemptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets.Getting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality and agility also is important. And this is even before one considers unanticipated periodic shocks such as the COVID-19 outbreak.The challenges to sound decision making and leadership in both business and government are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the required adaptation. Decision-makers also must consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.As a quick illustration, consider another aspect of demographic change: Migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows that they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse.The combination of de-globalisation and the misuse of AI and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments and encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.The world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can help anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs and risks in their favour.\u00a0Mohamed A.

Japan's gross domestic product in the three months to December shrank 1.6% from the previous quarter, even before the novel coronavirus outbreak in China hit Japan, according to official data published recently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Mohamed A El-Erian/London</p><p>Firms and governments must increasingly internalise the possibility \u2013 indeed, I would argue, the overwhelming probability \u2013 of an acceleration of four secular developments that influence what business and political leaders do and how they do it. Decision-makers should think of these trends as waves, which, especially if they occur simultaneously, could feel like a tsunami for those who fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner.<br/>The first and most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from a relatively distant concern, on which there is ample time to take remedial action, to an imminent and increasingly urgent threat.<br/>The mobilisation of various concerned segments of society, owing partly to unusual climatic disruptions in recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies to act now. BP's recent announcement that it intends to achieve \"net-zero\" carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 a notable promise by an energy company that operates in several highly challenging settings \u2013 is the latest example of business responding to such calls. It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities, but also to tax and regulate those that cause pollution.<br/>Second, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations involving artificial intelligence and big data.<br/>Society is increasingly recognising that recent technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data, but also for using this information to monitor and alter behaviours. Broadly speaking, data are controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), Big Tech companies (as in the United States), or more by users (as in Europe). But none of these three general operating paradigms seems to provide sufficient comfort and assurance to most people.<br/>The third secular force involves disruptions to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation.<br/>The initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by US President Donald Trump's administration \u2013 from co-operative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism), and from rule-based to more ad hoc arrangements \u2013 aimed at creating a still-free but fairer trading system. But de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 virus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond.<br/>These challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management, and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth.<br/>The final trend is demographic and concerns more than the ageing of societies in Europe and Asia and this trend's economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials' starkly different expectations \u2013 regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action, and the delivery of goods and services \u2013 will persist and deepen.<br/>For starters, businesses need to be smarter about \"anywhere, any place, any time\" delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfilment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become a lot easier, yet often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterwards. And all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions from physical to virtual spaces.<br/>Each of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments alike. And while being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers therefore must make timely revisions (including pre-emptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets.<br/>Getting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality, and agility also is important. And this is even before one considers unanticipated periodic shocks such as the COVID-19 outbreak.<br/>The challenges to sound decision-making and leadership in both business and government are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the required adaptation. Decision-makers also must consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.<br/>As a quick illustration, consider another aspect of demographic change: migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows that they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse.<br/>The combination of de-globalisation and the misuse of AI and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments and encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.<br/>The world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can help anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional, and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs, and risks in their favour. - Project Syndicate<br/><br/>l Mohamed A El-Erian, Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz, was Chairman of US President Barack Obama's Global Development Council.

It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities, but also to tax and regulate those that cause pollution.Second, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations involving artificial intelligence and big data.Society is increasingly recognising that recent technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data, but also for using this information to monitor and alter behaviours. </p><p>Broadly speaking, data are controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), Big Tech companies (as in the United States), or more by users (as in Europe). But none of these three general operating paradigms seems to provide sufficient comfort and assurance to most people.The third secular force involves disruptions to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation.The initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by US President Donald Trump''s administration \u2014 from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism), and from rule-based to more\u00a0ad hoc\u00a0arrangements \u2014 aimed at creating a still-free but fairer trading system. But de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 virus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond.These challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth.The final trend is demographic and concerns more than the ageing of societies in Europe and Asia and this trend''s economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials'' starkly different expectations \u2014 regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action and the delivery of goods and services \u2014 will persist and deepen.For starters, businesses need to be smarter about ''anywhere, any place, any time'' delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfillment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become a lot easier, yet often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterward. And all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions from physical to virtual spaces.Each of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments alike. And while being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers therefore must make timely revisions (including preemptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets.Getting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality and agility also is important. And this is even before one considers unanticipated periodic shocks such as the COVID-19 outbreak.The challenges to sound decision making and leadership in both business and government are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the required adaptation. Decision-makers also must consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.As a quick illustration, consider another aspect of demographic change: Migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows that they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse.The combination of de-globalisation and the misuse of AI and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments and encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.The world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can help anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs and risks in their favour.\u00a0Mohamed A.

The inclusion of the word  digital  in that definition may be the reason the problem evolved to the extent that it almost feels unmanageable in 2020.For a long time that word,  digital , seemed to only encompass the likes of publisher sites, which meant that brand safety was often a tick box that we checked when running programmatic campaigns. Blocked lists, approved lists and keyword checks were created to make sure that a brands programmatic advertising didn t end up on any unwanted sites or that ads were not served next to anything untoward.Fast forward to 2017, Google was found to be serving brand content alongside extremist videos on YouTube and despite their attempts to control and fix the issue, brand content was still found running alongside climate change misinformation videos in 2020. The issue of brand safety has come even more to the forefront in the last few months with the widespread boycott of Facebook with the #StopHateforProfit&lt;!&gt; movement. Brands are holding Facebook accountable for their proliferation of racism, hate speech, fake news and bullying content by pulling their spend, some for the month of July and others indefinitely until the problem is solved.  Many questions arise when looking into this complex topic.Why was it forgotten, for so long, that social media platforms also fall into the umbrella term  digital ?&lt;!&gt;This question raises some key issues about the nature of social platforms. These platforms exist because of user-generated content. How do marketers, or even the big tech companies that invented them, draw a clear line between exercising control over the content created and a person s right to freedom of speech? Can big social impose rules and regulations that remove certain user generated content in an effort to increase brand safety, and in turn, increase their ability to sell media space? And if they do, what human rights, if any, does that infringe upon?The explosion of new social platforms like TikTok make this an even more complex issue. As social media platforms evolve so does consumers  use of them. Instead of aesthetically produced feeds, content curation, putting your best foot forward and social peacocking, consumers use TikTok more as an unfiltered stream of consciousness, expressing any thought, opinion, lifestyle choice and even kink that they may feel like at the time. This proliferates uneducated, racist and anti-Semitic content on a worldwide scale   and consumer s feel it s their right to be able to do so. The question is, when does Tik Tok step in and how do brands navigate these murky waters as they start advertising on this platform?Are efforts being focused on social platforms purely because they are big, consumer facing organisations?&lt;!&gt; The fact is, the issue is so inherently built into the way all digital content, not just social platforms, are set up. Should marketers not be looking for a way to completely change the trajectory of how digital content is bought and consumed instead of going after the apparent  big guys ?There is no easy answer currently to both these first questions. Mars  global head of Media describes brand safety as an on-going game of Whack-a-Mole   there is a need to continually squash down issues whenever or wherever they arise.However, the strategy of Whack-a-Mole should not and cannot be seen as a long-term solution.A recent Warc article summed it up nicely  this problem requires so much more thought than just tweaking technical systems. These problems are philosophical, jurisprudential, and these conversations should all have taken place a long time ago. There needs to be widespread change, enforced not by the companies themselves, but at the level of the law. These issues are no longer, or possibly have never been, digital media issues, they are now societal issues that need larger accountability than the digital media world.This leads into the last two questions.Should brand safety only exist within the digital landscape?&lt;!&gt; It is quite clear to see that we no longer have a  digital world  and an  analogue world    what you do online and what you do offline is now one and the same. This makes it even more complicated for companies trying to keep their brands  safe . If you sponsor a sports team or bring on a brand ambassador or influencer, what control do you have over their expression on social media? And if they decide to align with a specific social movement what implications does this have for you as a brand?  The above is even further amplified by the proliferation of  cancel culture , no matter how much research and vetting a brand might do, no organisation or person is safe from being called out by society and cancelled.So, what measures are brands putting in place to not shy away from these issues but rather have a strong plan for how they can both associate with personalities, entities, media platforms and societal issues and injustice and tackle the inevitable issues that will arise.Lastly, are brands the victims of poor brand safety or should they be held accountable for where they show up?&lt;!&gt; What should brands be doing to be both socially accountable but also brand safe?Because of the way digital media platforms are set up, just by advertising brands have been unknowingly funding non-brand safe content. Generally, brands are demanding a refund of advertising funds if their adverts appear next to non-brand safe content. But with these issues being so widely known and understood in the public domain, can brands continue to put 100% of the responsibility on media owners, should brands not begin to be held accountable for where they choose to book media space? The solution may lie in brands being ruthlessly selective in their support of only media companies, influencers and entities that follow strict brand safety guidelines, even if this might result in short-term loss. The answer to what a brand should be doing is two-fold. The first thing is to be ruthlessly aligned to brand safety measures that are already in place and to remove partners that do not meet those requirements no matter the business consequence.The second, and arguably most important, thing is to have a clearly outlined and authentic brand purpose that is strictly followed by both the company and all its partners. Brand purpose is so closely aligned to brand safety that some marketers are foregoing the latter term for the term brand suitability   not only where is it safe for my brand to show up, but also where is it also where does my brand have the right or authenticity to show up. Having a clear brand purpose makes it that much easier to understand your brand's role in not only, brand safety issues, but societal issues at large. They key to understanding this, is identifying what brand purpose means for your brand. Not all brands need to have a societal purpose, some brands just need to have a purpose   and that purpose might just be the product or service you offer society. Trying to retrofit brands into having a societal purpose when they don t or haven t historically, might just further complicate issues of not only brand safety but also showing up to consumers with a believable and authentic proposition. Brand safety is a complex and ever changing issue and it is now up to brands to hold themselves and their partners accountable for the kind of content that exists in media. Taking on a proactive stance to the issue, rather than a reactive stance, a stance that is 100% authentic and aligned to their broader brand purpose.About the author&lt;!&gt; -Megan Sayle has over five years  experience within Dentsu quickly climbing from intern to senior strategist for Carat South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

Blocked lists, approved lists and keyword checks were created to make sure that a brands programmatic advertising didn't end up on any unwanted sites or that ads were not served next to anything untoward.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, Google was found to be serving brand content alongside extremist videos on YouTube and despite their attempts to control and fix the issue, brand content was still found running alongside climate change misinformation videos in 2020.</p><p>The issue of brand safety has come even more to the forefront in the last few months with the widespread boycott of Facebook with the #StopHateforProfit movement. Brands are holding Facebook accountable for their proliferation of racism, hate speech, fake news and bullying content by pulling their spend, some for the month of July and others indefinitely until the problem is solved.</p><p>Many questions arise when looking into this complex topic.</p><p>Why was it forgotten, for so long, that social media platforms also fall into the umbrella term 'digital'?</p><p>This question raises some key issues about the nature of social platforms. These platforms exist because of user-generated content. How do marketers, or even the big tech companies that invented them, draw a clear line between exercising control over the content created and a person's right to freedom of speech? Can big social impose rules and regulations that remove certain user generated content in an effort to increase brand safety, and in turn, increase their ability to sell media space? And if they do, what human rights, if any, does that infringe upon?</p><p>The explosion of new social platforms like TikTok make this an even more complex issue. As social media platforms evolve so does consumers' use of them. Instead of aesthetically produced feeds, content curation, putting your best foot forward and social peacocking, consumers use TikTok more as an unfiltered stream of consciousness, expressing any thought, opinion, lifestyle choice and even kink that they may feel like at the time. This proliferates uneducated, racist and anti-Semitic content on a worldwide scale - and consumer's feel it's their right to be able to do so.</p><p>The question is, when does Tik Tok step in and how do brands navigate these murky waters as they start advertising on this platform?</p><p>Are efforts being focused on social platforms purely because they are big, consumer facing organisations?</p><p>The fact is, the issue is so inherently built into the way all digital content, not just social platforms, are set up. Should marketers not be looking for a way to completely change the trajectory of how digital content is bought and consumed instead of going after the apparent 'big guys'?</p><p>There is no easy answer currently to both these first questions. Mars' global head of Media describes brand safety as an on-going game of Whack-a-Mole - there is a need to continually squash down issues whenever or wherever they arise.</p><p>However, the strategy of Whack-a-Mole should not and cannot be seen as a long-term solution.</p><p>A recent Warc article summed it up nicely \"this problem requires so much more thought than just tweaking technical systems. These problems are philosophical, jurisprudential, and these conversations should all have taken place a long time ago.\"</p><p>There needs to be widespread change, enforced not by the companies themselves, but at the level of the law. These issues are no longer, or possibly have never been, digital media issues, they are now societal issues that need larger accountability than the digital media world.</p><p>This leads into the last two questions.</p><p>Should brand safety only exist within the digital landscape?</p><p>It is quite clear to see that we no longer have a 'digital world' and an 'analogue world' - what you do online and what you do offline is now one and the same. This makes it even more complicated for companies trying to keep their brands 'safe'. If you sponsor a sports team or bring on a brand ambassador or influencer, what control do you have over their expression on social media? And if they decide to align with a specific social movement what implications does this have for you as a brand? The above is even further amplified by the proliferation of 'cancel culture', no matter how much research and vetting a brand might do, no organisation or person is safe from being called out by society and cancelled.</p><p>So, what measures are brands putting in place to not shy away from these issues but rather have a strong plan for how they can both associate with personalities, entities, media platforms and societal issues and injustice and tackle the inevitable issues that will arise.</p><p>Lastly, are brands the victims of poor brand safety or should they be held accountable for where they show up?</p><p>What should brands be doing to be both socially accountable but also brand safe?</p><p>Because of the way digital media platforms are set up, just by advertising brands have been unknowingly funding non-brand safe content. Generally, brands are demanding a refund of advertising funds if their adverts appear next to non-brand safe content. But with these issues being so widely known and understood in the public domain, can brands continue to put 100% of the responsibility on media owners, should brands not begin to be held accountable for where they choose to book media space? The solution may lie in brands being ruthlessly selective in their support of only media companies, influencers and entities that follow strict brand safety guidelines, even if this might result in short-term loss.</p><p>The answer to what a brand should be doing is two-fold. The first thing is to be ruthlessly aligned to brand safety measures that are already in place and to remove partners that do not meet those requirements no matter the business consequence.</p><p>The second, and arguably most important, thing is to have a clearly outlined and authentic brand purpose that is strictly followed by both the company and all its partners. Brand purpose is so closely aligned to brand safety that some marketers are foregoing the latter term for the term brand suitability - not only where is it safe for my brand to show up, but also where is it also where does my brand have the right or authenticity to show up. Having a clear brand purpose makes it that much easier to understand your brand's role in not only, brand safety issues, but societal issues at large. They key to understanding this, is identifying what brand purpose means for your brand. Not all brands need to have a societal purpose, some brands just need to have a purpose - and that purpose might just be the product or service you offer society. Trying to retrofit brands into having a societal purpose when they don't or haven't historically, might just further complicate issues of not only brand safety but also showing up to consumers with a believable and authentic proposition.</p><p>Brand safety is a complex and ever changing issue and it is now up to brands to hold themselves and their partners accountable for the kind of content that exists in media. Taking on a proactive stance to the issue, rather than a reactive stance, a stance that is 100% authentic and aligned to their broader brand purpose.</p><p>About the author</p><p>Megan Sayle has over five years' experience within Dentsu quickly climbing from intern to senior strategist for Carat South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

The text is ready. It is just a matter of political will.</p><p>Europe needs a data protection compact (see IP/14/70):</p><p>We should all draw lessons from these examples and our recent experiences. Here are mine: eight principles that should govern the way data is processed by the public and the private sector. They form a Data Protection Compact for Europe.</p><p>[The data protection compact] would enable us Europeans to exercise our right of digital self-determination. Not to depend on decisions made elsewhere, but to decide ourselves how we want to protect the personal data of our citizens; while keeping our internal market open and competitive.</p><p>SPEECH:</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Two years ago, on 25 January 2012, a great debate began in Europe. A debate about data protection in a world of total connectivity. About privacy in a world where data flows across borders as easily as the air we breathe. About the future of the digital economy.</p><p>9 months ago, the debate took an unexpected turn. The first stories about PRISM were published. Since then, headlines have been dominated by stories about government surveillance. In my dialogues with citizens across the Union, the sense of shock was palpable. We have learned that the times of mass surveillance are not relegated to the past.</p><p>Data collection by companies and surveillance by governments. These issues are connected, not separate. The surveillance revelations involve companies whose services we all use on a daily basis. Backdoors have been built, encryption has been weakened. Concerns about government surveillance drive consumers away from digital services. From a citizen's perspective, the underlying issue is the same in both cases. Data should not be kept simply because storage is cheap. Data should not be processed simply because algorithms are refined. Safeguards should apply and citizens should have rights.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Trust in the data driven economy, already worryingly low, fell further when the first NSA slides were published. The priority should be to restore it. Today I will speak about how this can be done.</p><p> First, I will outline what concrete steps need to be taken to restore trust in personal data processing by companies and Governments;</p><p> Second, I will tell you where Europe stands in this debate;</p><p> Third, I will take a broader view and argue that we need a data protection compact for Europe.</p><p>I. Rebuilding trust in data processing</p><p>The surveillance scandals have been a wake-up call, and Europe is responding.</p><p>A. Rebuilding trust in EU-U.S. data flows</p><p>The Commission took a firm stance from the first surveillance revelations, saying loud and clear that mass surveillance is unacceptable. We set out the steps that should be taken to rebuild trust in EU-U.S. data flows. Three steps are of particular importance.</p><p>First, we must make Safe Harbour safer. The Commission has made 13 concrete recommendations. 13 ways to improve all aspects of the functioning of Safe Harbour. Let me put it simply: we kicked the tyres and saw that repairs are needed. For Safe Harbour to be fully roadworthy the U.S. will have to service it. This summer, we will see how well those repairs were carried out. Safe Harbour has to be strengthened or it will be suspended.</p><p>Secondly, we have to agree on strong data protection rules in the law enforcement context. We need a robust EU-U.S. data protection agreement in the law enforcement sector (the so-called Umbrella Agreement) which ensures EU citizens keep their rights when their data is processed in the U.S. This is not theory. What if your name is identical to that of a suspect in a transatlantic criminal investigation? Your data accidentally gets collected and included on a U.S. black list. You should be able to have it deleted by the authorities \u2013 if necessary by a judge \u2013 once the mistake is discovered. Europeans (and Americans) have those rights in the EU. They should have them when their data is exchanged with the U.S.</p><p>Thirdly, we must ensure that European concerns are addressed in the reform of U.S. surveillance programmes. President Obama's speech just 10 days ago is a step in the right direction. He recognised that the current data collection programmes go too far. New limits on bulk data collection will be imposed. He also responded to a long-standing request from the European Commission, namely to give European citizens who do not live in the U.S. rights and protection when their data is being processed across the Atlantic. In his Presidential Policy Directive, President Obama gave clear instructions for current safeguards that apply to U.S. citizens \u2013 such as the principle of data minimisation and retention \u2013 to in future be available to \"all persons, regardless of their nationality or wherever they might reside\".</p><p>It is a window of opportunity for restricting the powers of intelligence services and completing the negotiations on the long overdue Umbrella Agreement. We need to turn opportunities into enforceable rights.</p><p>I have spoken to the U.S. Secretary of Justice Eric Holder and to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker, to underline that for us Europeans, it is essential these announcements are followed up by legislative action before the summer.</p><p>Trust in the transatlantic relationship is being rebuilt. European concerns are being taken into account in the U.S. reform. This is the right way forward. We need to keep up the pace and we need to keep talking to each other. This is what partners do: not spying on each other, but talking to each other.</p><p>B. Rebuilding trust in the digital economy</p><p>Restoring trust in the transatlantic relations is not the only area where action is needed. Because trust in the way private enterprises process data is low too. 92% of Europeans are concerned about mobile apps collecting their data without their consent. 89% of people say they want to know when the data on their smartphone is being shared with a third party.</p><p>Why are the figures so poor?</p><p>Because citizens know that companies use their personal data in ways that they cannot control or influence.</p><p>Some say that this is a question of individuals\u2019 knowledge being overtaken by technological change. But what does a citizen do when he or she understands, disagrees even, but cannot act? Let\u2019s take a simple example. What happens when a citizen wants to play a game on a tablet. He or she has to pay for the app, but doesn\u2019t want personal data, for instance location data, to be collected. He or she might also be spied upon. Now I know why the 'Angry Birds' look so angry. Often with applications, the rule is \u2018take it or leave it\u2019. That\u2019s when trust evaporates. That's when people feel forced to part with their privacy.</p><p>I believe that this is a question of individuals\u2019 rights being overridden by technological change. That\u2019s why it is important to put individuals back in control by updating their rights. Explicit consent, the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability and the right to be informed of personal data breaches are important elements. They will help close the growing rift between citizens and the companies with which they share their data, willingly or otherwise.</p><p>And people should see that their rights are enforced in a meaningful way. Take the change to Google's privacy policy decided in March 2012. Several national data protection authorities in the EU found that this does not comply with existing data protection rules. Google has been sanctioned in two countries, France and Spain, and is under investigation in four other countries, including Germany. In Spain, Google was fined the maximum amount of EUR 900,000, while in France, whose data protection authority is one of the most feared in Europe, the fine levied was EUR 150 000, also the highest possible sum. Taking Google's 2012 performance figures, the fine in France represents 0.0003% of its global turnover. For them, this looks more like pocket money than a fine.</p><p>Is it surprising to anyone that two whole years after the case emerged, it is still unclear whether Google will amend its privacy policy or not?</p><p>We need to get serious. And that is why our reform introduces stiff sanctions that can reach as much as 2% of global annual turnover of a company. In the Google case, that would have meant a fine of EUR 731 million (USD 1 billion).</p><p>We need a law that no-one can ignore. Rules that not only bark but bite! Showing citizens that a strong EU data protection framework effectively protects and upholds their rights will help to rebuild trust.</p><p>My message is simple. Let\u2019s believe in granting people meaningful rights. The European Union and its Member States are founded on the rights of citizens. It is by recognising the rights of individuals that European societies are considered amongst the most decent in human history. Let\u2019s act to make sure that our principles apply online as well as offline. Let\u2019s give citizens control over their data.</p><p>This is why the Data Protection Reform proposals are central to our efforts to restore trust in the digital economy. They are the answer to citizens\u2019 fears that nothing can be done, a reassertion of citizens\u2019 rights over their own data.</p><p>II. Current state of data protection in the EU</p><p>A. The state of play of the data protection reform</p><p>The European Parliament understood. On 21 October 2013, the LIBE Committee voted overwhelmingly in favour of the reform. The Parliament realised the issue was bigger than the distinction between left and right. Political groups from the EPP to the S&amp;D via the Liberals and the Greens agreed on a single text. The European Parliament wants a strong Regulation, with strong sanctions to ensure that it is respected.</p><p>A few days later, when our Heads of State and Government were asked the same question, some wanted to be ambitious. President Hollande, Prime Minister Letta, Prime Minister Tusk supported President Barroso. Unfortunately, others blinked. It seems that some chose to pay more attention to the spin of lobbyists than to the concerns of Europe\u2019s citizens. The result: since, the European Council acts by consensus, the digital economy summit was inconclusive. European leaders could only agree to complete the data protection reform in a \"timely\" manner, and at the latest by the end of 2014.</p><p>This is a lowest and slowest common denominator approach! Such an approach is particularly inappropriate in the field of data protection. It is inappropriate as our citizens expect ambition and speedy progress when it comes to the protection of their personal data. And it is also procedurally inappropriate as, in the field of data protection, Europe does not decide by unanimity, but by qualified majority in the Council of Ministers, in co-decision with the European Parliament. It is thus high time to move away from the lowest and slowest common denominator towards high standards, a high level of protection of personal data, and a speedy completion of the work of the co-legislators.</p><p>It is true that some companies and a few governments continue to see data protection as an obstacle rather than as a solution; privacy rights as compliance costs, and not as an asset. Yet data protection goes right to the core of our daily lives. It's about making sure that the people operating your smartphone don\u2019t know more about your life than your family does. It's about your insurance policy not going up every time you type the name of an illness into a search engine. It's about your teenage profile not being looked at forever.</p><p>There has been a lot of hypocrisy in the debate. There were those who called for a high level of data protection in Europe, while simultaneously arguing that the Regulation should be replaced by a Directive. A Directive would mean the status quo. It would mean 28 Member States doing what they want. It would mean data protection on paper but not in practice.</p><p>We have listened to these arguments for two years. Round and round in circles while, every day, the headlines have reminded us of why the reform is important. Waiting patiently \u2013 or maybe not so patiently \u2013 as Big Data has been generated against the will of the people.</p><p>And yet in practice where do we stand? Discussions are mature. The text is ready. It is just a matter of political will.</p><p>B. Member State and EU law</p><p>If the EU wants to be credible in its efforts to rebuild trust, if it wants to act as an example for other continents, it also has to get its own house in order. Let me give you three examples.</p><p>First example: the TEMPORA programme in the UK</p><p>It has been reported that under the TEMPORA programme, GCHQ \u2013 the UK signal intelligence centre \u2013 intercepts and stores data from fibre-optic cables that transmit data across the Atlantic and to Western Europe. If so, the data of UK and other EU citizens is collected, on an enormous scale, every day. Traffic data, recordings of phone calls, the content of email messages, entries on Facebook.</p><p>When the reports about TEMPORA emerged, the European Commission wrote to the UK Government expressing its concerns and asking questions about the nature and the scope of the programme. The response was short: hands off, this is national security.</p><p>Where there is no link to EU law, national security is an area of Member State competence. The hands of the Commission are tied. But let me be clear. If I come across a single email, a single piece of evidence that the TEMPORA programme is not used purely for national security purposes, I will launch infringement proceedings. The mass collection of personal data is unacceptable.</p><p>I see with some satisfaction that the legality of TEMPORA and its compliance with the fundamental right to privacy is currently being analysed by the European Court of Human Rights, following legal challenges from numerous citizens, notably from the UK. I have full confidence in the Court in Strasbourg to listen to these citizens from the UK and their concerns. And to uphold their right to privacy against mass surveillance without limitations.</p><p>Second example: the independence of Germany's Federal Data Protection Authority</p><p>The existence of strong independent supervisory authorities is essential in securing the rights and protection of data subjects. Yet in some Member States, data protection authorities are not sufficiently independent.</p><p>Take the case of Germany\u2019s Federal Data Protection Authority. The federal data protection Commissioner carries out his duties under the supervision of the Minister of the Interior. This is set out by German law. It means that the Minister can take disciplinary measures against the data protection commissioner. In the event of a dispute, the decision of the Minister will prevail. Is effective supervision really possible under these circumstances?</p><p>The new German Government believes in data protection. I trust that it will correct this situation. Just as it has been corrected in the case of the German L\u00e4nder and their data protection authorities.</p><p>Third example: the EU's Data Retention Directive</p><p>I have spoken about the Member States. The EU itself should also look carefully at some of its laws. Neither the Commission, the Council, nor the European Parliament can be proud of the Data Retention Directive.</p><p>The Directive requires telecom companies to store all telephony metadata. This includes geo-location data. The Directive went from proposal to statute book in 6 months. The Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice has recently said out-loud what many of us have been thinking. The data is kept for too long, it is too easily accessed and the risk of abuse is too great. It takes the spirit of the 9/11 aftermath too far. The Advocate-General does not say that data does not need to be retained. He says that greater safeguards need to apply. The Opinion contains a recipe for all those who want the Data Retention Directive to strike the right balance between rights and security.</p><p>One cannot simply use \"national security\" as a trump card and disregard citizens' rights. That is what others used to do. The European Data Retention law needs a health check. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the medicine.</p><p>III. A data protection compact for Europe</p><p>We should all draw lessons from these examples and our recent experiences. Here are mine: eight principles that should govern the way data is processed by the public and the private sector. They form a Data Protection Compact for Europe.</p><p>First of all, we need the data protection reform in the statute book. I wish to see full speed on data protection in 2014. Europe must act decisively to establish a robust data protection framework that can be the gold standard for the world. Otherwise others will move first and impose their standards on us.</p><p>Second, the reform should not distinguish between the private and the public sector. The 1995 directive deals with both. Introducing a distinction today, when citizens are more concerned about processing by the public sector, would not be acceptable. The same principles should apply to both. Citizens would simply not understand a split in times when the public sector collects, collates and sometimes even wants to sell private data. It is also a very difficult distinction to draw when a local authority can buy storage space on a private cloud.</p><p>Third, laws setting out data protection rules or affecting privacy require public debate because they relate to civil liberties online. Take the Polish experience with ACTA and data protection reform. ACTA was not explained. It led to the biggest protests since the fall of Communism and the shock-waves reverberated throughout the European Parliament. The lesson was learnt by the Polish Government. Data protection was the subject of a public information campaign. It led to a joint position paper by the private employers association and the leading civil liberties NGO.</p><p>My fourth principle relates to surveillance. Data collection should be targeted and be limited to what is proportionate to the objectives that have been set. If this element of proportionality is lost, citizens' acceptance will be lost as well. Blanket surveillance of electronic communications data is not acceptable. It amounts to arbitrary interference with the private lives of citizens. We can't treat all citizens like suspects. In the past you couldn't sit in someone's basement and read their letters. Today you shouldn't sit in an office and trawl through their emails.</p><p>Fifth, laws need to be clear and laws need to be kept up to date. I was struck by the reaction of the author of the U.S. Patriot Act, Jim Sensenbrenner to the NSA revelations: \"This is not what the Patriot Act was meant to do!\". Technological change allowed the Patriot Act to be applied in ways that had not been imagined at the time it was written. I draw an important principle from this: It cannot be that States rely on outdated rules, drafted in a different technological age, to frame modern surveillance programmes. Such laws give citizens little or no idea about what is actually going on.</p><p>Sixth, national security should be invoked sparingly. It should be the exception, rather than the rule. The need to protect national security can justify special rules. But not everything that relates to foreign relations is a matter of national security. I believe that it is dangerous to invoke national security where it is not really at stake. It undermines the legitimacy of laws that are vital for our security.</p><p>Seventh, without a role for judicial authorities, there can be no real oversight. Executive oversight is good. Parliamentary oversight is necessary. Judicial oversight is key. Ultimately, whether processing is legitimate is a question of balance between different imperatives, the need to protect privacy and the importance of maintaining security. The judiciary is necessary to ensure that the pendulum does not swing too far.</p><p>And finally a message to our American friends. Data Protection rules should apply irrespective of the nationality of the person concerned. Applying different standards to nationals and non-nationals makes no sense in view of the open nature of the internet. Ultimately, distinguishing between the rights of individuals depending on their nationality and place of residence impedes the free flow of data. Europe should be very proud of the fact that it treats data protection as a fundamental right \u2013 a fundamental right on which every human-being can rely. Companies have understood this \u2013 a big tech giant has just announced it will give its users the option of storing their data in Europe, where it's safe. I hope many other companies will take similar initiatives in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Conclusion: data protection and an open internet</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>The principles I have set out would restore trust in the way in which companies and governments process data. Citizens would benefit because offline rights would apply online. The digital economy would benefit because its growth would be sustainable. National security would benefit because the laws which help secure it would be more legitimate.</p><p>The internet would also benefit. Citizens have been destabilised by what they have learned over the past months. If trust is not restored, they will want their data to remain within borders. It is in the interest of a free internet and of an open internet that we apply these principles and that we empower citizens. That we give our citizens the rights that they deserve.</p><p>Last but not least, Europe would benefit. The recent revelations have shown: at the moment, national governments in Europe are unable to guarantee citizens' personal data is well protected. The Data Protection Compact would change this. It would enable us Europeans to exercise our right of digital self-determination. Not to depend on decisions made elsewhere, but to decide ourselves how we want to protect the personal data of our citizens; while keeping our internal market open and competitive. This is, after all, what Europe is all about. Europe is there to ensure that the rights and interests of our citizens are well protected. And, on that basis, to agree on terms with our partners in the world. Alongside the European Parliament and the majority of governments in Europe, I will continue fighting for this. Because our citizens deserve nothing less.</p><p>For more information please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu\">http://europa.eu</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PON221528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BD1-68R1-DXCW-D3K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 28, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>National</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

En fran\u00e7ais, on dirait: \u00abtenter de limiter les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts\u00bb. Voil\u00e0, peu ou prou, ce \u00e0 quoi se sont \u00e9vertu\u00e9s les Big Tech, ces g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains du Web, tout au long de cette \u00e9dition 2019 du Forum \u00e9conomique mondial, du 22 au 25janvier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">D'interventions publiques en r\u00e9unions \u00abportes closes\u00bb avec des petits groupes d'experts et de m\u00e9dias, l'heure \u00e9tait \u00e0 la contre-offensive de relations publiques pour tenter de d\u00e9miner les attaques dont ils font l'objet. Trop gros, trop puissants, pas assez transparents ni suffisamment tax\u00e9s, ceux que la France surnomme les GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple) font face \u00e0 une liste de dol\u00e9ances qui ne cesse de s'allonger. \u00abMais nous sommes utiles aux consommateurs, d\u00e9fend vigoureusement le responsable de l'une de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Ils font confiance \u00e0 nos services, tous leurs usages le d\u00e9montrent!\u00bb</p><p>Se retrouver sur le banc des accus\u00e9s \u00e0 Davos, dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en d'autres temps les enfants ch\u00e9ris, n'est pas, pour eux, une situation tout \u00e0 fait nouvelle. En2018 d\u00e9j\u00e0, ils avaient d\u00fb affronter l'image n\u00e9gative n\u00e9e du r\u00f4le de Facebook dans les campagnes \u00e9lectorales au Royaume-Uni et aux Etats-Unis. Exacerb\u00e9 par la mont\u00e9e du populisme et des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s, le d\u00e9bat a gagn\u00e9 en intensit\u00e9 cette ann\u00e9e. Il s'est aussi \u00e9largi et d\u00e9plac\u00e9 sur le terrain de la protection des donn\u00e9es, de la r\u00e9gulation et de la taxation.</p><p> \u00abDes r\u00e9actions de rejet \u00bb </p><p>\u00abLes donn\u00e9es sont entre les mains d'un tout petit nombre de plates-formes. Et nous voyons des r\u00e9actions de rejet s'exprimer contre ces entreprises, fait remarquer le pourtant tr\u00e8s temp\u00e9r\u00e9 Klaus Schwab, fondateur du Forum de Davos, lors d'un dialogue avec le patron de Microsoft, Satya Nadella. Comment s'assurer que cette collecte de donn\u00e9es ne sert pas juste les int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux et \u00e9go\u00efstes de quelques groupes?\u00bb</p><p>Le ton est donn\u00e9. Dans les couloirs du Palais des congr\u00e8s, les patrons ont beau faire assaut de techno-optimisme, personne n'est dupe quant aux inqui\u00e9tudes que suscite, aupr\u00e8s du grand public, l'impact du num\u00e9rique sur l'\u00e9conomie et sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Publi\u00e9 au premier jour du forum, le barom\u00e8tre Edelman sur la confiance en t\u00e9moigne: 73% des sond\u00e9s redoutent que les infox (\u00abfake news\u00bb) puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es comme des \u00abarmes\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abOn a vu le r\u00f4le dangereux des r\u00e9seaux sociaux dans la campagne am\u00e9ricaine et aujourd'hui avec les \u201cgilets jaunes\", abonde le dirigeant fran\u00e7ais d'un groupe technologique. Il faut se demander s\u00e9rieusement comment les r\u00e9guler.\u00bb </p><p>Tr\u00e8s mobilis\u00e9 \u00e0 Davos, Facebook a convoqu\u00e9 de grands noms de la politique britannique pour participer \u00e0 sa r\u00e9flexion: outre l'ex-chef du parti lib\u00e9ral Nick Clegg, recrut\u00e9 par le groupe, l'ancien premier ministre Tony Blair et l'ex-ministre des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res David Miliband ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9s. Sheryl Sandberg, la num\u00e9ro deux du r\u00e9seau social, est \u00e0 la manoeuvre, organisant tables rondes et r\u00e9unions diverses pour \u00abcomprendre\u00bb les griefs et vendre les efforts de transparence et de responsabilit\u00e9 accomplis depuis 2016.</p><p> \u00abProbl\u00e8me d'\u00e9quit\u00e9\u00bb </p><p>Certains v\u00e9t\u00e9rans du secteur se r\u00e9signent \u00e0 la solution de la r\u00e9gulation, \u00e0 laquelle ils ont longtemps r\u00e9sist\u00e9 au nom de la libert\u00e9 de l'innovation. Mais, pour eux, c'est aux Etats de formuler des solutions: \u00abOn ne peut pas demander aux entreprises de savoir ce qu'elles doivent faire ou non\u00bb, r\u00e9sume le fondateur d'un grand groupe technologique.</p><p>Un d\u00e9bat similaire flotte autour de la fiscalit\u00e9 tandis que progressent les r\u00e9flexions sur la taxation des g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique. Le ministre de l'\u00e9conomie, Bruno Le Maire, a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 le projet de Paris d'avancer, m\u00eame seul, sur l'imposition d'une \u00abtaxe GAFA\u00bb. \u00abPersonne ne peut comprendre que les plus grosses entreprises du monde paient moins d'imp\u00f4ts que de petites PME\u00bb, a-t-il martel\u00e9.</p><p>Mais dans les milieux d'affaires, on fait remarquer qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un sujet concernant d'abord les gouvernements. Pourquoi renvoyer au secteur priv\u00e9 le soin d'\u00eatre vertueux alors que les Etats, au sein m\u00eame de l'Europe, se livrent une guerre fiscale?</p><p>\u00abLa v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9torque Winnie Byanyima, directrice de l'ONG Oxfam, venue dans les Alpes suisses alerter les \u00e9lites sur la mont\u00e9e des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s, c'est que ces Big Tech exploitent habilement les trous du syst\u00e8me pour ne pas payer d'imp\u00f4t, et s'assurent que rien ne changera gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un intense lobbying. Mais cela pose un grave probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et nourrit la col\u00e8re.\u00bb</p><p>George Soros ne dit pas autre chose. L'an dernier d\u00e9j\u00e0, dans la station des Grisons, il avait sonn\u00e9 la charge contre les g\u00e9ants du Net, en particulier Facebook et Google, accus\u00e9s d'\u00eatre des \u00abobstacles \u00e0 l'innovation\u00bb en raison de leur comportement monopolistique. Cette ann\u00e9e, c'est la Chine, son r\u00e9gime autoritaire et son syst\u00e8me de surveillance organis\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'intelligence artificielle que l'investisseur a pris pour cibles.</p><p>Dans l'\u00e9preuve de force qui oppose P\u00e9kin et Washington, de quel c\u00f4t\u00e9 sont les GAFA, lui a-t-on demand\u00e9? La r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 cinglante: \u00abFacebook, Google et compagnie sont du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de leurs profits. Ils essaient d'ignorer la politique et se sont, tout simplement, vendus pour maximiser leurs b\u00e9n\u00e9fices.\u00bb</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LMONDF-5414942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LMONDF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8S-X791-JD45-J0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">322025</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Monde Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48604\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Samedi 26 Janvier 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Shares of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. built on already-torrid rallies after each reported earnings or revenue that crushed analyst estimates. Combined, the companies put up sales of $200 billion in the three months ended in June, with Amazon reporting a record quarter.   The earnings served as further evidence to frenzied stock investors that the companies' automated, algorithmically optimized businesses are not only weathering the coronavirus pandemic but are thriving in it. Politically, they could reinforce suspicions that growth in U.S. technology providers has gotten unhinged. The firms are booming while Old Economy industries like retailing and car-making falter, pushing scores of companies into insolvency and costing millions of Americans their jobs.   \"I will tell you this, it's good that these tech giants did their hearings yesterday and not tomorrow given all these results,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Bloomberg Television.   Combined, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook boast a market-cap above $5 trillion, about a fifth of the entire S&amp;P 500. While the average S&amp;P 500 stock is still down 7% in 2020, an index of Fang stocks is up 34%.   The chief executives were forced to defend themselves from the sometimes withering criticism of lawmakers who said they were abusing monopoly-like power to expand influence. Amazon's Jeff Bezos was grilled on his company's treatment of small merchants who use Amazon's online marketplace, while Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, faced questions about whether its Google unit exploited its dominant position in advertising.   \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\" said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is leading a yearlong House investigation into the companies. \"Some need to be broken up, all need to be heavily regulated.\"   In written testimony and in their responses, the CEOs told Congress that competition is thriving across the tech industry and consumers are benefiting.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. built on already-torrid rallies after each reported earnings or revenue that crushed analyst estimates. Combined, the companies put up sales of $200 billion in the three months ended in June, with Amazon reporting a record quarter.   The earnings served as further evidence to frenzied stock investors that the companies\u2019 automated, algorithmically optimized businesses are not only weathering the coronavirus pandemic but are thriving in it. Politically, they could reinforce suspicions that growth in U.S. technology providers has gotten unhinged. The firms are booming while Old Economy industries like retailing and car-making falter, pushing scores of companies into insolvency and costing millions of Americans their jobs.   \u201cI will tell you this, it\u2019s good that these tech giants did their hearings yesterday and not tomorrow given all these results,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Bloomberg Television.   Combined, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook boast a market-cap above $5 trillion, about a fifth of the entire S&amp;P 500. While the average S&amp;P 500 stock is still down 7% in 2020, an index of Fang stocks is up 34%.   The chief executives were forced to defend themselves from the sometimes withering criticism of lawmakers who said they were abusing monopoly-like power to expand influence. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos was grilled on his company\u2019s treatment of small merchants who use Amazon\u2019s online marketplace, while Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, faced questions about whether its Google unit exploited its dominant position in advertising.   \u201cThese companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is leading a yearlong House investigation into the companies. \u201cSome need to be broken up, all need to be heavily regulated.\u201d   In written testimony and in their responses, the CEOs told Congress that competition is thriving across the tech industry and consumers are benefiting.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It is a question raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, which has spotlighted systemic racism in the US and the economic inequality that accompanies it. But it is also a question for the corporate world more broadly \u2014 and in particular for Big Tech. </p><p>Social media companies such as Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa723316-67e6-41a3-9f37-e9c6b8855edb\"> losing advertising dollars</url> from large companies worried about being associated with the inflammatory content published on these platforms. However, it will take far more than an ad boycott around hate speech to curb the economic power of Big Tech.</p><p>For starters, the boycott may be just an opportunistic way to do some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffefed51-c82b-4b7a-9671-5bc73edc77a3\"> virtue signalling</url> when marketing budgets are already down. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is betting on that, reportedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/505644-mark-zuckerberg-says-he-expects-advertisers-boycotting\"> telling</url> employees, \u201cmy guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough\u201d. Whether or not he is right, boycotters including Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Unilever make up a small share of overall social media ad revenues. More than 70 per cent of Facebook\u2019s $70bn of advertising revenues comes from small businesses.</p><p>They have been decimated by the pandemic. But when they return, it\u2019s a fair bet they will spend whatever marketing budgets they have left on digital advertising, which is cheaper and more efficient than other kinds. Yes, online advertising has taken a hit. But the viability of the surveillance capitalism business model, so called because it commodifies personal data to make profits, hasn\u2019t changed. </p><p>Indeed, it is quite likely that the largest consumer data collectors \u2014 including Google, Amazon, and Facebook \u2014 will emerge bigger and more powerful after the pandemic. The weighting of the technology sector in the S&amp;P 500, buoyed by a handful of large companies, is near 30 per cent \u2014 a 20-year high.</p><p>So while boycotts draw attention to issues such as toxic content, privacy and civil liberties, an equitable sharing-out of digital wealth requires other things. </p><p>The most important is more transparency. Like big financial institutions, large consumer technology companies traffic in information. They sit in the middle of an hourglass, viewing every transaction that moves through with a clarity unavailable to consumers, competitors or regulators. </p><p>That information asymmetry gives them a problematic advantage. As Adam Smith put it, for markets to be fair and efficient, parties on both sides of a transaction need equal access to information and a shared understanding of what is being exchanged. That is not how surveillance capitalism works today.</p><p>The opacity of online transactions and the power it gives to Big Tech is a key reason why regulators in Europe and the US want to open their algorithmic black boxes. Sherrod Brown, the most senior member of the US Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs (and a fighter for more transparency and tougher financial regulation after the 2008 crisis) has proposed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/privacy-isnt-a-right-you-can-click-away/\"> legislation</url> that would change the dynamics of data collection. </p><p>It aims to shift the burden of responsibility away from consumers, who have to read 4,000-word privacy policies and click \u201cI agree\u201d. As well as banning facial recognition technology, it would also confine data monetisation to single transactions, rather than allowing companies to collect consumer data for a variety of uses and unlimited amounts of time. </p><p>Enforcement of such rules would probably require <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/11/why-we-need-to-audit-algorithms\"> algorithmic auditing</url>. Interest in this has grown due to a Covid-19-related boost in the use of artificial intelligence and automation to manage credit scores, loan applications, hiring decisions and the like. Avoiding \u201calgoracism\u201d may seem to be about social justice. It is also about competition. </p><p>Companies complain that if regulators force them to open their algorithmic black boxes and change their business models, then the ease and utility of their services will fall. Senator Brown\u2019s answer is: \u201cSilicon Valley should respond by doing what it has always done best: innovating.\u201d He makes an analogy to the environmental disasters of the 1960s, which ultimately led to the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency and lower emission vehicles \u2014 a trend that reached an apex recently when Tesla became the world\u2019s most valuable automaker.</p><p>As well as opacity, Big Tech relies on scale and global reach to generate disproportionate profits. But deglobalisation and the world\u2019s fragmenting technological landscape will limit the ability of companies to grow across borders: witness <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08e15c26-48e0-4540-a040-1a8782e84f2e\">India\u2019s banning of Chinese social media firm TikTok</url>. Meanwhile, in the US, the heads of Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon will convene at the end of July in Washington DC for antitrust hearings, the first big debate about US competition policy in half a century.</p><p>The final tailwind to Big Tech\u2019s economic power has been tax policy. None of Democratic presumptive nominee Joe Biden\u2019s proposals would increase taxes on the tech sector specifically, as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41069548-a3d8-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1\"> UK and some European countries</url> have proposed. Yet it is thanks to relatively low tax rates that Big Tech keeps a chunk of its corporate profits. If we want real economic justice, I suspect we will need a digital dividend tax too. Corporate boycotts make a political statement. It will take more than that to have an impact on Silicon Valley\u2019s bottom line.</p><p/><p>\u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-864303bcda27423faebe59ebcbab96cc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6091-0P41-JB77-K08H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In response, Mr. Trump accused Twitter of stifling speech and declared that he would put a stop to the interference.</p><p>  On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to make it easier for federal regulators to argue that companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter were suppressing free speech when they suspended users or deleted posts. The tech companies have had ''unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,'' he said.</p><p>  But Twitter has doubled down. Late Wednesday, it added fact-checking labels to messages from Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry who had claimed that the coronavirus outbreak may have begun in the United States and been brought to China by the U.S. military.</p><p>Twitter also added notices on hundreds of tweets that falsely claimed a photo of a man in a red baseball cap was Derek Chauvin, an officer involved in the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died this week after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police. The Twitter label alerted viewers that the image was ''manipulated media.'' </p><p>  The skirmish between Twitter and Mr. Trump shows that a backlash against large tech companies, which had receded in the initial phases of the pandemic, is now back in full force. The Justice Department has also recently signaled that it is preparing to bring an antitrust case against Google, perhaps as soon as this summer.</p><p>  The executive order ''seems designed to punish a handful of companies for perceived slights,'' said Jon Berroya, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group representing many of the major tech companies. ''It stands to undermine a variety of government efforts to protect public safety and spread critical information online through social media and threatens the vibrancy of a core segment of our economy.''</p><p>  A Twitter spokeswoman said that the tweets modified on Wednesday contained ''potentially misleading content'' and that the fact-checking was consistent with the company's approach this month.</p><p>  In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, also said he would not back down from the fact-checking effort. ''We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information,'' he wrote.</p><p>  The executive order aims at protections granted to technology services under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law gives tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter broad immunity from liability for content created by their users.</p><p>  As Mr. Trump and other conservative figures have claimed that social media companies are biased against them, Republican lawmakers have proposed modifications to the statute. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has argued that to maintain Section 230 protections, social media services should be required to submit to a third-party audit to ensure their content moderation systems are politically neutral.</p><p>  Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who wrote the law, said Mr. Trump was threatening Section 230 to ''chill speech and bully'' the big tech companies into giving the White House more favorable treatment.</p><p>  ''He's clearly targeting Section 230 because it protects private businesses' right not to have to play host to his lies,'' Mr. Wyden said in a statement. ''Efforts to erode Section 230 will only make online content more likely to be false and dangerous.''</p><p>  The executive order is likely to face legal challenges.</p><p>  Harold Feld, the senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a policy nonprofit group, said the order appeared to be intended to limit speech on social media that disagreed with the president. That was ''literally the worst case scenario that the authors of the First Amendment were afraid of,'' he said.</p><p>Twitter's confrontation with Mr. Trump has also opened new fissures in Silicon Valley. Mr. Dorsey has doubled down on fact-checking tweets, but Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has distanced his social network from that effort.</p><p>  ''I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said in a taped television interview that ran Thursday morning on Fox News.</p><p>  His comments were at odds with some of his own company's actions. In the past, Facebook, too, introduced fact-checking labels, using third-party services to review potentially false information. The approach has been scattershot and uneven, and critics have argued that third-party fact checkers have been unable to keep up with the billions of pieces of content on the social network.</p><p>Facebook has also said it would not allow posts that facilitated voter fraud or misinformation intended specifically to suppress voting.</p><p>  ''We're talking about this as if it's about fact-checking, but it's not,'' said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog. ''It's about whether platforms will facilitate fraud that undermines civic engagement.''</p><p>  In a statement, Facebook said it opposed modifying Section 230 because that would ''restrict more speech online, not less.''</p><p>  On Twitter, Mr. Dorsey fired back after Mr. Zuckerberg's comments became public before they were aired.</p><p>  ''This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth,''' he said of his decision to fact-check tweets. ''Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.''</p><p>  Kate Conger reported from Oakland, Calif., and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco.

The problem is, with each new innovation also comes risk. Whether it opens us up to new security issues or debates over our personal privacy, we're moving fast towards a future with a lot of unknowns.</p><p><br/> During TNW Conference 2019 top government officials, business and technology leaders and everyday technology users like you and me came together at The Assembly to discuss the growing privacy paradox. Hard Fork!<br/> Hard Fork? Hard Fork<br/> The talks centered around the biggest challenges society is facing today including: protecting data privacy; paving the way for the next billion internet users; the need for better collaboration in combating cybersecurity attacks; and trusting decentralization. Credit: Bas Losekoot Roundtable sessions during The Assembly<br/> Here are some highlights from each of the sessions: The data dilemma<br/> Today, data = gold. For companies, the vast amount of data they can now collect from users allows them to innovate, optimize and streamline their products and services, helping them compete in an increasingly crowded market.<br/> While this competition may fuel greater innovation, many are concerned that this comes at a heavy price. The Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed the vulnerability that comes with trusting companies with our user data.<br/> Last year GDPR, the most comprehensive data protection regulations to date, came into force. But some say this doesn't go far enough.<br/> Participants agreed that we need to introduce better regulations and inform citizens about the implications of their data transactions, enabling them to make informed decisions or find/create alternatives.<br/> The extent to which data is shared/exploited should be dependent on the benefit that can be offered to the citizen/consumer. Not the other way around.<br/> Citizens should easily be able to see, monetize and manage their own data. One table suggested that we need self-regulatory principles and a uniform platform that gives power to the people and clarity around the data value exchange. The next billion<br/> The barriers to technology are lowering, we're now at a stage when technology is becoming cheaper and more accessible to everyone. The next billion users are ready to connect and leverage the benefits that technology can bring. But this will bring both new opportunities and challenges.<br/> Many saw this as an opportunity for a clean slate. With the hard lessons we've learned already being shared and integrated into this new ecosystem, the next billion users can avoid some of our past mistakes.<br/> At the same time, exploitation was a major concern.<br/> We must improve transparency and usability for the next billion to stimulate equality of opportunities and avoid mass markets taking over from local providers. Instead of rolling out new tech fast for quick corporate benefits, we need to ensure sufficient feedback loops are incorporated to avoid unintended consequences.<br/> This is a moment that should be shaped by the next billion users themselves. Instead of dictating, we need to provide them with the support and partnerships they need to become tech creators and use technology to take ownership of their own destiny. Cyberterrorism<br/> In our interconnected world, cybersecurity threats can't be combated alone. Hits like the WannaCry ransomware cyber attack which threatened the NHS, Telefonica, Renault and Deutsche Bahn, exposed the dire need for better security collaboration.<br/> We must ensure everyone has a common understanding of cyber terrorism in order to create urgency and be prepared with fast coordinated responses.<br/> All companies, especially big tech, need to understand their influencing power and drive awareness of the risks vs. benefits to increase user responsibility and minimize the abuse of data systems.<br/> We need to support cybersecurity with investment and better tech policies. We need measured and proportional solutions to cyber threats from nation states including:<br/> Education ? 2. Regulation ? 3. Sanction ? 4. Rules of counter strike.<br/> Trusting decentralization<br/> At the moment, we rely on centralized institutions like banks, governments and tech giants such as Google and Facebook to keep data accurate, accessible and safe. But this hasn't always boded well for us.<br/> The massive collapse of both Lehman Brothers and Enron was hidden by internal accounting gimmicks until there was no choice but to file for bankruptcy, resulting in the loss of trillions of dollars in market capitalization.<br/> In a centralized system, internet shutdowns and censorship can be used by governments to cut access to opposition voices. Just this year the government of Venezuela was able to shut down people's access to CNN, the BBC, social media, YouTube and Google services because the country's system runs on centralized ISPs.<br/> Amid the major data security issues Facebook is already facing, the tech giant recently confirmed reports that it was storing hundreds of millions of account passwords in plain text. This means that some 2,000 Facebook engineers and developers could have easily accessed users' personal information.<br/> New technologies like blockchain are bringing promises of a more decentralized future. This means that, instead of having to put our trust in large institutions, we could be moving towards a future in which our transactions are transparent and monitored by a p2p network.<br/> But will our data actually be safer on a decentralized network?<br/> The keynote speaker on this topic, Jon Matonis, Founding Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, thinks so. Credit: Bas Losekoot Jon Matonis Trust in a trustless system<br/> Decentralization is bringing us into a new virtual wild west. It's based on the emergence of systems with short-lived histories and very little regulation. Everyone from individuals to governments to large institutions is questioning whether they should actually trust decentralized systems like Bitcoin to keep their assets safe.<br/> \"Blockchain is based on probabilistic security, it relates to something called Byzantine Fault Tolerance - it's what the system depends on in a decentralized future. Nuclear power plants, modern jet systems, and blockchain are all fault tolerant. This means that when a cyber attack happens, you're going to want to use the blockchain.\" Matonis explained.<br/> Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a problem in which several generals want to invade a neighboring enemy but need to coordinate their attack in order to be successful. This requires them to reach a consensus via messenger. The problem is, one general could be a traitor and pass on the wrong information to the next general.<br/> Blockchain solves this problem by introducing an algorithm called 'Proof-of-work'. Each time a general (or in the case of cryptocurrencies, miner) wants to submit a new block they have to demonstrate proof-of-work and gain a consensus from the other miners. As long as ? of the miners are honest, a consensus can be reached.<br/> The irony is that, instead of building more trust, blockchain essentially creates a trustless system in which consensus and trust in code replaces the need to place trust in a single entity.<br/> According to Matonis, \"It's not so much that it has to be the correct answer, it's just that everyone has to agree on the same answer and it has to be the answer with the highest probability of being correct.\"<br/> Public decentralized blockchains make the handling of our data more transparent, democratic and secure than ever, but is it completely safe? Blockchain is more difficult but not impossible to hack<br/> Hacking a blockchain system isn't impossible, but it's complicated enough to make it not even worth the time, money and computational power needed to overturn the system. For example, the mining power needed to hack Bitcoin would cost over $260,000 per hour.<br/> Still, this doesn't mean it hasn't been done. Blockchains can be compromised if hackers gain 51% control of the network's computing power. Recently, the well-known Ethereum Classic suffered a $1 million hack.<br/> But most hacks have been done through cryptocurrency exchanges and online wallets. There is however one method which has been used to return lost coins. After losing $40 million worth of ether in 2016, a DAO fund created by Slock.it hard forked in order to return lost tokens to their owners. But the decision to hard fork can only be made based on consensus.<br/> This brings us to yet another complex trade-off between centralization and decentralization. Resilience vs reliability<br/> While there are new security risks involved, Matonis explained, \"A network is only good if it's resilient.\"<br/> Unlike centralized systems, blockchain cannot be shut down or changed at the will of third parties. In a centralized system, it's governments and internal stakeholders who take the decision to shut down, bail out or place new legislation on our data and assets.<br/> As we saw in the case of the DAO fund hack, in a decentralized system, changes can only be made through consensus.<br/> \"For a while, we've had p2p file sharing - such as Pirate Bay - you can shut down directories, you can put teenagers in jail for downloading Hollywood films, but nobody can stop p2p file sharing because it's a decentralized movement, it has resiliency. And believe me, if governments could have shut down p2p file sharing they would have already, but you would have to shut down the entire internet,\" Matonis explained. Not a perfect system but a new option<br/> Decentralization is still not a perfect solution. At the moment blockchain systems can only process 3-7 transactions per second, meanwhile, traditional banks can handle around 2,000. It also requires a large amount of computing power to run.<br/> At the same time, the trade-offs involved and the new innovations happening every day are making it a more attractive solution for certain aspects of our data protection.<br/> Major banks such as Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, are exploring the opportunities decentralized technology can bring to financial services. Large companies are using it to work more transparently with suppliers and reduce food waste. Meanwhile, aid organizations are using the technology to create digital IDs, enabling refugees and victims of war to access basic needs.<br/> According to Matonis, \"We're coming to a crossroads between a centralized and decentralized future and it's going to evolve over a period of time.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-n11038906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB1-CHW1-JBYT-H4TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4IH</classCode><className>PRODUCT INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

The problem is, with each new innovation also comes risk. Whether it opens us up to new security issues or debates over our personal privacy, we're moving fast towards a future with a lot of unknowns.  During TNW Conference 2019[1] top government officials, business and technology leaders and everyday technology users like you and me came together at The Assembly[2] to discuss the growing privacy paradox.  The talks centered around the biggest challenges society is facing today including: protecting data privacy; paving the way for the next billion internet users; the need for better collaboration in combating cybersecurity attacks; and trusting decentralization.Credit: Bas Losekoot      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/06/12/addressing-the-privacy-paradox-top-leaders-and-experts-share-insights/#Roundtable\">https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/06/12/addressing-the-privacy-paradox-top-leaders-and-experts-share-insights/#Roundtable</url> sessions during The Assembly Here are some highlights from each of the sessions:The data dilemmaToday, data = gold. </p><p>For companies, the vast amount of data they can now collect from users allows them to innovate, optimize and streamline their products and services, helping them compete in an increasingly crowded market.  While this competition may fuel greater innovation, many are concerned that this comes at a heavy price. The Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed the vulnerability that comes with trusting companies with our user data.  Last year GDPR, the most comprehensive data protection regulations to date, came into force. But some say this doesn't go far enough.  Participants agreed that we need to introduce better regulations and inform citizens about the implications of their data transactions, enabling them to make informed decisions or find/create alternatives.  The extent to which data is shared/exploited should be dependent on the benefit that can be offered to the citizen/consumer. Not the other way around.  Citizens should easily be able to see, monetize and manage their own data. One table suggested that we need self-regulatory principles and a uniform platform that gives power to the people and clarity around the data value exchange.The next billionThe barriers to technology are lowering, we're now at a stage when technology is becoming cheaper and more accessible to everyone. The next billion users are ready to connect and leverage the benefits that technology can bring. But this will bring both new opportunities and challenges.  Many saw this as an opportunity for a clean slate. With the hard lessons we've learned already being shared and integrated into this new ecosystem, the next billion users can avoid some of our past mistakes.  At the same time, exploitation was a major concern.  We must improve transparency and usability for the next billion to stimulate equality of opportunities and avoid mass markets taking over from local providers. Instead of rolling out new tech fast for quick corporate benefits, we need to ensure sufficient feedback loops are incorporated to avoid unintended consequences. This is a moment that should be shaped by the next billion users themselves. Instead of dictating, we need to provide them with the support and partnerships they need to become tech creators and use technology to take ownership of their own destiny. CyberterrorismIn our interconnected world, cybersecurity threats can't be combated alone. Hits like the WannaCry ransomware cyber attack which threatened the NHS, Telef\u00f3nica, Renault and Deutsche Bahn, exposed the dire need for better security collaboration.  We must ensure everyone has a common understanding of cyber terrorism in order to create urgency and be prepared with fast coordinated responses.  All companies, especially big tech, need to understand their influencing power and drive awareness of the risks vs. benefits to increase user responsibility and minimize the abuse of data systems. We need to support cybersecurity with investment and better tech policies. We need measured and proportional solutions to cyber threats from nation states including:  Education \u2192 2. Regulation \u2192 3. Sanction \u2192 4. Rules of counter strike.Trusting decentralizationAt the moment, we rely on centralized institutions like banks, governments and tech giants such as Google and Facebook to keep data accurate, accessible and safe. But this hasn't always boded well for us.  The massive collapse of both Lehman Brothers and Enron was hidden by internal accounting gimmicks[3] until there was no choice but to file for bankruptcy, resulting in the loss of trillions of dollars in market capitalization.  In a centralized system, internet shutdowns and censorship can be used by governments to cut access to opposition voices. Just this year the government of Venezuela was able to shut down people's access[4] to CNN, the BBC, social media, YouTube and Google services because the country's system runs on centralized ISPs.  Amid the major data security issues Facebook is already facing, the tech giant recently confirmed reports that it was storing hundreds of millions of account passwords[5] in plain text. This means that some 2,000 Facebook engineers and developers could have easily accessed users' personal information.  New technologies like blockchain are bringing promises of a more decentralized future. This means that, instead of having to put our trust in large institutions, we could be moving towards a future in which our transactions are transparent and monitored by a p2p network.  But will our data actually be safer on a decentralized network?  The keynote speaker on this topic, Jon Matonis, Founding Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, thinks so. Credit: Bas Losekoot<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/06/12/addressing-the-privacy-paradox-top-leaders-and-experts-share-insights/#Jon\">https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/06/12/addressing-the-privacy-paradox-top-leaders-and-experts-share-insights/#Jon</url> MatonisTrust in a trustless systemDecentralization is bringing us into a new virtual wild west. It's based on the emergence of systems with short-lived histories and very little regulation. Everyone from individuals to governments to large institutions is questioning whether they should actually trust decentralized systems like Bitcoin to keep their assets safe.  'Blockchain is based on probabilistic security, it relates to something called Byzantine Fault Tolerance - it's what the system depends on in a decentralized future. Nuclear power plants, modern jet systems, and blockchain are all fault tolerant. This means that when a cyber attack happens, you're going to want to use the blockchain.' Matonis explained.  Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a problem in which several generals want to invade a neighboring enemy but need to coordinate their attack in order to be successful. This requires them to reach a consensus via messenger. The problem is, one general could be a traitor and pass on the wrong information to the next general.  Blockchain solves this problem by introducing an algorithm called 'Proof-of-work'[6]. Each time a general (or in the case of cryptocurrencies, miner) wants to submit a new block they have to demonstrate proof-of-work and gain a consensus from the other miners. As long as \u2154 of the miners are honest, a consensus can be reached.  The irony is that, instead of building more trust, blockchain essentially creates a trustless system in which consensus and trust in code replaces the need to place trust in a single entity.  According to Matonis, 'It's not so much that it has to be the correct answer, it's just that everyone has to agree on the same answer and it has to be the answer with the highest probability of being correct.' Public decentralized blockchains make the handling of our data more transparent, democratic and secure than ever, but is it completely safe?Blockchain is more difficult but not impossible to hackHacking a blockchain system isn't impossible, but it's complicated enough to make it not even worth the time, money and computational power needed to overturn the system. For example, the mining power needed to hack Bitcoin would cost over $260,000 per hour[7].  Still, this doesn't mean it hasn't been done. Blockchains can be compromised if hackers gain 51% control of the network's computing power. Recently, the well-known Ethereum Classic suffered a $1 million hack[8].  But most hacks have been done through cryptocurrency exchanges and online wallets. There is however one method which has been used to return lost coins. After losing $40 million worth of ether in 2016, a DAO fund created by Slock.it hard forked[9] in order to return lost tokens to their owners. But the decision to hard fork can only be made based on consensus.  This brings us to yet another complex trade-off between centralization and decentralization.Resilience vs reliabilityWhile there are new security risks involved, Matonis explained, 'A network is only good if it's resilient.' Unlike centralized systems, blockchain cannot be shut down or changed at the will of third parties. In a centralized system, it's governments and internal stakeholders who take the decision to shut down, bail out or place new legislation on our data and assets.  As we saw in the case of the DAO fund hack, in a decentralized system, changes can only be made through consensus.  'For a while, we've had p2p file sharing - such as Pirate Bay - you can shut down directories, you can put teenagers in jail for downloading Hollywood films, but nobody can stop p2p file sharing because it's a decentralized movement, it has resiliency. And believe me, if governments could have shut down p2p file sharing they would have already, but you would have to shut down the entire internet,' Matonis explained.Not a perfect system but a new optionDecentralization is still not a perfect solution. At the moment blockchain systems can only process 3-7 transactions per second, meanwhile, traditional banks can handle around 2,000. It also requires a large amount of computing power to run.  At the same time, the trade-offsinvolved and the new innovations happening every day are making it a more attractive solution for certain aspects of our data protection.  Major banks such as Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, are exploring the opportunities decentralized technology can bring to financial services. Large companies are using it to work more transparently with suppliers and reduce food waste. Meanwhile, aid organizations are using the technology to create digital IDs, enabling refugees and victims of war to access basic needs.  According to Matonis, 'We're coming to a crossroads between a centralized and decentralized future and it's going to evolve over a period of time.'

Open banking regulations from Europe to Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and - soon - Canada are fragmenting traditional retail asset and liability gathering in most markets. Open banking - a term for common interfaces among banks and other third parties to facilitate more competition - creates new business opportunities.</p><p>For decades, banks sought to become more \"vertical\", offering services from top to bottom. Now many new entrants want to be \"horizontal\", dominating a lucrative speciality.</p><p>They're going after things like account aggregation (like Yolt in the UK) or back-office enablement (Cross River in the US and Clear Bank in the UK). Some are seizing upon esoterica - \"The Narrow Bank\" arbitrages the US Federal Reserve deposit rate for corporate depositors.</p><p>In response to open banking, the UK already has 62 registered third-party providers, all of whom plan to take advantage of a fragmenting value chain.</p><p>Stripe, a seven-year-old specialist payments operation, now commands a valuation within touching distance of Deutsche Bank - a sign that horizontal can be very attractive. We will undoubtedly see more fragmentation in 2019 - along with efforts to re-bundle the components.</p><p>2 Banks will be keen to justify a \"future premium\". Banks are taking a cue from tech firms, whether Amazon or some start-up that has mastered the art of telling investors a compelling story about the future. Confidence in the business model evolution can command a future premium of more than 50% on current valuations.</p><p>We are beginning to see a similar phenomenon emerge among traditional banks.</p><p>Effective storytelling by BBVA and JP Morgan Chase has resulted in a future premium of around 25%.</p><p>Digital leaders among the traditional banks are going to need to show that the investment, creativity and ambition that built their premium valuation has resulted in higher returns.</p><p>If they can't, the digital bubbles may burst.</p><p>3 Banks will move to AI that won't nag. Verbal AI banking capabilities, like Bank of America's Erica, have fast become table stakes. But what passes for advice often feels like scolding. So banks are trying to offer more financial wellness advice that doesn't feel like nagging.</p><p>4 The sun may begin setting on \"community banking\". Banks with a compelling digital customer experience are winning.</p><p>In deposits, the big three - Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo - have only 24% of US branches, but took nearly half of new deposit-account openings last year.</p><p>Community banks have half the branches but saw only 20% of the deposit growth of the past three years.</p><p>5 The Chinese will keep going mobile - pulling the rest of us along. In a stunning transformation of retail financial services in China, Alipay and WeChat pay now have well over a billion regular users of mobile payments and conduct two-thirds of all global mobile payment transactions.</p><p>Western bankers who dismiss what is happening are making a mistake. Thousands of Finnish merchants now accept QR code-based mobile payments. Chinese influence is changing mobile payments in Singapore, which is adopting QR for low-value payments, and shaping India's through Ant Financial's stake in market leader PayTm.</p><p>6 Accenture research shows that the UK is the most disrupted traditional banking market, with 15% of revenue and over a third of new revenue going to new entrants. The combination of eroded trust and a regulator keen to stimulate competition has seen a plethora of new financial institutions appear, including Monzo, Starling, N29, Revolut and Goldman's Marcus.</p><p>Market share data in 2019 will start to give us an indication of whether the new entrants have enough momentum to win long-term or if the counter-attack of the traditional banking industry will be strong enough to fight off this incursion from the digital newcomers.</p><p>7 Banks will keep leaving legacy core systems behind. The prediction last year was that most big banks would stop short of ripping out their antiquated core legacy systems, looking instead to wrap them in digital services that enabled more speed and agility.</p><p>8 Banks keep pushing into the computing cloud. This past year the debate quickly moved from the benefits of moving into the cloud to operating effectively within it.</p><p>We are moving to a world where every banking carpenter will have the same toolbox and access to many of the same raw materials, but some will be capable of building beautiful furniture that customers will pay a premium for. Knowing how to create something of value rather than just having the right tools is what will matter in 2019.</p><p>9 The boundaries between banking and the rest of the digital economy will continue to blur. There's reason to think that Amazon and the rest of big tech will be forced to show their hands in banking.</p><p>In Europe, PSD2 will start to have an impact on the payments market. Major retailers will need to decide whether they want to offer account-to-account payments that bypass the card networks. In the US Uber, Amazon and Walmart are following Starbucks' focus on prepaid accounts that internalise payments by offering incentives to use proprietary apps.</p><p>10 Banks will stop all the loose talk about \"platforms\". A true digital platform business is an easily accessible two-sided marketplace that makes money by bringing buyers and sellers together and driving growth through network effects - think eBay, Airbnb and Uber. Amazon and Apple are only partly platform businesses. And Facebook and Google are almost pure aggregation businesses that focus on capturing your attention and then selling it to advertisers.</p><p>Jigyasa Singh is managing director for financial services at Accenture Africa and Alan McIntyre is senior managing director and head of Accenture's global banking practice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNTRIB-108489003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGY-6RH1-F091-R3VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Tribune (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 24, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

But Mark Zuckerberg is no ordinary tech entrepreneur - he has earned a bad reputation as the monopolist who oversaw egregious violations of user privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is natural for people to be wary of Zuckerberg's more recent efforts to bring more of the world's financial life onto his platform. However, the demonization and obstructionism he is facing in Washington is unfair and irresponsible - regulators shouldn't sacrifice an initiative with such massive humanitarian benefits just to score a few cheap political points. Washington should step up to the plate, offer the clear regulatory guidance needed to make Zuckerberg's vision a reality, and stop standing in the Libra's way.</p><p>The Libra is a revolutionary new cryptocurrency that promises to provide low-cost access to financial markets and payments systems to the 1.7 billion people without bank accounts. The Libra was originally proposed by Facebook and operates under the legally independent Libra Association, a myriad of nonprofits and payments firms like Mercy Corps and Mastercard that were assembled by Facebook. The Libra would be backed by a basket of traditional currencies like the dollar and the pound that would give it the stability needed to support everyday use. The IT infrastructure supporting the cryptocurrency would be centralized under the Libra Association and capable of supporting 1,000 transactions per second as compared to Bitcoin's mere seven. The CEO of Mercy Corps endorses Libra's potential to significantly increase the efficiency, transparency and accountability of foreign aid and the head of the Bank of England foresees healthy competition to the dollar's hegemony in international trade. The possibilities are endless.</p><p>Endless, too, is Washington's latest trail of criticisms. Responding to the Libra proposal, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) exclaimed, \"Do you really think people should trust Facebook with their hard-earned money? I just think that is delusional.\" President Donald Trump tweeted that unregulated cryptocurrencies are too volatile, that they facilitate the drug trade and that the Libra will have little standing. House Financial Services Committee chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) told Facebook to stop the Libra's development until big questions were answered, arguing that maybe Facebook should be broken up. Congressional House Democrats introduced a \"Keep Big Tech out of Finance Act\" that would fine large tech companies that offer online platform services $1 million a day for operating digital assets. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) went so far as to say that Zuckerberg \"needs to be an advocate for privacy and so he is creating a device which will provide privacy to drug dealers, human traffickers, terrorists, tax evaders and sanctions evaders.\"</p><p>This opposition is vindictive. For starters, the Libra would not be owned or managed by Facebook - it is under the governance of a legally independent, nonprofit Libra Association based in Switzerland. Calibra, the subsidiary that will manage the Libra, is not allowed to share customer data with Facebook. But unlike Bitcoin, Libra's servers are centralized under a corporate parent and can thereby accept government oversight of illicit activity on the platform. The currencies backing the Libra would save it from Bitcoin's volatility, and the lack of cryptocurrency regulation is the product of Washington's own negligence. Washington's latest play to the crowd's prejudices against Zuckerberg to take down the Libra is highly unethical and completely irresponsible.</p><p>Still, some of Washington's concerns are warranted. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sees a national security threat in the potential for money laundering abuse. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has raised valid concerns about terrorism and financial stability. As Facebook itself recognizes, these shortcomings in the latest iteration of Libra should be taken seriously. However, none of these problems are built into Libra's core concept. These challenges can be addressed by improving Libra's design and establishing a clear regulatory regime for the new cryptocurrency. These serious challenges from Washington regulators are not reasons to ditch the Libra - they are reasons to improve the Libra. Even still, PayPal, Mastercard and Visa have all left the Libra Association in the face of Washington's unreserved opposition to Zuckerberg's latest initiative. Washington regulators should couch their criticisms as constructive partners rather than obstructionist opponents to prevent other key partners from leaving the Libra Association.</p><p>While the Libra holds a lot of humanitarian promise for international finance, it will only see the light of day if Washington can find the strength of will to not settle for the easy political points and begin the hard policy work of building a clear regulatory framework for ambitious cryptocurrencies. After all, the stakes are higher than just the Libra: The future of innovation in financial technologies hangs in the balance. The Libra is one of the boldest financial technologies of our time and it is perfectly positioned to execute on its plan to democratize international finance. If the Libra Association cannot succeed in its mission to democratize international finance, it is hard to imagine who can.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4317104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF4-X4P1-DY7P-T129-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MERCY CORPS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A recurring question is whether they have any inherent ideological biases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his testimony to the Senate, Zuckerberg called Silicon Valley \"an extremely left-leaning place\". While voter patterns at the regional level and likely the employee level at tech companies suggest this is true, it would be wrong to classify Silicon Valley companies themselves as left-leaning, or with any kind of partisan bent.</p><p>Instead, the companies have more of an authoritarian-libertarian bias. This may have served the industry well in the past but is proving to be problematic now that the industry is so involved in our daily lives.</p><p>To see how Silicon Valley got here, I think back to my old professional experience in eBay's \"trust and safety\" division in 2004 and 2005. I was a part of a team that was wrestling with some of the same challenges that face the tech industry today \u2014 although it was a few years before social media and smartphones become part of the fabric of society.</p><p>Through the lens of 2018, some of eBay's initial values appear to be problematic, but they seemed noble and aspirational at the time \u2014 \"We believe people are basically good\" \"We believe everyone has something to contribute\".</p><p>At the time, the internet was seen as a democratising force for good, where everyone should be encouraged to participate. On eBay's platform, small sellers were allowed to compete on the same playing field as large \"power sellers\".</p><p>When the trust division was discussing rolling out a \"captcha\" test to ensure that there was an actual human logging into an account rather than a robot, a senior manager pointed out that the accessibility of eBay allowed some people with disabilities to run businesses. We needed to ensure that any of our policy changes didn't have adverse impacts on them \u2014 like a visual-only captcha test would have on users with limited vision.</p><p>Fraudsters</p><p>EBay was in a sense one of the first \"neutral platforms\" on the internet. This neutrality left the company vulnerable to fraud, as people who used eBay at the time can attest. Users didn't have to prove their identity to open an account.</p><p>There were groups of fraudsters, particularly in Romania and Nigeria, who would try to hack eBay accounts and dupe users into sending them money through payment platforms like Western Union. Yet the decision-makers at the top of the company were reluctant to implement hard policy changes that could combat that fraud, fearing it would both go against the company's values and hurt the company's growth.</p><p>It's not hard to see how the values that powered eBay in its early years have been adopted by Facebook and other companies. As Zuckerberg said in his testimony, \"Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company\".</p><p>Later, in response to a question from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas about whether Facebook was a neutral platform, Zuckerberg responded, \"We consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas.\" But \"all ideas\" implies there's a place both for polite discourse and hate speech.</p><p>Truly neutral platforms on sites like Facebook and Twitter would seem to avoid the issues of partisan bias that could be problematic for legislators, but such a libertarian ethos also allows for a lot of shenanigans. \"Neutral\" might eliminate one kind of bias but create other vulnerabilities that companies have been unsure how to address.</p><p>These firms are run like benevolent dictatorships, where we're forced to trust that CEOs will get it right. That structure is no accident. When companies like Facebook and Snap went public, they made sure that their CEOs would still have control of the companies through voting rights assigned to their stock. The Snap shares issued to the public have no voting rights at all.</p><p>Agitate for change</p><p>The rationale for CEOs having control is that they're better able to operate with the long term in mind rather than fickle, quarter-to-quarter public markets. But this structure also raises the question of how the public can agitate for change if it's not happy with how these companies are governed.</p><p>Big tech companies have shown that they're willing to respond to public pressure. The sight of Zuckerberg in a suit and tie in front of Congress speaks to that. And while the platforms claim to be neutral, they do have some internal standards; you won't see any nudity on Facebook, for instance.</p><p>But as these companies move from growth into maturity, it's hard to think monthly congressional hearings are realistic and appropriate. We're seeing the need for a different kind of corporate governance than Silicon Valley is used to.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/50/152379730245.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/50/152379730245.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-114384982</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3V-4F51-F11P-X112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

Unfortunately, they do not seek to relieve these nations' tax burden but rather to warn against \"tax havens.\" Along these \u00a0lines, last year the European Commission (EC) came up with the idea of a \"digital tax.\"</p><p><br/>In the name of pursuing the \"fair taxation of the digital economy,\" the\u00a0EC made two proposals: 1) taxing tech companies' profits \"where businesses have significant interaction with users through digital channels,\" regardless of whether they have a physical location in that nation; and 2) taxing \"the main digital activities that currently escape tax altogether in the EU.\"<br/>The lack of consensus among the governments may lead the EC to withdraw those proposals. Whereas countries like\u00a0Spain\u00a0and\u00a0France\u00a0support the idea (and have advocated similar measures), the\u00a0Irish, Swedish and Danish governments opposed the \"digital tax.\"\u00a0Nevertheless, Brussels supports the OECD's ongoing work to tax technological companies.<br/>Last January, the\u00a0OECD announced\u00a0that \"the international community has made important progress toward addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy and has agreed to continue working multilaterally towards achievement of a new, consensus-based, long-term solution in 2020.\"<br/>In a press release, the organization promised to focus on \"how the existing rules that divide up the right to tax the income of multinational enterprises among jurisdictions ... could be modified to take into account the changes that digitalization has brought to the world economy.\"<br/>It comes as little surprise that tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Uber, and Google\u00a0protested\u00a0the new tax. But so should everyone else. These taxes are not a good solution if we want Europe to lead new technological innovations and become a more prosperous continent.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Most leading tech companies are American or Asian, not European</emphasis><br/>The world's top 10 technological companies do not include a single European entity,\u00a0according\u00a0to the 2018 edition of Forbes Global 2000 List. Seven are American (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Intel, IBM, Facebook, and Oracle),while the rest are based in Asia (Samsung, Tencent Holdings, and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.).<br/>The only famous tech service that comes from Europe is Skype, which was written by a group of Estonian software developers. This is not a consequence of blind fate. What are the specific causes?<br/>The United States, South Korea, and Taiwan score high on the Heritage Foundation's\u00a0Index of Economic Freedom. Not only are their economies mostly free, but they are significantly freer on average than their European counterparts. The average tax burden in Europe is higher, and individual countries (such as France, Spain, Italy, and the Nordic countries) have levels of taxation or regulation proper to \"moderately free\" or \"mostly unfree\" economies.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The EU has punished competition and users' free choice</emphasis><br/>Google is the most used search engine in the world, except China. In all, 74 percent of internet searches go through Google,\u00a0according\u00a0to NetMarketShare. Competitors such as Bing and Yahoo have less than 10 percent of users. Most people think the Mountain View-based service gives them the most relevant results.<br/>Most users run Microsoft Windows as their operating system. Most smartphones have\u00a0installed\u00a0Android, a Linux-based system that is developed and maintained by Google. What has been the most common response of EU politicians?<br/>Many times they have charged Northern American companies like Google and Apple with \"monopolistic\" practices, although their \"hegemony\" is based on millions of users' preferences. They went as far as to try to launch their own alternative search portal. Some 14 years ago, French and German leaders Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der released a\u00a0publicly funded\u00a0alternative to Google named Quaero. But ultimately it\u00a0failed, in part because of disagreements over its development and lack of interest from Angela Merkel.<br/>Even when systems are offered, so far none has toppled the big tech companies from their respective perches. Nobody is prevented from using competitors' products like Ubuntu Mobile, DuckDuckGo, Debian, or Tails. The fact that few choose to do so is of little concern.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A more innovative Europe should steer clear of regulations and new digital taxes</emphasis><br/>If we want to live in a Europe that can attract more technological companies and lead\u00a0the development of new projects, we should not try to confiscate tech profits via taxation. Their actions will be more profitable than the huge amounts of (often\u00a0corruptly invested) EU funds, which have not boosted any kind of economic growth in the continent.<br/>EU nations need to repeal regulations, open up restrictive trade laws, and reduce taxes. We should not promote any kind of continental tax \"harmonization.\" Bureaucrats ought to let member states compete to attract investment from new companies. Decentralization is more prone to bring growth and economic freedom than socialism and centralization.<br/>Proper human flourishing cannot come from nations following Machiavellian policies to maximize their concentrated economic power. Development of technological industries must open new avenues for entrepreneurship, which aims to serve the needs of our fellow citizens. People may serve society by using these new platforms to discover new ways to boost productivity, make life easier for disabled people, improve medical procedures, and numerous other fronts.<br/>A lighter economic burden, and a less restrictive environment, facilitates technological advancement and yields new discoveries to benefit all God's creation.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-55734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRK1-F03R-W0JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Acton Institute, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Acton Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0007KA7</classCode><className>HON HAI PRECISION INDUSTRY CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009CXY</classCode><className>TENCENT HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

No, Space Rogue, Kingpin, Mudge and the others were hackers who had come from the mysterious environs of cyberspace to deliver a terrifying warning to the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your computers, they told the panel of senators in May 1998, are not safe - not the software, not the hardware, not the networks that link them together. The companies that build these things don't care, the hackers continued, and they have no reason to care because failure costs them nothing. And the federal government has neither the skill nor the will to do anything about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you're looking for computer security, then the Internet is not the place to be,\" said Mudge, then 27 and looking like a biblical prophet with long brown hair flowing past his shoulders. The Internet itself, he added, could be taken down \"by any of the seven individuals seated before you\" with 30 minutes of well-choreographed keystrokes.</p><p>The senators - a bipartisan group including John Glenn, Joseph I. Lieberman and Fred D. Thompson - nodded gravely, making clear that they understood the gravity of the situation. \"We're going to have to do something about it,\" Thompson said.</p><p>What happened instead was a tragedy of missed opportunity, and 17 years later the world is still paying the price in rampant insecurity.</p><p>The testimony from L0pht, as the hacker group called itself, was among the most audacious of a rising chorus of warnings delivered in the 1990s as the Internet was exploding in popularity, well on its way to becoming a potent global force for communication, commerce and criminality.</p><p>Hackers and other computer experts sounded alarms as the World Wide Web brought the transformative power of computer networking to the masses. This created a universe of risks for users and the critical real-world systems, such as power plants, rapidly going online as well.</p><p>Officials in Washington and throughout the world failed to forcefully address these problems as trouble spread across cyberspace, a vast new frontier of opportunity and lawlessness. Even today, many serious online intrusions exploit flaws in software first built in that era, such as Adobe Flash, Oracle's Java and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p><p>\"We have the same security problems,\" said Space Rogue, whose real name is Cris Thomas. \"There's a lot more money involved. There's a lot more awareness. But the same problems are still there.\"</p><p>L0pht, born of the bustling hacker scene in the Boston area, rose to prominence as a flood of new software was introducing such wonders as sound, animation and interactive games to the Web. This software, which required access to the core functions of each user's computer, also gave hackers new opportunities to manipulate machines from afar.</p><p>Breaking into networked computers became so easy that the Internet, long the realm of idealistic scientists and hobbyists, gradually grew infested with the most pragmatic of professionals: crooks, scam artists, spies and cyberwarriors. They exploited computer bugs for profit or other gain while continually looking for new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Tech companies sometimes scrambled to fix problems - often after hackers or academic researchers revealed them publicly - but few companies were willing to undertake the costly overhauls necessary to make their systems significantly more secure against future attacks. Their profits depended on other factors, such as providing consumers new features, not warding off hackers.</p><p>\"In the real world, people only invest money to solve real problems, as opposed to hypothetical ones,\" said Dan S. Wallach, a Rice University computer science professor who has been studying online threats since the 1990s. \"The thing that you're selling is not security. The thing that you're selling is something else.\"</p><p>The result was a culture within the tech industry often derided as \"patch and pray.\" In other words, keep building, keep selling and send out fixes as necessary. If a system failed - causing lost data, stolen credit card numbers or time-consuming computer crashes - the burden fell not on giant, rich tech companies but on their customers.</p><p>The members of L0pht say they often experienced this cavalier attitude in their day jobs, where some toiled as humble programmers or salesmen at computer stores. When they reported bugs to software makers, company officials often asked: Does anybody else know about this?</p><p>          Geek heaven in Boston loft          </p><p>The hackers met online, mostly on the bulletin boards that provided computer enthusiasts with freewheeling forums for trading tips, jokes and insights about how various systems worked - and in some cases could be made to do things their creators never intended. This is the essence of hacking. It is not inherently good or evil. It can be either, or in some cases a combination of both, depending on the motives of the hackers.</p><p>L0pht's members - the exact list shifted year to year but averaged seven or eight - shared a fascination with technology and a knack for testing its limits. They would decode the program running a piece of hardware or repeatedly flood a password field with too many characters, a hack known as a \"buffer overflow\" that often caused systems to fail, opening the door to further manipulation.</p><p>\"The difference between how it's supposed to work and how it really works is where the vulnerabilities happen,\" said Chris Wysopal, known as Weld Pond in his L0pht days.</p><p>The group's first clubhouse - and the inspiration for the name - was an actual loft above a carpentry shop in Boston's South End neighborhood, rented after the girlfriend of one of the hackers grew weary of all of the old computer gear littering their apartment (including several pieces resting semi-permanently in their bathroom).</p><p>Like the Internet itself, there seemed to be peril on the down-and-out streets all around L0pht's loft in the era before gentrification. But inside was geek heaven, with cast-off computers, a television, a couch, cold beer, a 1980s-vintage \"Battlezone\" arcade game and a curious array of second-hand mannequins wearing unusual adornments, including a skirt, a gas mask and the charred remnants of a police uniform that the hackers found. In a stroke of luck, the landlord paid the electrical bill each month, keeping an endless lifeline of electrons flowing to what amounted to a power-hungry computer lab.</p><p>\"It was totally scary to get there, but once you got there it was like, 'Ahhhhh,' \" recalled Joe Grand, a mischievous skateboarding enthusiast who was L0pht's youngest member. \"It really was a refuge in a lot of ways. It really shaped my life.\"</p><p>Much of the gear they used - and tried to bend to their wills - had been collected from dumpsters around the tech-heavy Boston area. L0pht's members refurbished some hardware to sell at flea markets to help pay the bills, but they kept the most useful pieces, including a giant VAX computer - a hunk of 1970s-vintage technology featuring two units, each the size of a washing machine - that they somehow hauled up steep stairs and into the loft.</p><p>They came to particularly disdain what they considered security-by-checklist, when companies declared a product safe merely because they had implemented a specified number of standard features, such as passwords and basic cryptography. \"We'd say, 'Give us one. We're going to try to break into it,' \" recalled Wysopal.</p><p>They almost always did, usually after toiling late into the night in a frenzy of discovery, flooding systems with inputs that programmers had not anticipated or in any way prepared for. Paul Nash, whose hacker name was Silicosis, once discovered that he could knock computers using Microsoft's Windows operating systems offline by sending a single command - a trick he happily showed off to visitors.</p><p>When members of L0pht weren't trying to find their own bugs, they were supporting others in doing so, including through regular gatherings at a Boston bar in which anyone who revealed a new computer vulnerability got a free beer. L0pht also spread the word about security discoveries though the Hacker News Network, a popular online newsletter run by Space Rogue, a born tinkerer who had rigged up makeshift flashlights so he could read in bed at night as a kid. (He still routinely uses his hacker name today).</p><p>Hacker News Network grew popular enough that it drew interest from advertisers. The group didn't want to sully its main Web site, L0pht.com, but was happy to collect revenue from Hacker News Network. One of the earliest ads touted the availability, for a fee, of Russian brides.</p><p>          Exposing bugs for all to see          </p><p>L0pht partially embraced the bad-boy image of hackers, calling themselves \"gray hats,\" a middle ground between the avowedly virtuous \"white hat\" hackers and the openly outlaw \"black hats.\" The group took particular relish in trying to shame big companies, such as Microsoft, for selling products with security flaws to unsuspecting customers.</p><p>When L0pht discovered a way to crack the cryptography protecting user passwords for the Windows operating system, Mudge publicly chastised Microsoft for what he called \"kindergarten crypto\" and, along with Wysopal, created an easy-to-use software tool to help anyone defeat it. </p><p>L0pht member Dildog developed a program with another hacker group, called Cult of the Dead Cow, to remotely control office networks running Microsoft software. The name, a spoof on the company's popular \"BackOffice Server 2000\" program, was \"Back Orifice 2000\"; the promotional materials featured an equally crude logo.</p><p>But the reality of L0pht was more conventional than the public image. </p><p>Wysopal was a programmer for Lotus. Space Rogue and two others worked at CompUSA, a chain store. Several had jobs at BBN Technologies, a venerable tech company that years earlier helped build the most important forerunner to the Internet, a Pentagon-funded project called the ARPANET.</p><p>The men used their hacker names mainly because they feared getting fired if their employers learned of their nocturnal activities. (The other reason, nearly as important, was that they wanted to make it harder for companies facing embarrassing disclosures to sue them or call the cops - real threats, then and now, for anyone doing freelance security research.)</p><p>The day jobs also provided an insider view of the burgeoning tech industry, helping the hackers find bugs in widely used business or consumer products. Companies that seemed unresponsive to complaints through formal channels often found themselves in L0pht's cross hairs. The group maintained open lines to legions of other hackers - including those working inside big tech firms - and developed disdain for a business culture they say put profit above security.</p><p>\"It's get it up, get it running as fast as we can. Let's make some money,\" Nash said. \"There's this tremendous push to get code out the door, and we'll fix it later.\"</p><p>L0pht also came to doubt the eagerness of companies to fix flaws even after they had been discovered. In the early years of the group, reports to official company e-mail addresses - purportedly established to solicit security concerns - often seemed to just disappear into a black hole. A particular offender, L0pht members said, was <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:secure@microsoft.com\">secure@microsoft.com</email></p><p>They eventually discovered a reliable way to get companies' attention: Security alerts posted on L0pht.com drew notice from the world's technology journalists and eventually the companies themselves.</p><p>The downside was that plenty of \"black hat\" hackers also monitored L0pht's alerts, giving them time to take advantage of bugs before companies could possibly fix them. There's no way to know how many intrusions this aided, but the members of L0pht were unapologetic.</p><p>\"We always thought that if we knew about it, other people probably know about it and are exploiting it,\" said Grand, formerly known as Kingpin.</p><p>          Bill Gates rides 'Tidal Wave'          </p><p>The 1993 arrival of the first widely popular Web browser, Mosaic, made the Internet an unstoppable cultural and commercial force. Suddenly it wasn't an exotic, far-off wonderland for the technically adept. Anybody could \"surf the Web.\"</p><p>Over the next several years, sophisticated new programming languages such as Flash and Java dramatically expanded browsers'\u2002capabilities. Web sites began streaming video. Classic games such as \"Frogger,\" \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Tetris\" could be played, free of charge, on any computer that could get online.</p><p>For most users, these new features seemed almost magical. They appeared automatically, perhaps requiring just a click or two of a mouse. Soon, most computers in the world had Flash and similar programming languages on their hard drives.</p><p>Surging consumer interest was not lost on Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who penned a confidential memo to his top executives in May 1995 titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave.\" The 5,500-word document demanded in sweeping, urgent terms that the company compete forcefully in the explosive new online marketplace.</p><p>\"The next few years are going to be very exciting as we tackle these challenges and opportunities,\" Gates wrote. \"The Internet is a tidal wave. It changes the rules. It is an incredible opportunity as well as incredible challenge. I am looking forward to your input on how we can improve our strategy to continue our track record of incredible success.\"</p><p>Gates did warn about the importance of security in the memo, saying \"Our plans for security need to be strengthened.\" But he also said, \"I want every product plan to try and go overboard on Internet features.\"</p><p>This priority, many critics would later say, was the most important one to Microsoft, planting the seeds of what security experts called \"featuritis\" - a common malady in which new features are added more quickly than they can be made secure.</p><p>This rush to innovate, to make every Microsoft product essentially an Internet product, was felt deeply throughout the company, said Billy Brackenridge, a Microsoft program manager during the 1990s. The ability to deliver new features for the company's marquee operating systems and software determined who got stock options - a key motivator for a company whose stock split seven times that decade amid a total gain of more than 9,000 percent.</p><p>\"There may have been one or two guys who really cared [about security]. For the most part, it was, 'Get it out the door,' \" Brackenridge recalled. \"If we missed a date, that was real money. . . . If your feature didn't get in, you didn't get stock.\"</p><p>Microsoft's competitive juices fueled a furious push to develop a browser to challenge the primacy of Netscape Navigator, which was produced largely by the same team of programmers who had created Mosaic. By the mid-1990s, Navigator had more than 70 percent market share, Gates warned in his memo.</p><p>The Microsoft answer was to create Internet Explorer and to integrate the browser extensively with its dominant Windows operating system. This effort was central to the Justice Department's antitrust charges against Microsoft, which were settled in 2001.</p><p>But it had other effects more immediately noticeable to L0pht and other hackers.</p><p>As Microsoft worked to infuse Internet-related features into its products, the company created portals for hackers to discover and exploit. A particularly notorious one was a programming language called ActiveX, which like Flash and Java reached deeply into the brains of a user's computer.</p><p>\"Once you go to a Web site and download some code and it executes itself . . . you have a whole new type of problem,\" said Giovanni Vigna, a computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara and co-founder of Lastline, a security company. </p><p>\"Now I have running code on your machine, and I can do all sorts of interesting things.\"</p><p>          700 users, 1 bad password           </p><p>At a hacker conference in August 1997, Mudge - whose real name is Peiter Zatko and who infused a zeal for showmanship into L0pht - visibly delighted in tweaking Microsoft as he described cracking the password security on Windows, at the time the standard operating system for business and government computers worldwide.</p><p>\"I don't want to be working on Microsoft products right now,\" Mudge declared. \"The problem is: They're everywhere! You cannot get away from them!\"</p><p>He singled out a particularly egregious security flaw - splitting a strong 14-character password field into two much weaker seven-character passwords for storage. The longer a password, the more combinations a hacker must try to break it. But Microsoft, Mudge reported, had undermined that principle by creating, in essence, two shorter and easily cracked passwords instead of one strong one.</p><p>Worse still, if the user had picked a password that was seven characters or fewer, the system stored a telltale string of characters to represent the unused portion of the password field. When hackers found this string, they knew that they already had the password halfway cracked. Mudge happily recited the odd combination of letters and numbers at the conference, with dozens of hackers looking on.</p><p>\"I'm going to get that tattooed across my forehead and walk through the halls of Microsoft!\" he said to laughter from the crowd.</p><p>He also announced that L0pht had discovered that a single password - \"CHANGEME\" - was being used by 700 users of one network the group studied.</p><p>Such antics drew fans within the hacker world, a hint of wider celebrity and the first whiff of money. L0pht sold T-shirts bearing its logo at conferences and also began selling its tool for cracking Windows passwords - called L0pht Crack - for $50 to system administrators eager to test the strength of passwords on the networks they managed.</p><p>When the members of L0pht realized how much security consultants were charging for such services, they raised the price to $150, then $500. (One of the buyers was the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency that chronicled failings of federal IT systems).</p><p>For all L0pht's drive to break systems online, members had long run their club with a certain formality. They had regular meetings, set collective priorities and handled financial matters carefully. </p><p>Each hacker had his own desk and paid $100 a month toward rent; those who couldn't afford that would share desks and pay half as much.</p><p>But the money rushing into computer security got their attention. They got a first taste of it when the online ads along with sales of T-shirts and L0pht Crack meant that members no longer had to reach as deeply into their own pockets for rent or other costs. They also noticed how a rising generation of security consultants - including some doing \"stress testing\" using tactics much like L0pht's - were getting big paydays.</p><p>By the time L0pht appeared before the Senate in 1998, the idea of starting a real company - and earning enough profit to quit their day jobs - was starting to form within the group.</p><p>\"You know,\" Space Rogue remembered thinking, \"maybe we should get a piece of that.\"</p><p>This was the beginning of the end for L0pht.</p><p>          A close call at the NSA          </p><p>They had an uproariously fun trip to Washington for the Senate testimony, renting a dark green, 15-passenger van and installing an array of antennas on the roof to see what signals they could pick up along the way.</p><p>This seemed like harmless hacker fun until they made a stop at the National Cryptologic Museum, on the grounds of the National Security Agency in suburban Maryland. Zatko had visited the NSA several times before, he said, part of gradual move into federal government work. \"I wanted them to have sensitivities, to know that hackers aren't the bad guys,\" he explained later.</p><p>But on this trip, Zatko accidentally directed the L0pht van, its roof bristling with interception equipment, to the entrance of a secure area of the NSA campus. Driving the van was L0pht member Stefan von Neumann, who appeared confused when he pulled up to a checkpoint manned by an armed military guard. When the guard saluted von Neumann, whose real name is Stefan Wuensch, he asked his fellow hackers, \"What should I do?\"</p><p>In unison, they shouted, \"Salute back!\"</p><p>But once on the grounds of the famously secret spy agency, the members of L0pht quickly grew uneasy and urged von Neumann to exit the grounds as quickly as possible. He soon did, getting the van to the museum, then onward to Washington without further incident.</p><p>The hackers testified the following day before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, whose staffers told L0pht that only members of federal witness protection programs had previously been allowed to testify using aliases. The hackers then took a tour of the White House, guided by National Security Council counterterrorism official Richard A. Clarke.</p><p>A cover story in Internet Week magazine, featuring Wysopal and Zatko (a.k.a. Weld Pond and Mudge), finally blew their cover at work, but they weren't fired as they had feared. The New York Times Magazine also featured L0pht in a story, as did PBS and MTV. The hackers' boasts about being able to take down the Internet in 30 minutes - by exploiting flaws in a key Internet routing protocol called BGP - prompted mentions from Conan O'Brien and Rush Limbaugh, who called them \"long-haired nerd computer hackers.\"</p><p>Even the makers of Trivial Pursuit took notice. Question: What did a group of geeks called L0pht tell the U.S. Senate they could cripple in 30 minutes?</p><p>Answer: The Internet.</p><p>By the time that edition of the game hit the stores in 2000, L0pht was no longer L0pht. The hackers had joined @Stake, a security company built largely on L0pht's fame and $10 million in venture-capital funding. They quit their day jobs to finally pursue their nocturnal hobby full time.</p><p>But they also acquired an unwelcome new set of rules and responsibilities - especially to clients who were happy to pay for their expertise but didn't fancy getting publicly roasted whenever the hackers discovered problems.</p><p>\"The community we came from thought we were selling out to the Man, which of course we were,\" Wysopal recalled.</p><p>Among the biggest companies to hire @Stake - and demand nondisclosure agreements about what they found - was L0pht's longtime nemesis: Microsoft.</p><p>          Dropping the ax          </p><p>As business realities set in, Space Rogue was the first casualty. He had run the operations side of L0pht and also Hacker News Network. But the venture capitalists had their own operational guys, and they weren't keen on publicly affiliating themselves with the word \"hacker.\"</p><p>So the online newsletter became a sanitized corporate Web site called \"Security News Network,\" and Space Rogue got a job in @Stake's marketing department - far from the center of gravity where Mudge, Kingpin, Weld Pond and the others worked. Space Rogue was fired soon after.</p><p>The company confiscated his laptop computer and unceremoniously escorted him out the door for reasons he says he still doesn't understand. By the time Space Rogue got home, his L0pht.com accounts had been shut down. He had no idea - and still doesn't - whether any of his fellow hackers spoke up for him or fought the firing.</p><p>\"That was a bad part of my life. . . . I lost six of my best friends,\" Space Rogue recalled. \"It was really devastating to me. It took me a long time to recover from that.\"</p><p>The dot-com bubble, which had pushed tech companies' valuations into the stratosphere, burst about the same time, sweeping away weak companies like Pets.com and squeezing revenue throughout the industry. The chief executive of @Stake, who was brought in to provide something like parental supervision to L0pht, ordered Wysopal to single out a member of the group for a layoff in order to balance out cuts elsewhere in the company.</p><p>Wysopal said he reluctantly dropped the ax on Brian Oblivion, one of L0pht's charter members, whose real name is Brian Hassick. The firing came the day before Hassick's son was to be baptized; he and Wysopal did not speak again for months.</p><p>As the bonds at the heart of L0pht deteriorated, Zatko mysteriously disappeared. Though not a founding member of the group, he had been its most public face during the rise to fame. </p><p>If L0pht was something akin to the Beatles of the hacker world - combining serious chops with an instinct for self-promotion - Zatko was the mercurial, boundary-busting John Lennon to Wysopal's even-keeled Paul McCartney.</p><p>But as @Stake struggled, Zatko developed severe anxiety, made worse by a bad reaction to medicine that was supposed to ease his symptoms, he said. Zatko ended up in a psychiatric ward for several days. None of the members of L0pht came to visit, a source of enduring frustration to him. (They say they didn't know what was happening, only that he was missing from work.)</p><p>\"The L0pht was my only family,\" Zatko recalled. \"It killed me. . . . It was absolutely atrocious.\"</p><p>Though Zatko gradually recovered, the decline of @Stake continued. Space Rogue threatened a lawsuit to reclaim lost wages and his remaining share of the initial venture-capital funding. (He eventually settled with enough to buy a car, cover his lawyer's fees and put a down payment on a condominium, he says.)</p><p>Perhaps an even lower point for @Stake came in September 2003, when the company fired its chief technology officer, the respected security guru Dan Geer, after he co-authored a study on how Microsoft's dominance of the software industry undermined security. Geer learned of his dismissal through a news release issued by @Stake, according to news reports at the time.</p><p>When Symantec, a larger security firm, bought the remains of @Stake in 2004, it was a mercy killing.</p><p>\"Everything we stood for had been nibbled away little by little by little until we were left with nothing,\" Grand said. \"We needed to be able to speak the truth about everybody. That didn't last very long. . . . Eventually we just got on our knees for everybody.\"</p><p>As L0pht was collapsing, security on the Internet took a turn for the worse. The waning days of the 20th century featured huge investments toward fixing the Y2K bug - based on the alarming possibility that programs designed to recognize years by only two digits, such as \"99,\" would suddenly crash when they saw \"00.\"</p><p>But the problems that would soon bedevil computing were not accidental, like the Y2K bug. The black hats were on the rise.</p><p>Among the first security disasters of the next decade, the ILOVEYOU worm arrived in May 2000 and apparently was the work of a pair of computer programmers from the Philippines. </p><p>The virus exploited a feature in Microsoft Outlook to send malicious code to each new victim's contact lists.</p><p>Soon, an estimated 10 percent of the world's computers were infected, snarling networks for the Pentagon, the British Parliament and many private companies. Estimates of damage and cleanup costs topped $20 billion. Many other worms - with names such as Pikachu, Anna Kournikova and Nimda - also exploited flaws in Microsoft products.</p><p>On Dec. 8, 2000, one day after the anniversary of the surprise Japanese attack on U.S. Navy forces in 1941, Clarke - the National Security Council official who had once given L0pht a tour of the White House - appeared at a conference organized by Microsoft. </p><p>He warned that if the government didn't improve computer security, the nation might suffer a \"digital Pearl Harbor.\"          </p><p>          'Hackers are like water'          </p><p>L0pht's legacy is a mixed one. The group was among the pioneers of a system called \"responsible disclosure,\" still widely used today, in which researchers who find bugs give companies a set amount of time to make fixes before security flaws are announced to the world. Some companies now go a step further, offering cash rewards called \"bug bounties\" to encourage hackers to search for problems - and ideally find them ahead of criminals and spies.</p><p>Microsoft eventually became more serious about security. It didn't have much choice: Major customers told Gates to either do better or lose their business. In a memo in January 2002 - something of a bookend to the one from 1995 - Gates declared that a new security initiative was \"the highest priority for all the work we are doing.\"</p><p>The move initially drew some skepticism. \"When I told friends I was going to Microsoft to do security . . . most of them laughed at me because I used 'Microsoft' and 'security' in the same sentence,\" said Scott Charney, a former Justice Department official hired in 2002. He is now corporate vice president for Trustworthy Computing at Microsoft.</p><p>Microsoft pulled thousands of engineers off of product development to overhaul the company's systems for designing and building software. Gates sent one group of officials to a retreat at a historic wooden home more commonly used for weddings, in nearby Bellevue, Wash., about a 15-minute drive from Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond. Charney said, \"Basically some people were sent there and told, don't come back until you have an answer.\"</p><p>But the Internet did not suddenly become secure. The company's newfound focus on security took years to bear fruit, most notably with the arrival of Windows Vista in 2006 and Office 2010 a few years later. Because of a need for \"backward compatibility\" - meaning older and newer versions of Microsoft products work easily together - old flaws lingered in the online world for many years after they were fixed in newly released software.</p><p>The federal government in the past year finally has replaced hundreds of thousands of computers running Windows XP - an operating system first released in 2001, months before Gates's call to arms on product security - after the company withdrew free support after nearly 13 years.</p><p>But as Microsoft's products became more secure, hackers began feasting on alternative targets that did not get similar overhauls.</p><p>\"Hackers are like water,\" said Vigna, the computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"They always go for the path of least resistance. . . . If you put a plug in place, they will find another crack.\"</p><p>At the root is an issue raised by L0pht in its Senate testimony: The business incentives within the tech industry favor growth over security. And once companies get big enough that security is a major concern - as eventually happened to Microsoft - it's extremely difficult to retrofit rigorous protections into systems built without them.</p><p>Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who chaired the Senate panel in 1998 and left Congress in 2003, said in a recent interview that Internet security is the kind of problem the government has trouble fixing. \"Number one, it's very difficult, and number two, there's no immediate political payoff for anyone.\"</p><p>          The rise of the black hats          </p><p>Some industry critics favor strict government standards and legal liability for failures, as long have existed for many critical offline systems such as cars, elevators and airplanes. Others would create an independent group, a tech industry equivalent to Underwriters Laboratories, which certifies the safety of electronic devices worldwide. Or perhaps insurance companies, which ultimately foot the bill for many cybersecurity incidents, may some day demand better safety practices from their clients, as insurers long have done for homes and cars.</p><p>But others have argued that demands for greater security could damp innovation and make tech products harder to use. Given the industry's increasingly central role in the national economy - and the massive expansion in tech lobbying power in Washington in recent years - tough new laws or regulations remain difficult to imagine.</p><p>\"The only way to get in front of the security problem is to build better software,\" said Gary McGraw, chief technology official for Cigital, a Northern Virginia-based firm that has worked on software security since the 1990s. \"Until we start building security in, we'll always play catch-up.\"</p><p>L0pht itself has rebounded a bit, releasing an updated version of L0pht Crack in 2009. The main Web site is still running, if a bit dated-looking. The Hacker News Network regained its name and its edge. </p><p>Wysopal and fellow L0pht hacker Dildog founded a security company, Veracode, in 2006. Zatko, after recovering from severe anxiety, rejoined BBN Technologies. He later spent three years directing cybersecurity research at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon agency that created the forerunner to the Internet decades ago, before becoming deputy director for a research team at Google.</p><p>Most of the others still work on computer security issues. They had a reunion of sorts in the summer of 2014 at Space Rogue's wedding in Philadelphia. The emotional wounds from the @Stake debacle have scarred over if not disappeared.</p><p>As for the security issues they once highlighted for the U.S. government and the world, the news is far worse. Hackers - the black-hat kind - have consistently outrun efforts to impose security.</p><p>Wysopal offered this grim precedent: Cities were once vulnerable to disastrous fires, which raged through dense clusters of mostly wooden buildings. It took a giant fire in Chicago to spur government officials into serious reforms, including limits on new wooden structures, a more robust water supply for suppressing blazes and an overhaul to the city's fire department.</p><p>\"The market didn't solve the problem of cities burning down,\" Wysopal said, predicting that Internet security may require a historic disaster to force change. \"It seems to me that the market isn't really going to solve this one on its own.\"</p><p>But here's a frightening fact: The push to create tough new fire-safety standards did not start after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, which killed hundreds of people and left 100,000 homeless. It took a second fire, nearly three years later in 1874, to get officials in Chicago to finally make real changes.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow The Post's tech blog, The Switch, where technology and policy connect.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-3797ebc80e0a11e5a0dc2b6f404ff5cf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G8Y-HCN1-DYX1-H18V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5663\"/><timeReceived>3:58 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 23, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

No, Space Rogue, Kingpin, Mudge and the others were hackers who had come from the mysterious environs of cyberspace to deliver a terrifying warning to the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your computers, they told the panel of senators in May 1998, are not safe - not the software, not the hardware, not the networks that link them together. The companies that build these things don't care, the hackers continued, and they have no reason to care because failure costs them nothing. And the federal government has neither the skill nor the will to do anything about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you're looking for computer security, then the Internet is not the place to be,\" said Mudge, then 27 and looking like a biblical prophet with long brown hair flowing past his shoulders. The Internet itself, he added, could be taken down \"by any of the seven individuals seated before you\" with 30 minutes of well-choreographed keystrokes.</p><p>The senators - a bipartisan group including John Glenn, Joseph I. Lieberman and Fred D. Thompson - nodded gravely, making clear that they understood the gravity of the situation. \"We're going to have to do something about it,\" Thompson said.</p><p>What happened instead was a tragedy of missed opportunity, and 17 years later the world is still paying the price in rampant insecurity.</p><p>The testimony from L0pht, as the hacker group called itself, was among the most audacious of a rising chorus of warnings delivered in the 1990s as the Internet was exploding in popularity, well on its way to becoming a potent global force for communication, commerce and criminality.</p><p>Hackers and other computer experts sounded alarms as the World Wide Web brought the transformative power of computer networking to the masses. This created a universe of risks for users and the critical real-world systems, such as power plants, rapidly going online as well.</p><p>Officials in Washington and throughout the world failed to forcefully address these problems as trouble spread across cyberspace, a vast new frontier of opportunity and lawlessness. Even today, many serious online intrusions exploit flaws in software first built in that era, such as Adobe Flash, Oracle's Java and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p><p>\"We have the same security problems,\" said Space Rogue, whose real name is Cris Thomas. \"There's a lot more money involved. There's a lot more awareness. But the same problems are still there.\"</p><p>L0pht, born of the bustling hacker scene in the Boston area, rose to prominence as a flood of new software was introducing such wonders as sound, animation and interactive games to the Web. This software, which required access to the core functions of each user's computer, also gave hackers new opportunities to manipulate machines from afar.</p><p>Breaking into networked computers became so easy that the Internet, long the realm of idealistic scientists and hobbyists, gradually grew infested with the most pragmatic of professionals: crooks, scam artists, spies and cyberwarriors. They exploited computer bugs for profit or other gain while continually looking for new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Tech companies sometimes scrambled to fix problems - often after hackers or academic researchers revealed them publicly - but few companies were willing to undertake the costly overhauls necessary to make their systems significantly more secure against future attacks. Their profits depended on other factors, such as providing consumers new features, not warding off hackers.</p><p>\"In the real world, people only invest money to solve real problems, as opposed to hypothetical ones,\" said Dan S. Wallach, a Rice University computer science professor who has been studying online threats since the 1990s. \"The thing that you're selling is not security. The thing that you're selling is something else.\"</p><p>The result was a culture within the tech industry often derided as \"patch and pray.\" In other words, keep building, keep selling and send out fixes as necessary. If a system failed - causing lost data, stolen credit card numbers or time-consuming computer crashes - the burden fell not on giant, rich tech companies but on their customers.</p><p>The members of L0pht say they often experienced this cavalier attitude in their day jobs, where some toiled as humble programmers or salesmen at computer stores. When they reported bugs to software makers, company officials often asked: Does anybody else know about this?</p><h>Geek heaven in Boston loft</h><p>The hackers met online, mostly on the bulletin boards that provided computer enthusiasts with freewheeling forums for trading tips, jokes and insights about how various systems worked - and in some cases could be made to do things their creators never intended. This is the essence of hacking. It is not inherently good or evil. It can be either, or in some cases a combination of both, depending on the motives of the hackers.</p><p>L0pht's members - the exact list shifted year to year but averaged seven or eight - shared a fascination with technology and a knack for testing its limits. They would decode the program running a piece of hardware or repeatedly flood a password field with too many characters, a hack known as a \"buffer overflow\" that often caused systems to fail, opening the door to further manipulation.</p><p>\"The difference between how it's supposed to work and how it really works is where the vulnerabilities happen,\" said Chris Wysopal, known as Weld Pond in his L0pht days.</p><p>The group's first clubhouse - and the inspiration for the name - was an actual loft above a carpentry shop in Boston's South End neighborhood, rented after the girlfriend of one of the hackers grew weary of all of the old computer gear littering their apartment (including several pieces resting semi-permanently in their bathroom).</p><p>Like the Internet itself, there seemed to be peril on the down-and-out streets all around L0pht's loft in the era before gentrification. But inside was geek heaven, with cast-off computers, a television, a couch, cold beer, a 1980s-vintage \"Battlezone\" arcade game and a curious array of second-hand mannequins wearing unusual adornments, including a skirt, a gas mask and the charred remnants of a police uniform that the hackers found. In a stroke of luck, the landlord paid the electrical bill each month, keeping an endless lifeline of electrons flowing to what amounted to a power-hungry computer lab.</p><p>\"It was totally scary to get there, but once you got there it was like, 'Ahhhhh,' \" recalled Joe Grand, a mischievous skateboarding enthusiast who was L0pht's youngest member. \"It really was a refuge in a lot of ways. It really shaped my life.\"</p><p>Much of the gear they used - and tried to bend to their wills - had been collected from dumpsters around the tech-heavy Boston area. L0pht's members refurbished some hardware to sell at flea markets to help pay the bills, but they kept the most useful pieces, including a giant VAX computer - a hunk of 1970s-vintage technology featuring two units, each the size of a washing machine - that they somehow hauled up steep stairs and into the loft.</p><p>They came to particularly disdain what they considered security-by-checklist, when companies declared a product safe merely because they had implemented a specified number of standard features, such as passwords and basic cryptography. \"We'd say, 'Give us one. We're going to try to break into it,' \" recalled Wysopal.</p><p>They almost always did, usually after toiling late into the night in a frenzy of discovery, flooding systems with inputs that programmers had not anticipated or in any way prepared for. Paul Nash, whose hacker name was Silicosis, once discovered that he could knock computers using Microsoft's Windows operating systems offline by sending a single command - a trick he happily showed off to visitors.</p><p>When members of L0pht weren't trying to find their own bugs, they were supporting others in doing so, including through regular gatherings at a Boston bar in which anyone who revealed a new computer vulnerability got a free beer. L0pht also spread the word about security discoveries though the Hacker News Network, a popular online newsletter run by Space Rogue, a born tinkerer who had rigged up makeshift flashlights so he could read in bed at night as a kid. (He still routinely uses his hacker name today).</p><p>Hacker News Network grew popular enough that it drew interest from advertisers. The group didn't want to sully its main Web site, L0pht.com, but was happy to collect revenue from Hacker News Network. One of the earliest ads touted the availability, for a fee, of Russian brides.</p><h>Exposing bugs for all to see</h><p>L0pht partially embraced the bad-boy image of hackers, calling themselves \"gray hats,\" a middle ground between the avowedly virtuous \"white hat\" hackers and the openly outlaw \"black hats.\" The group took particular relish in trying to shame big companies, such as Microsoft, for selling products with security flaws to unsuspecting customers.</p><p>When L0pht discovered a way to crack the cryptography protecting user passwords for the Windows operating system, Mudge publicly chastised Microsoft for what he called \"kindergarten crypto\" and, along with Wysopal, created an easy-to-use software tool to help anyone defeat it. </p><p>L0pht member Dildog developed a program with another hacker group, called Cult of the Dead Cow, to remotely control office networks running Microsoft software. The name, a spoof on the company's popular \"BackOffice Server 2000\" program, was \"Back Orifice 2000\"; the promotional materials featured an equally crude logo.</p><p>But the reality of L0pht was more conventional than the public image. </p><p>Wysopal was a programmer for Lotus. Space Rogue and two others worked at CompUSA, a chain store. Several had jobs at BBN Technologies, a venerable tech company that years earlier helped build the most important forerunner to the Internet, a Pentagon-funded project called the ARPANET.</p><p>The men used their hacker names mainly because they feared getting fired if their employers learned of their nocturnal activities. (The other reason, nearly as important, was that they wanted to make it harder for companies facing embarrassing disclosures to sue them or call the cops - real threats, then and now, for anyone doing freelance security research.)</p><p>The day jobs also provided an insider view of the burgeoning tech industry, helping the hackers find bugs in widely used business or consumer products. Companies that seemed unresponsive to complaints through formal channels often found themselves in L0pht's cross hairs. The group maintained open lines to legions of other hackers - including those working inside big tech firms - and developed disdain for a business culture they say put profit above security.</p><p>\"It's get it up, get it running as fast as we can. Let's make some money,\" Nash said. \"There's this tremendous push to get code out the door, and we'll fix it later.\"</p><p>L0pht also came to doubt the eagerness of companies to fix flaws even after they had been discovered. In the early years of the group, reports to official company e-mail addresses - purportedly established to solicit security concerns - often seemed to just disappear into a black hole. A particular offender, L0pht members said, was <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:secure@microsoft.com\">secure@microsoft.com</email></p><p>They eventually discovered a reliable way to get companies' attention: Security alerts posted on L0pht.com drew notice from the world's technology journalists and eventually the companies themselves.</p><p>The downside was that plenty of \"black hat\" hackers also monitored L0pht's alerts, giving them time to take advantage of bugs before companies could possibly fix them. There's no way to know how many intrusions this aided, but the members of L0pht were unapologetic.</p><p>\"We always thought that if we knew about it, other people probably know about it and are exploiting it,\" said Grand, formerly known as Kingpin.</p><h>Bill Gates rides 'Tidal Wave'</h><p>The 1993 arrival of the first widely popular Web browser, Mosaic, made the Internet an unstoppable cultural and commercial force. Suddenly it wasn't an exotic, far-off wonderland for the technically adept. Anybody could \"surf the Web.\"</p><p>Over the next several years, sophisticated new programming languages such as Flash and Java dramatically expanded browsers'\u2002capabilities. Web sites began streaming video. Classic games such as \"Frogger,\" \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Tetris\" could be played, free of charge, on any computer that could get online.</p><p>For most users, these new features seemed almost magical. They appeared automatically, perhaps requiring just a click or two of a mouse. Soon, most computers in the world had Flash and similar programming languages on their hard drives.</p><p>Surging consumer interest was not lost on Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who penned a confidential memo to his top executives in May 1995 titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave.\" The 5,500-word document demanded in sweeping, urgent terms that the company compete forcefully in the explosive new online marketplace.</p><p>\"The next few years are going to be very exciting as we tackle these challenges and opportunities,\" Gates wrote. \"The Internet is a tidal wave. It changes the rules. It is an incredible opportunity as well as incredible challenge. I am looking forward to your input on how we can improve our strategy to continue our track record of incredible success.\"</p><p>Gates did warn about the importance of security in the memo, saying \"Our plans for security need to be strengthened.\" But he also said, \"I want every product plan to try and go overboard on Internet features.\"</p><p>This priority, many critics would later say, was the most important one to Microsoft, planting the seeds of what security experts called \"featuritis\" - a common malady in which new features are added more quickly than they can be made secure.</p><p>This rush to innovate, to make every Microsoft product essentially an Internet product, was felt deeply throughout the company, said Billy Brackenridge, a Microsoft program manager during the 1990s. The ability to deliver new features for the company's marquee operating systems and software determined who got stock options - a key motivator for a company whose stock split seven times that decade amid a total gain of more than 9,000 percent.</p><p>\"There may have been one or two guys who really cared [about security]. For the most part, it was, 'Get it out the door,' \" Brackenridge recalled. \"If we missed a date, that was real money. . . . If your feature didn't get in, you didn't get stock.\"</p><p>Microsoft's competitive juices fueled a furious push to develop a browser to challenge the primacy of Netscape Navigator, which was produced largely by the same team of programmers who had created Mosaic. By the mid-1990s, Navigator had more than 70 percent market share, Gates warned in his memo.</p><p>The Microsoft answer was to create Internet Explorer and to integrate the browser extensively with its dominant Windows operating system. This effort was central to the Justice Department's antitrust charges against Microsoft, which were settled in 2001.</p><p>But it had other effects more immediately noticeable to L0pht and other hackers.</p><p>As Microsoft worked to infuse Internet-related features into its products, the company created portals for hackers to discover and exploit. A particularly notorious one was a programming language called ActiveX, which like Flash and Java reached deeply into the brains of a user's computer.</p><p>\"Once you go to a Web site and download some code and it executes itself . . . you have a whole new type of problem,\" said Giovanni Vigna, a computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara and co-founder of Lastline, a security company. </p><p>\"Now I have running code on your machine, and I can do all sorts of interesting things.\"</p><h>700 users, 1 bad password </h><p>At a hacker conference in August 1997, Mudge - whose real name is Peiter Zatko and who infused a zeal for showmanship into L0pht - visibly delighted in tweaking Microsoft as he described cracking the password security on Windows, at the time the standard operating system for business and government computers worldwide.</p><p>\"I don't want to be working on Microsoft products right now,\" Mudge declared. \"The problem is: They're everywhere! You cannot get away from them!\"</p><p>He singled out a particularly egregious security flaw - splitting a strong 14-character password field into two much weaker seven-character passwords for storage. The longer a password, the more combinations a hacker must try to break it. But Microsoft, Mudge reported, had undermined that principle by creating, in essence, two shorter and easily cracked passwords instead of one strong one.</p><p>Worse still, if the user had picked a password that was seven characters or fewer, the system stored a telltale string of characters to represent the unused portion of the password field. When hackers found this string, they knew that they already had the password halfway cracked. Mudge happily recited the odd combination of letters and numbers at the conference, with dozens of hackers looking on.</p><p>\"I'm going to get that tattooed across my forehead and walk through the halls of Microsoft!\" he said to laughter from the crowd.</p><p>He also announced that L0pht had discovered that a single password - \"CHANGEME\" - was being used by 700 users of one network the group studied.</p><p>Such antics drew fans within the hacker world, a hint of wider celebrity and the first whiff of money. L0pht sold T-shirts bearing its logo at conferences and also began selling its tool for cracking Windows passwords - called L0pht Crack - for $50 to system administrators eager to test the strength of passwords on the networks they managed.</p><p>When the members of L0pht realized how much security consultants were charging for such services, they raised the price to $150, then $500. (One of the buyers was the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency that chronicled failings of federal IT systems).</p><p>For all L0pht's drive to break systems online, members had long run their club with a certain formality. They had regular meetings, set collective priorities and handled financial matters carefully. </p><p>Each hacker had his own desk and paid $100 a month toward rent; those who couldn't afford that would share desks and pay half as much.</p><p>But the money rushing into computer security got their attention. They got a first taste of it when the online ads along with sales of T-shirts and L0pht Crack meant that members no longer had to reach as deeply into their own pockets for rent or other costs. They also noticed how a rising generation of security consultants - including some doing \"stress testing\" using tactics much like L0pht's - were getting big paydays.</p><p>By the time L0pht appeared before the Senate in 1998, the idea of starting a real company - and earning enough profit to quit their day jobs - was starting to form within the group.</p><p>\"You know,\" Space Rogue remembered thinking, \"maybe we should get a piece of that.\"</p><p>This was the beginning of the end for L0pht.</p><h>A close call at the NSA</h><p>They had an uproariously fun trip to Washington for the Senate testimony, renting a dark green, 15-passenger van and installing an array of antennas on the roof to see what signals they could pick up along the way.</p><p>This seemed like harmless hacker fun until they made a stop at the National Cryptologic Museum, on the grounds of the National Security Agency in suburban Maryland. Zatko had visited the NSA several times before, he said, part of gradual move into federal government work. \"I wanted them to have sensitivities, to know that hackers aren't the bad guys,\" he explained later.</p><p>But on this trip, Zatko accidentally directed the L0pht van, its roof bristling with interception equipment, to the entrance of a secure area of the NSA campus. Driving the van was L0pht member Stefan von Neumann, who appeared confused when he pulled up to a checkpoint manned by an armed military guard. When the guard saluted von Neumann, whose real name is Stefan Wuensch, he asked his fellow hackers, \"What should I do?\"</p><p>In unison, they shouted, \"Salute back!\"</p><p>But once on the grounds of the famously secret spy agency, the members of L0pht quickly grew uneasy and urged von Neumann to exit the grounds as quickly as possible. He soon did, getting the van to the museum, then onward to Washington without further incident.</p><p>The hackers testified the following day before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, whose staffers told L0pht that only members of federal witness protection programs had previously been allowed to testify using aliases. The hackers then took a tour of the White House, guided by National Security Council counterterrorism official Richard A. Clarke.</p><p>A cover story in Internet Week magazine, featuring Wysopal and Zatko (a.k.a. Weld Pond and Mudge), finally blew their cover at work, but they weren't fired as they had feared. The New York Times Magazine also featured L0pht in a story, as did PBS and MTV. The hackers' boasts about being able to take down the Internet in 30 minutes - by exploiting flaws in a key Internet routing protocol called BGP - prompted mentions from Conan O'Brien and Rush Limbaugh, who called them \"long-haired nerd computer hackers.\"</p><p>Even the makers of Trivial Pursuit took notice. Question: What did a group of geeks called L0pht tell the U.S. Senate they could cripple in 30 minutes?</p><p>Answer: The Internet.</p><p>By the time that edition of the game hit the stores in 2000, L0pht was no longer L0pht. The hackers had joined @Stake, a security company built largely on L0pht's fame and $10 million in venture-capital funding. They quit their day jobs to finally pursue their nocturnal hobby full time.</p><p>But they also acquired an unwelcome new set of rules and responsibilities - especially to clients who were happy to pay for their expertise but didn't fancy getting publicly roasted whenever the hackers discovered problems.</p><p>\"The community we came from thought we were selling out to the Man, which of course we were,\" Wysopal recalled.</p><p>Among the biggest companies to hire @Stake - and demand nondisclosure agreements about what they found - was L0pht's longtime nemesis: Microsoft.</p><h>Dropping the ax</h><p>As business realities set in, Space Rogue was the first casualty. He had run the operations side of L0pht and also Hacker News Network. But the venture capitalists had their own operational guys, and they weren't keen on publicly affiliating themselves with the word \"hacker.\"</p><p>So the online newsletter became a sanitized corporate Web site called \"Security News Network,\" and Space Rogue got a job in @Stake's marketing department - far from the center of gravity where Mudge, Kingpin, Weld Pond and the others worked. Space Rogue was fired soon after.</p><p>The company confiscated his laptop computer and unceremoniously escorted him out the door for reasons he says he still doesn't understand. By the time Space Rogue got home, his L0pht.com accounts had been shut down. He had no idea - and still doesn't - whether any of his fellow hackers spoke up for him or fought the firing.</p><p>\"That was a bad part of my life. . . . I lost six of my best friends,\" Space Rogue recalled. \"It was really devastating to me. It took me a long time to recover from that.\"</p><p>The dot-com bubble, which had pushed tech companies' valuations into the stratosphere, burst about the same time, sweeping away weak companies like Pets.com and squeezing revenue throughout the industry. The chief executive of @Stake, who was brought in to provide something like parental supervision to L0pht, ordered Wysopal to single out a member of the group for a layoff in order to balance out cuts elsewhere in the company.</p><p>Wysopal said he reluctantly dropped the ax on Brian Oblivion, one of L0pht's charter members, whose real name is Brian Hassick. The firing came the day before Hassick's son was to be baptized; he and Wysopal did not speak again for months.</p><p>As the bonds at the heart of L0pht deteriorated, Zatko mysteriously disappeared. Though not a founding member of the group, he had been its most public face during the rise to fame. </p><p>If L0pht was something akin to the Beatles of the hacker world - combining serious chops with an instinct for self-promotion - Zatko was the mercurial, boundary-busting John Lennon to Wysopal's even-keeled Paul McCartney.</p><p>But as @Stake struggled, Zatko developed severe anxiety, made worse by a bad reaction to medicine that was supposed to ease his symptoms, he said. Zatko ended up in a psychiatric ward for several days. None of the members of L0pht came to visit, a source of enduring frustration to him. (They say they didn't know what was happening, only that he was missing from work.)</p><p>\"The L0pht was my only family,\" Zatko recalled. \"It killed me. . . . It was absolutely atrocious.\"</p><p>Though Zatko gradually recovered, the decline of @Stake continued. Space Rogue threatened a lawsuit to reclaim lost wages and his remaining share of the initial venture-capital funding. (He eventually settled with enough to buy a car, cover his lawyer's fees and put a down payment on a condominium, he says.)</p><p>Perhaps an even lower point for @Stake came in September 2003, when the company fired its chief technology officer, the respected security guru Dan Geer, after he co-authored a study on how Microsoft's dominance of the software industry undermined security. Geer learned of his dismissal through a news release issued by @Stake, according to news reports at the time.</p><p>When Symantec, a larger security firm, bought the remains of @Stake in 2004, it was a mercy killing.</p><p>\"Everything we stood for had been nibbled away little by little by little until we were left with nothing,\" Grand said. \"We needed to be able to speak the truth about everybody. That didn't last very long. . . . Eventually we just got on our knees for everybody.\"</p><p>As L0pht was collapsing, security on the Internet took a turn for the worse. The waning days of the 20th century featured huge investments toward fixing the Y2K bug - based on the alarming possibility that programs designed to recognize years by only two digits, such as \"99,\" would suddenly crash when they saw \"00.\"</p><p>But the problems that would soon bedevil computing were not accidental, like the Y2K bug. The black hats were on the rise.</p><p>Among the first security disasters of the next decade, the ILOVEYOU worm arrived in May 2000 and apparently was the work of a pair of computer programmers from the Philippines. </p><p>The virus exploited a feature in Microsoft Outlook to send malicious code to each new victim's contact lists.</p><p>Soon, an estimated 10 percent of the world's computers were infected, snarling networks for the Pentagon, the British Parliament and many private companies. Estimates of damage and cleanup costs topped $20 billion. Many other worms - with names such as Pikachu, Anna Kournikova and Nimda - also exploited flaws in Microsoft products.</p><p>On Dec. 8, 2000, one day after the anniversary of the surprise Japanese attack on U.S. Navy forces in 1941, Clarke - the National Security Council official who had once given L0pht a tour of the White House - appeared at a conference organized by Microsoft. </p><p>He warned that if the government didn't improve computer security, the nation might suffer a \"digital Pearl Harbor.\"</p><h>'Hackers are like water'</h><p>L0pht's legacy is a mixed one. The group was among the pioneers of a system called \"responsible disclosure,\" still widely used today, in which researchers who find bugs give companies a set amount of time to make fixes before security flaws are announced to the world. Some companies now go a step further, offering cash rewards called \"bug bounties\" to encourage hackers to search for problems - and ideally find them ahead of criminals and spies.</p><p>Microsoft eventually became more serious about security. It didn't have much choice: Major customers told Gates to either do better or lose their business. In a memo in January 2002 - something of a bookend to the one from 1995 - Gates declared that a new security initiative was \"the highest priority for all the work we are doing.\"</p><p>The move initially drew some skepticism. \"When I told friends I was going to Microsoft to do security . . . most of them laughed at me because I used 'Microsoft' and 'security' in the same sentence,\" said Scott Charney, a former Justice Department official hired in 2002. He is now corporate vice president for Trustworthy Computing at Microsoft.</p><p>Microsoft pulled thousands of engineers off of product development to overhaul the company's systems for designing and building software. Gates sent one group of officials to a retreat at a historic wooden home more commonly used for weddings, in nearby Bellevue, Wash., about a 15-minute drive from Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond. Charney said, \"Basically some people were sent there and told, don't come back until you have an answer.\"</p><p>But the Internet did not suddenly become secure. The company's newfound focus on security took years to bear fruit, most notably with the arrival of Windows Vista in 2006 and Office 2010 a few years later. Because of a need for \"backward compatibility\" - meaning older and newer versions of Microsoft products work easily together - old flaws lingered in the online world for many years after they were fixed in newly released software.</p><p>The federal government in the past year finally has replaced hundreds of thousands of computers running Windows XP - an operating system first released in 2001, months before Gates's call to arms on product security - after the company withdrew free support after nearly 13 years.</p><p>But as Microsoft's products became more secure, hackers began feasting on alternative targets that did not get similar overhauls.</p><p>\"Hackers are like water,\" said Vigna, the computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"They always go for the path of least resistance. . . . If you put a plug in place, they will find another crack.\"</p><p>At the root is an issue raised by L0pht in its Senate testimony: The business incentives within the tech industry favor growth over security. And once companies get big enough that security is a major concern - as eventually happened to Microsoft - it's extremely difficult to retrofit rigorous protections into systems built without them.</p><p>Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who chaired the Senate panel in 1998 and left Congress in 2003, said in a recent interview that Internet security is the kind of problem the government has trouble fixing. \"Number one, it's very difficult, and number two, there's no immediate political payoff for anyone.\"</p><h>The rise of the black hats</h><p>Some industry critics favor strict government standards and legal liability for failures, as long have existed for many critical offline systems such as cars, elevators and airplanes. Others would create an independent group, a tech industry equivalent to Underwriters Laboratories, which certifies the safety of electronic devices worldwide. Or perhaps insurance companies, which ultimately foot the bill for many cybersecurity incidents, may some day demand better safety practices from their clients, as insurers long have done for homes and cars.</p><p>But others have argued that demands for greater security could damp innovation and make tech products harder to use. Given the industry's increasingly central role in the national economy - and the massive expansion in tech lobbying power in Washington in recent years - tough new laws or regulations remain difficult to imagine.</p><p>\"The only way to get in front of the security problem is to build better software,\" said Gary McGraw, chief technology official for Cigital, a Northern Virginia-based firm that has worked on software security since the 1990s. \"Until we start building security in, we'll always play catch-up.\"</p><p>L0pht itself has rebounded a bit, releasing an updated version of L0pht Crack in 2009. The main Web site is still running, if a bit dated-looking. The Hacker News Network regained its name and its edge. </p><p>Wysopal and fellow L0pht hacker Dildog founded a security company, Veracode, in 2006. Zatko, after recovering from severe anxiety, rejoined BBN Technologies. He later spent three years directing cybersecurity research at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon agency that created the forerunner to the Internet decades ago, before becoming deputy director for a research team at Google.</p><p>Most of the others still work on computer security issues. They had a reunion of sorts in the summer of 2014 at Space Rogue's wedding in Philadelphia. The emotional wounds from the @Stake debacle have scarred over if not disappeared.</p><p>As for the security issues they once highlighted for the U.S. government and the world, the news is far worse. Hackers - the black-hat kind - have consistently outrun efforts to impose security.</p><p>Wysopal offered this grim precedent: Cities were once vulnerable to disastrous fires, which raged through dense clusters of mostly wooden buildings. It took a giant fire in Chicago to spur government officials into serious reforms, including limits on new wooden structures, a more robust water supply for suppressing blazes and an overhaul to the city's fire department.</p><p>\"The market didn't solve the problem of cities burning down,\" Wysopal said, predicting that Internet security may require a historic disaster to force change. \"It seems to me that the market isn't really going to solve this one on its own.\"</p><p>But here's a frightening fact: The push to create tough new fire-safety standards did not start after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, which killed hundreds of people and left 100,000 homeless. It took a second fire, nearly three years later in 1874, to get officials in Chicago to finally make real changes.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p><p> Follow The Post's tech blog, The Switch, where technology and policy connect. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-3797ebc8-0e0a-11e5-a0dc-2b6f404ff5cf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G8S-97Y1-DXXY-3015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Met 2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 23, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

'So they cater to the Trump administration all the time. I think Mark Zuckerberg's statement was a disgrace.' Pelosi was responding to a Wednesday interview in which Zuckerberg said he disagreed with a decision by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to 'fact check' one of President Donald Trump's tweets on vote-by-mail balloting. 'We have a different policy than Twitter on this. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' Zuckerberg said. 'I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be \u2014 especially these platform companies \u2014 shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' Pelosi subsequently took aim at Dorsey, lamenting Twitter's failure to apply the same policy to other Trump tweets and speculating about 'honor among thieves.' 'Twitter, they're not taking off any accusations the president is making about Joe Scarborough,' Pelosi said. 'They do a token thing and think it's okay. Again, I don't know if there's honor among thieves, but that's the \u2014 they only have a business model to make money, not to convey facts. That's what they're about. Again, I see it as a distraction from what is the challenge at hand, which is to save lives. And every day the president comes up with another stunt, and every day airwaves are full of that stunt without holding him fully accountable for the lives that are lost because we don't have, under his leadership, appropriate testing.' Watch above via MSNBC. Have a tip we should know?

That's not to say that a Disney-Fox deal is similar in structure to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner transaction, but there's a certain hubris now in envisioning any major transaction as a sure thing.</p><p/><p>CNBC reported on Tuesday that Disney and Fox are in talks for what \"very well may result\" in a deal in which Disney buys the film and TV studio, the Fox cable networks, the regional sports networks, the Fox share in Hulu and their ownership of Sky, the European telecom.</p><p/><p>What would remain for <url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/disney-fox-adds-uncertainty-fox-sky-takeover-bid-1202631195/\">21st Century Fox</url> would be the Fox network, the Fox TV stations, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>and some of the sports networks. Rupert Murdoch's apparent desire to keep those assets may be a good thing from a regulatory standpoint, as it takes out of the equation some serious regulatory concerns. FCC rules, for instance, prohibit a merger between any of the four major broadcast networks, meaning there would be a question of whether ABC or Fox is divested.</p><p/><p>It's even possible that the transaction, as has been reported, would avoid FCC scrutiny altogether, just as AT&amp;T and Time Warner managed to do in their transaction.</p><p/><p>Yet as they found out, the Justice Department did not buy the idea that just because it is a vertical merger, in which the transaction does not directly eliminate competition, doesn't mean that there still aren't antitrust issues. The DOJ, in its complaint, argues that AT&amp;T could withhold or drive up prices for Time Warner's cable channels from rival distributors, with costs ultimately borne by consumers.</p><p/><p>Disney certainly owns a TV network, plenty of prized content and the prized ESPN cable network, but unlike AT&amp;T, it doesn't have a multichannel distribution platform or its own mobile service. A Disney-Fox combination would put two of Hollywood's legendary major production studios, each nearing a century in existence, under the same roof. That in and of itself would signal that the traditional movie and TV business is consolidating and changing in dramatic ways.</p><p/><p>\"This DOJ has shown that it is skeptical even of a vertical merger,\" said Gigi Sohn, distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology and Public Policy and former counselor to the chairman at the FCC. \"I can only imagine that they will push back on a horizontal one as well.\"</p><p/><p>The argument for such a horizontal merger would be that it is necessary in the face of competition from the massive influx of money coming from Silicon Valley, namely in the form of Apple, Google, Facebook and Netflix, and the drift away from the cable bundle to over-the-top programming services. Disney is developing one of its own.</p><p/><p>In a recent research report, Michael Nathanson outlined this changed landscape, but wrote that \"the key x-factor with all M&amp;A is awaiting the outcome of the [AT&amp;T-Time Warner] merger and the DOJ. Nonetheless, some deals could be announced so that if AT&amp;T ends up winning its case, the other deals would be ready to close shortly after the ruling.\"</p><p/><p>Here are other areas of potential challenge.</p><p/><p>DOJ: A Disney-Fox combination would certainly raise scrutiny over the power that the combined company would have over content, and past big media mergers have focused on issues like the impact on cable advertising and sports rights. BTIG Research's Richard Greenfield, who has been a Disney critic, asked in a note on Tuesday, \"Would regulators even allow Disney to increase the scale of their dominate film studio? We presume theater owners and an array of film industry guilds would staunchly oppose more consolidation (domestically Fox and Disney represented 40% of box office in 2016 and over 30% so far in 2017).\"</p><p/><p>When reports surfaced in 2014 that Fox made an offer to buy Time Warner, some analysts said that what would work in its favor with regulators is that even after two fabled studios combined, there still would be three or four significant studio rivals left in the marketplace. The case could be made that since then, the influx of money from Silicon Valley has added new competitive players.</p><p/><p>\"I think this would not likely raise significant antitrust concerns in the current environment,\" Mark Ostrau, chair of the antitrust and trade regulation group at Fenwick &amp; West in Mountain View, Calif., said in an email. \"The Administration, while continuing to be concerned with deals involving content providers and content gateways (e.g., cable or satellite operators), appears to be more sanguine about combinations involving different content assets, likely in part due to the expansion of sources of content - including the rise of online or OTT suppliers like Netflix and Amazon creating their own content.\"</p><p/><p>Yet there is also another point of view, especially from those who have been critical of the Justice Department's case against AT&amp;T-Time Warner.</p><p/><p>Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy, said via email that \"if the\u00a0sale includes significant assets considered 'must have' for consumers, than Disney may face the same condemnation that the Antitrust Division has now leveled at the AT&amp;T/Time Warner deal.\" He says that the DOJ case \"makes no economic sense,\" but says that \"if the Department is going to pursue this radical new theory of antitrust, it will have to be consistent.\"</p><p/><p>He adds, \"Traditional content producers including Disney, Fox, and Time Warner have lost substantial competitive leverage in the wake of disruptive new entertainment products and services from the likes of Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix, SnapChat, Twitch and Vevo. Consumers now have new ways to enjoy even more content on new devices, new networks, and in new formats.</p><p/><p>\"These deals are the direct response.\u00a0 In challenging them on vague 'big is bad' grounds, the DOJ will cause significant harm to consumers, not save them from it.\"</p><p/><p>Politics: A merger this size would likely face lawmakers on Capitol Hill, via a hearing before the House and/or Senate Judiciary's antitrust subcommittees, where CEOs traditionally face lawmakers ready to ask any type of question. This is mainly about political and public reaction, as mergers do not require congressional approval, but there has been an increasing focus among Democrats and even Republicans on the issue of antitrust.</p><p/><p>Last summer, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced a Democratic agenda that called for tougher antitrust enforcement, including in the media sector, although some in Hollywood groused that there was too little focus on the monopoly that big tech companies have in the marketplace.</p><p/><p>More specifically, though, there is the Murdoch factor. He reportedly talks to Trump on a fairly regular basis, and there will be plenty of interest in how the White House would view this transaction, given the president's disdain for the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger. In the same way that Capitol Hill critics have raised questions of whether Trump influenced the AT&amp;T-Time Warner review as a way to retaliate against CNN, so too is there likely to be focus on any sign of input on a Fox-Disney deal and whether there has been any favor shown to Murdoch.</p><p/><p/><p>Related stories</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/disney-fox-adds-uncertainty-fox-sky-takeover-bid-1202631195/\">Disney-21st Century Fox Negotiations Add Uncertainty to Fox's Sky Takeover Bid</url></p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/disney-21st-century-fox-murdoch-fx-1202631508/\">Disney-Fox Deal: Who Would Stay, Who Would Go if Murdochs Decide to Sell</url></p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/disney-hulu-fox-studios-netflix-killer-1202631006/\">Would Disney, With Control of Hulu and Fox Studios, Have Formula for a Netflix Killer?</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1202631193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R41-RV91-JC3V-61PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 6, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

A tech-focused civil liberties group on Tuesday, June 2, 2020, sued to block President Donald Trump's executive order that seeks to regulate social media, saying it violates the First Amendment and chills speech. Trump's order, signed in late May, could allow more lawsuits against internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for what their users post, tweet and stream. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department proposed Wednesday that Congress roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in President Donald Trump's drive against the social media giants. </p><p>The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.  'When it comes to issues of public safety, the government is the one who must act on behalf of society at large. Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.  The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them 'to be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They 'are targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"  In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his posts. He said the fact checks were 'editorial decisions' by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election. But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has used that platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech titans in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.Conservative politicians argue that the social media platforms have abused their legal protection and should lose their immunity, or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. In addition to alleged censorship of political views, accusations commonly leveled by conservatives include anti-religious bias and a tilt against abortion foes.  GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who's one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech, proposed a bill Wednesday that would withhold immunity from the companies unless they update their terms of service to promise 'to operate in good faith\" by not selectively censoring political speech. They would be fined $5,000 for violating the promise.  Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.  Reducing the immunity protections 'will make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. 'The threat of litigation for every content moderation decision would hamper (our) member companies' ability to set and enforce community guidelines and quickly respond to new challenges in order to make their services safe, enjoyable places for Americans.' The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as 'platforms,' rather than 'publishers,' which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted. One of the administration's requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity. The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed 'at incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230's immunity for defamation.'  The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don't 'respect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,' according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press. 'Further, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),' the document says. The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. 7 Energy Stocks to Buy On This Historical Dip[1]It may seem hard to believe, but the current chaos in the energy sector, and oil stocks, in particular, will pass. The novel coronavirus that has birthed a global pandemic is being compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918. Of course, when you have once in a century event, it's difficult to look back in history and make an apples-to-apples comparison to our current situation. This isn't to minimize our current situation. It's simply to say that the market is forward-looking, but it's also emotional. And it also hates uncertainty. In a typical economic downturn, demand decreases, and investors are advised to 'buy the dip.' But in the current environment, demand has been destroyed. Millions of Americans are being asked, and in some cases ordered, to stay home. And this simply means that oil demand is down. And investors are looking at prices that are, in some cases, at all-time lows. The trading app Robinhood is frequented by millennial investors. And according to the latest information, many investors are trying to buy the dip on old guard oil stocks. That may be a mistake. But the energy sector is about more than just oil stocks. There are several companies that are holding their own in the current environment. And that means when the economy opens up, these companies will be well-positioned for further growth. Currently, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding energy stocks make them a poor choice for growth investors. However, many of these companies in this presentation offer a secure dividend that, along with the potential for capital appreciation, can make them a solid play for income investors.

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \"to be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \"are targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his posts. He said the fact checks were \"editorial decisions\" by Twitter amounting to political activism - and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has used that platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech titans in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.</p><p>Conservative politicians argue that the social media platforms have abused their legal protection and should lose their immunity, or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. In addition to alleged censorship of political views, accusations commonly leveled by conservatives include anti-religious bias and a tilt against abortion foes.</p><p>GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who's one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech, proposed a bill Wednesday that would withhold immunity from the companies unless they update their terms of service to promise \"to operate in good faith\" by not selectively censoring political speech. They would be fined $5,000 for violating the promise.</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>Reducing the immunity protections \"will make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. \"The threat of litigation for every content moderation decision would hamper (our) member companies' ability to set and enforce community guidelines and quickly respond to new challenges in order to make their services safe, enjoyable places for Americans.\"</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \"platforms,\" rather than \"publishers,\" which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration's requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \"at incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230's immunity for defamation.\"</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don't \"respect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\" according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\"Further, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\" the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5eeab55985319image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5ee80b2a0c138image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTCUR-b8925dbdf91e5534ac2f40f9931c7797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTCUR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6058-PBM1-JCB8-W4G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Post and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Post &amp;

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \u201cto be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \u201care targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his posts. He said the fact checks were \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has used that platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech titans in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.</p><p>Conservative politicians argue that the social media platforms have abused their legal protection and should lose their immunity, or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. In addition to alleged censorship of political views, accusations commonly leveled by conservatives include anti-religious bias and a tilt against abortion foes.</p><p>GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who's one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech, proposed a bill Wednesday that would withhold immunity from the companies unless they update their terms of service to promise \u201cto operate in good faith\" by not selectively censoring political speech. They would be fined $5,000 for violating the promise.</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>Reducing the immunity protections \u201cwill make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. \u201cThe threat of litigation for every content moderation decision would hamper (our) member companies\u2019 ability to set and enforce community guidelines and quickly respond to new challenges in order to make their services safe, enjoyable places for Americans.\u201d</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \u201cplatforms,\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers,\u201d which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration\u2019s requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \u201cat incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230\u2019s immunity for defamation.\u201d</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don\u2019t \u201crespect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\u201d according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cFurther, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\u201d the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-806509152aedc7a6abd33f3ac6ff6d0c320200617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-V551-JC5B-G43T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \u201cto be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \u201care targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his posts. He said the fact checks were \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has used that platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech titans in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.</p><p>Conservative politicians argue that the social media platforms have abused their legal protection and should lose their immunity, or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. In addition to alleged censorship of political views, accusations commonly leveled by conservatives include anti-religious bias and a tilt against abortion foes.</p><p>GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who's one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech, proposed a bill Wednesday that would withhold immunity from the companies unless they update their terms of service to promise \u201cto operate in good faith\" by not selectively censoring political speech. They would be fined $5,000 for violating the promise.</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>Reducing the immunity protections \u201cwill make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. \u201cThe threat of litigation for every content moderation decision would hamper (our) member companies\u2019 ability to set and enforce community guidelines and quickly respond to new challenges in order to make their services safe, enjoyable places for Americans.\u201d</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \u201cplatforms,\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers,\u201d which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration\u2019s requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \u201cat incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230\u2019s immunity for defamation.\u201d</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don\u2019t \u201crespect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\u201d according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cFurther, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\u201d the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-806509152aedc7a6abd33f3ac6ff6d0c320200617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-V911-DYMD-627P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \u201cto be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \u201care targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his posts. He said the fact checks were \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has used that platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech titans in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.</p><p>Conservative politicians argue that the social media platforms have abused their legal protection and should lose their immunity, or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. In addition to alleged censorship of political views, accusations commonly leveled by conservatives include anti-religious bias and a tilt against abortion foes.</p><p>GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who's one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech, proposed a bill Wednesday that would withhold immunity from the companies unless they update their terms of service to promise \u201cto operate in good faith\" by not selectively censoring political speech. They would be fined $5,000 for violating the promise.</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>Reducing the immunity protections \u201cwill make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. \u201cThe threat of litigation for every content moderation decision would hamper (our) member companies\u2019 ability to set and enforce community guidelines and quickly respond to new challenges in order to make their services safe, enjoyable places for Americans.\u201d</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \u201cplatforms,\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers,\u201d which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration\u2019s requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \u201cat incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230\u2019s immunity for defamation.\u201d</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don\u2019t \u201crespect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\u201d according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cFurther, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\u201d the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-806509152aedc7a6abd33f3ac6ff6d0c320200617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-V5Y1-JC5B-G44C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \"to be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \"are targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his posts. He said the fact checks were \"editorial decisions\" by Twitter amounting to political activism - and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has used that platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech titans in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.</p><p>Conservative politicians argue that the social media platforms have abused their legal protection and should lose their immunity, or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. In addition to alleged censorship of political views, accusations commonly levelled by conservatives include anti-religious bias and a tilt against abortion foes.</p><p>GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who's one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech, proposed a bill Wednesday that would withhold immunity from the companies unless they update their terms of service to promise \"to operate in good faith\" by not selectively censoring political speech. They would be fined $5,000 for violating the promise.</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>Reducing the immunity protections \"will make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. \"The threat of litigation for every content moderation decision would hamper (our) member companies' ability to set and enforce community guidelines and quickly respond to new challenges in order to make their services safe, enjoyable places for Americans.\"</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \"platforms,\" rather than \"publishers,\" which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration's requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \"at incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230's immunity for defamation.\"</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don't \"respect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\" according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\"Further, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\" the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1847f8edd26ab351d841d2a20a9c0529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-64R1-JBVR-309N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>06:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

We upgraded the highest number of base stations in Telenor's history and we took important steps towards simplifying the corporate structure. In Thailand, we made an important transition from concession to licence model, securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. Furthermore, we continued to deliver on our efficiency agenda and financial ambitions. For the full year, this resulted in stable revenues, NOK 1.2 billion in cost reductions and a 3 per cent EBITDA growth. Telenor's fourth quarter results reflect that our performance in Scandinavia continues to be robust. In Norway, we are rolling out more fibre than ever, and we continue to see growth in the mobile postpaid segment. While Bangladesh and Pakistan saw a slow start to 2018, our businesses have now regained traction and are delivering solid growth. The last six months in Myanmar and Thailand have been challenging, and negatively impacted our fourth quarter results. Returning to growth in these markets will be a top priority for us this year. Halfway into the strategy plan we set out in 2017, we maintain our priorities and financial ambitions towards 2020.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

Four of the properties are sold on behalf of Telenor's Pension Fund.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>June 30: Telenor will appeal the decision from the EFTA Surveillance Authority<br/>(Fornebu 30 June 2020) The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) has investigated different aspects of Telenor's Norwegian mobile business in the period between 2008 to 2012 only. Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business.

The steps we have taken over the past two years have laid the foundation for continued value creation. The third quarter was an important milestone for us in Thailand, as the concession model came to an end. We are very pleased how the transition to the licence model has been executed, removing uncertainty and securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. We now have a solid platform to deliver superior data services to our customers and create value in the growing Thai market. In Norway, network quality is key to our customers and we are proud to have the world's fastest mobile network. Our mobile customer base grew for the first time in three years and in addition, we continued to expand our fibre network and connected close to 9,000 households during the quarter. In both Pakistan and Bangladesh revenue trends improved, while competition in Myanmar intensified following the entrance of a fourth mobile operator. We also successfully completed the sale of our operations in Central and Eastern Europe and will continue to drive our transformation forward with a clear focus on growth, efficiency and simplification. Our achievements so far this year confirm the organisation's strength and our ability to execute across the company,\" said Sigve Brekke, Chief Executive Officer of Telenor Group.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>October 22 2018: Telenor; Grameenphone third quarter 2018 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2018.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

Although organic subscription and traffic revenues declined by 1 percent, the EBITDA margin was 40 percent and we saw positive revenue development and effects from efficiency and modernisation programmes.

Preparations for 5G are ongoing through pilots and network upgrades. There is good traction on fibre rollout and copper infrastructure replacement, which will enable customers to connect faster and more reliably.<br/>In Thailand and Myanmar, we have seen improved revenue growth during the year. Investments made in Thailand are showing results, building a foundation for future growth. Subscription and traffic revenue growth in Bangladesh was 13 percent. During the quarter, 2.3 million new customers joined our networks globally.<br/>Our acquisition of a majority stake in Finland's DNA has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect completion of the deal in August. Following completion, we will launch a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares in the company. In Asia, we continue to work on the potential combination with Axiata, with the aim to finalise an agreement within the third quarter of 2019.<br/>Throughout the remaining half of the year, we will maintain operational momentum, continue to modernise our networks and create value for customers and shareholders,\" said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>July 15 2019: dtac - results for the second quarter 2019<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2019 results.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

Four of the properties are sold on behalf of Telenor's Pension Fund.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>June 30: Telenor will appeal the decision from the EFTA Surveillance Authority<br/>(Fornebu 30 June 2020) The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) has investigated different aspects of Telenor's Norwegian mobile business in the period between 2008 to 2012 only. Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business.

In Norway, network quality is key to our customers and we are proud to have the world's fastest mobile network. Our mobile customer base grew for the first time in three years and in addition, we continued to expand our fibre network and connected close to 9,000 households during the quarter. In both Pakistan and Bangladesh revenue trends improved, while competition in Myanmar intensified following the entrance of a fourth mobile operator. We also successfully completed the sale of our operations in Central and Eastern Europe and will continue to drive our transformation forward with a clear focus on growth, efficiency and simplification. Our achievements so far this year confirm the organisation's strength and our ability to execute across the company,\" said Sigve Brekke, Chief Executive Officer of Telenor Group.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>October 22 2018: Telenor; Grameenphone third quarter 2018 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2018.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

Although organic subscription and traffic revenues declined by 1 percent, the EBITDA margin was 40 percent and we saw positive revenue development and effects from efficiency and modernisation programmes. Our underlying financial performance remains stable.<br/>Across our markets, results show that the momentum set at the start of the year continues. In Norway, we see mobile ARPU growth of 2 percent. Preparations for 5G are ongoing through pilots and network upgrades. There is good traction on fibre rollout and copper infrastructure replacement, which will enable customers to connect faster and more reliably.<br/>In Thailand and Myanmar, we have seen improved revenue growth during the year. Investments made in Thailand are showing results, building a foundation for future growth. Subscription and traffic revenue growth in Bangladesh was 13 percent. During the quarter, 2.3 million new customers joined our networks globally.<br/>Our acquisition of a majority stake in Finland's DNA has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect completion of the deal in August. Following completion, we will launch a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares in the company. In Asia, we continue to work on the potential combination with Axiata, with the aim to finalise an agreement within the third quarter of 2019.<br/>Throughout the remaining half of the year, we will maintain operational momentum, continue to modernise our networks and create value for customers and shareholders,\" said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>July 15 2019: dtac - results for the second quarter 2019<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2019 results.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

We upgraded the highest number of base stations in Telenor's history and we took important steps towards simplifying the corporate structure. In Thailand, we made an important transition from concession to licence model, securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. Furthermore, we continued to deliver on our efficiency agenda and financial ambitions. For the full year, this resulted in stable revenues, NOK 1.2 billion in cost reductions and a 3 per cent EBITDA growth. Telenor's fourth quarter results reflect that our performance in Scandinavia continues to be robust. In Norway, we are rolling out more fibre than ever, and we continue to see growth in the mobile postpaid segment. While Bangladesh and Pakistan saw a slow start to 2018, our businesses have now regained traction and are delivering solid growth. The last six months in Myanmar and Thailand have been challenging, and negatively impacted our fourth quarter results. Returning to growth in these markets will be a top priority for us this year. Halfway into the strategy plan we set out in 2017, we maintain our priorities and financial ambitions towards 2020. Our efforts towards digital transformation continue and I am proud to have a dedicated team with the unwavering aim to continuously grow and improve our business, and to deliver great customer experiences,\" said Telenor Group Chief Executive Officer Sigve Brekke.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>January 28 2019: dtac - results for the fourth quarter 2018<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its fourth quarter 2018 results.

The settlement is subject to approval from dtac's Annual General Meeting in 2019.<br/>Over the 27 year concession period, dtac and CAT have been engaged in numerous litigation cases, mostly over differences in interpretation of the concession agreement.

Today's settlement will close all, except two, issues between dtac and CAT, and will also bar the parties from bringing new claims pertaining to the concession regime. The two issues not included in the overall settlement with CAT are two industry cases related to revenue sharing concerning excise tax and interconnection charges, both disclosed in the annual report 2017.<br/>Telenor has previously made provisions of around NOK 0.4 bn for some of the disputes which are now included in the settlement between dtac and CAT.

The first installment of THB 6.8 bn (around NOK 1.8 bn) will be made once the final approval from the Annual General Meeting is obtained.

We are very pleased how the transition to the licence model has been executed, removing uncertainty and securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. We now have a solid platform to deliver superior data services to our customers and create value in the growing Thai market. In Norway, network quality is key to our customers and we are proud to have the world's fastest mobile network. Our mobile customer base grew for the first time in three years and in addition, we continued to expand our fibre network and connected close to 9,000 households during the quarter. In both Pakistan and Bangladesh revenue trends improved, while competition in Myanmar intensified following the entrance of a fourth mobile operator.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

We upgraded the highest number of base stations in Telenor's history and we took important steps towards simplifying the corporate structure. In Thailand, we made an important transition from concession to licence model, securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. Furthermore, we continued to deliver on our efficiency agenda and financial ambitions. For the full year, this resulted in stable revenues, NOK 1.2 billion in cost reductions and a 3 per cent EBITDA growth. Telenor's fourth quarter results reflect that our performance in Scandinavia continues to be robust. In Norway, we are rolling out more fibre than ever, and we continue to see growth in the mobile postpaid segment. While Bangladesh and Pakistan saw a slow start to 2018, our businesses have now regained traction and are delivering solid growth. The last six months in Myanmar and Thailand have been challenging, and negatively impacted our fourth quarter results. Returning to growth in these markets will be a top priority for us this year. Halfway into the strategy plan we set out in 2017, we maintain our priorities and financial ambitions towards 2020. Our efforts towards digital transformation continue and I am proud to have a dedicated team with the unwavering aim to continuously grow and improve our business, and to deliver great customer experiences,\" said Telenor Group Chief Executive Officer Sigve Brekke.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>January 28 2019: dtac - results for the fourth quarter 2018<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its fourth quarter 2018 results.

The settlement is subject to approval from dtac's Annual General Meeting in 2019.<br/>Over the 27 year concession period, dtac and CAT have been engaged in numerous litigation cases, mostly over differences in interpretation of the concession agreement.

Today's settlement will close all, except two, issues between dtac and CAT, and will also bar the parties from bringing new claims pertaining to the concession regime. The two issues not included in the overall settlement with CAT are two industry cases related to revenue sharing concerning excise tax and interconnection charges, both disclosed in the annual report 2017.<br/>Telenor has previously made provisions of around NOK 0.4 bn for some of the disputes which are now included in the settlement between dtac and CAT.

The first installment of THB 6.8 bn (around NOK 1.8 bn) will be made once the final approval from the Annual General Meeting is obtained.

The third quarter was an important milestone for us in Thailand, as the concession model came to an end. We are very pleased how the transition to the licence model has been executed, removing uncertainty and securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. We now have a solid platform to deliver superior data services to our customers and create value in the growing Thai market. In Norway, network quality is key to our customers and we are proud to have the world's fastest mobile network. Our mobile customer base grew for the first time in three years and in addition, we continued to expand our fibre network and connected close to 9,000 households during the quarter. In both Pakistan and Bangladesh revenue trends improved, while competition in Myanmar intensified following the entrance of a fourth mobile operator.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

Although organic subscription and traffic revenues declined by 1 percent, the EBITDA margin was 40 percent and we saw positive revenue development and effects from efficiency and modernisation programmes. Our underlying financial performance remains stable.<br/>Across our markets, results show that the momentum set at the start of the year continues. In Norway, we see mobile ARPU growth of 2 percent. Preparations for 5G are ongoing through pilots and network upgrades. There is good traction on fibre rollout and copper infrastructure replacement, which will enable customers to connect faster and more reliably.<br/>In Thailand and Myanmar, we have seen improved revenue growth during the year. Investments made in Thailand are showing results, building a foundation for future growth. Subscription and traffic revenue growth in Bangladesh was 13 percent. During the quarter, 2.3 million new customers joined our networks globally.<br/>Our acquisition of a majority stake in Finland's DNA has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect completion of the deal in August. Following completion, we will launch a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares in the company. In Asia, we continue to work on the potential combination with Axiata, with the aim to finalise an agreement within the third quarter of 2019.<br/>Throughout the remaining half of the year, we will maintain operational momentum, continue to modernise our networks and create value for customers and shareholders,\" said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>May 23 2019: Telenor ASA - Issuance of bonds<br/>Telenor ASA has on 23 May 2019 issued the following bond tranches under the company's EMTN programme:<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>May 06 2019: General meetings in PHP and Finda approve sale of stakes in DNA to Telenor<br/>Reference is made to Telenor's the stock exchange announcement on 9 April 2019 regarding agreements with PHP Holding Oy and Finda Telecoms Oy to acquire their respective stakes (in total 54 %) in the Finnish telecom operator DNA.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

Telenor's fourth quarter results reflect that our performance in Scandinavia continues to be robust. In Norway, we are rolling out more fibre than ever, and we continue to see growth in the mobile postpaid segment. While Bangladesh and Pakistan saw a slow start to 2018, our businesses have now regained traction and are delivering solid growth. The last six months in Myanmar and Thailand have been challenging, and negatively impacted our fourth quarter results. Returning to growth in these markets will be a top priority for us this year.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>SECTION 13 Snapshot of 10 Norwegian

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia.

As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

It is anticipated that Telenor, based on equity value, will own 56.5% in MergeCo and Axiata will own 43.5%, both parties acknowledging that this is preliminary subject to adjustments and due diligence. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any transaction agreement between the parties. The parties aim to create a leading, well diversified Pan-Asian telco with operations in nine countries with a total population of close to one billion people. The MergeCo will have close to 300 million customers and become one of Asia's largest mobile infrastructure companies operating approximately 60,000 towers across Asia. The MergeCo will have its operational headquarters in Kuala Lumpur with the majority of functions and is planned to be listed at an international stock exchange as well as on Bursa Malaysia. In Malaysia, the intention is to merge Celcom and Digi, with MergeCo as the majority owner in the combined business. By uniting two strong organisations with complementary footprints and a merger of equals spirit, there will be attractive opportunities to capture substantial synergies preliminary estimated at around USD 5 billion (around NOK 43 billion) in total; support future investments and create shareholder value. The MergeCo will take an active role in accelerating technology transformation and digitalisation in Malaysia and across Asia, and plans to establish the Malaysian Research and Innovation Centre for state-of-the-art technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. \"Today we announce that Telenor and Axiata are in discussions on joining forces in Asia, one of the most dynamic and innovative regions in the world.</p><p>April 03 2019: Telenor: Grameenphone has received demand notice from BTRC<br/>Telenor's subsidiary in Bangladesh, Grameenphone, received a demand notice from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) yesterday amounting to BDT 125.8 billion (around NOK 12.9 billion).

We upgraded the highest number of base stations in Telenor's history and we took important steps towards simplifying the corporate structure. In Thailand, we made an important transition from concession to licence model, securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. Furthermore, we continued to deliver on our efficiency agenda and financial ambitions. For the full year, this resulted in stable revenues, NOK 1.2 billion in cost reductions and a 3 per cent EBITDA growth. Telenor's fourth quarter results reflect that our performance in Scandinavia continues to be robust. In Norway, we are rolling out more fibre than ever, and we continue to see growth in the mobile postpaid segment. While Bangladesh and Pakistan saw a slow start to 2018, our businesses have now regained traction and are delivering solid growth. The last six months in Myanmar and Thailand have been challenging, and negatively impacted our fourth quarter results. Returning to growth in these markets will be a top priority for us this year. Halfway into the strategy plan we set out in 2017, we maintain our priorities and financial ambitions towards 2020. Our efforts towards digital transformation continue and I am proud to have a dedicated team with the unwavering aim to continuously grow and improve our business, and to deliver great customer experiences,\" said Telenor Group Chief Executive Officer Sigve Brekke.<br/>Source: Oslo Bors</p><p>January 28 2019: dtac - results for the fourth quarter 2018<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its fourth quarter 2018 results.

According to this agreement, dtac will pay a total amount of THB 9.51 bn (around NOK 2.5 bn) to CAT. The settlement is subject to approval from dtac's Annual General Meeting in 2019.<br/>Over the 27 year concession period, dtac and CAT have been engaged in numerous litigation cases, mostly over differences in interpretation of the concession agreement. The most significant of these disputes have been disclosed in Telenor's annual reports since 2014. Today's settlement will close all, except two, issues between dtac and CAT, and will also bar the parties from bringing new claims pertaining to the concession regime. The two issues not included in the overall settlement with CAT are two industry cases related to revenue sharing concerning excise tax and interconnection charges, both disclosed in the annual report 2017.<br/>Telenor has previously made provisions of around NOK 0.4 bn for some of the disputes which are now included in the settlement between dtac and CAT. The remaining amount of around NOK 2.1 bn will be provided for in Q4 2018 as \"Other income and expenses\".<br/>dtac's payment to CAT will be made in installments. The first installment of THB 6.8 bn (around NOK 1.8 bn) will be made once the final approval from the Annual General Meeting is obtained.

The steps we have taken over the past two years have laid the foundation for continued value creation. The third quarter was an important milestone for us in Thailand, as the concession model came to an end. We are very pleased how the transition to the licence model has been executed, removing uncertainty and securing significant access to spectrum and infrastructure. We now have a solid platform to deliver superior data services to our customers and create value in the growing Thai market. In Norway, network quality is key to our customers and we are proud to have the world's fastest mobile network. Our mobile customer base grew for the first time in three years and in addition, we continued to expand our fibre network and connected close to 9,000 households during the quarter. In both Pakistan and Bangladesh revenue trends improved, while competition in Myanmar intensified following the entrance of a fourth mobile operator. We also successfully completed the sale of our operations in Central and Eastern Europe and will continue to drive our transformation forward with a clear focus on growth, efficiency and simplification.
