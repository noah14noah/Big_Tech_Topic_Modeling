However, their promised changes have yet to be fully realised. During last week\u2019s Money Next virtual summit, finance professionals were asked their thoughts on where certain trends and topics are on the Gartner hype cycle in which products first get a \u2018peak of inflated expectation\u2019, dropping into a \u2018trough of disillusionment\u2019 before maturing and finally gaining acceptance in mainstream markets.    The consensus among the panel was that while open banking and open finance have been much hyped about for many years, the idea is starting to show promise with plenty of opportunities for growth.    \u201cOpen banking for a while was hyped along with some delays around rollout and adoption\u201d, says Lucy Demery, global head of fintech banking at Standard Chartered.     Whitepaper     \u201cNow its going pretty well, it\u2019s really ramping up. There\u2019s been some really impressive strides, pushing further into other financial products. There\u2019s much more to be seen in connecting that with wider e-commerce and big tech platforms here in the UK and Europe.\u201d    Scott Abrahams, group head acceptance and emerging payments at Mastercard said that the concept of open banking still hasn\u2019t done enough to sway consumers to adopt.    \u201cOld payment methods that are still kicking around because they are still pretty good for a majority of consumers.    75, 77 and 74 percent of Samsung Pay, Apple Pay and Google Pay users said they either use a credit or debit card as their default payment method respectively for mobile payments in a report by Deloitte in 2019.    Abrahams added that the main value proposition payment providers like Mastercard, Visa and American Express provide is predictability and reliability.    \u201cThe main piece of value in Mastercard isn\u2019t that billions of people have a means of payment with two circles on it. It\u2019s the shops both physical and online, where you use a payment product and it\u2019s exactly the same whether you\u2019re in Brazil, in North America, in Poland or the UK. Not many [new providers] businesses have sold on that over the years.\u201d    Financial consultancy firm, 11:FS\u2019s Deputy CEO, Jason Bates said that \u201c[Open banking] is a technology in need of a problem.\u201d    \u201cWhat is the thing that\u2019s going to drive millions, if not billions of people to use open banking? It\u2019s not going to be the ability to see statements from three or four banks in one app. For me it will be intelligence services, private banking for the mass market. Having an intelligent agent help with your spending, your utility switching and moving around savings, to be that financial advisor.\u201d    \u201cCryptocurrency is overhyped\u201d, said Bates. \u201cI think crypto assets and distributed ledger has amazing opportunity . In the end, cryptocurrency isn\u2019t a currency. We don\u2019t use it for transactions. There are however, great opportunities for the technology behind cryptocurrency to find its way out of the pit of despair of the Gartner curve.\u201d    Many of his panel members agreed and said that as a payments method, cryptocurrencies have a long way to go.    \u201cFrom a payments perspective, [crypto] is starting to creep back up. However, the use of cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology is much wider than just payments. From our perspective, there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity there, but it\u2019s past the high praise,\u201d says Abrahams.    The most immediate use AI and machine learning right now is in the back end said Demery, conducting data collection and analytics. On the consumer side, both the technology and customer are still not ready to fully adopt.    \u201cFor portfolio analytics on the institutional side or credit, both consumer and institutional is one area to look out for. There\u2019s a lot more that can be done to help incumbents get better and more efficient often in partnership with fintechs, but also incumbents in their own right.    Another use case for machine learning is pushing/nudging consumers towards financial products or services that would suit their needs but Demery said this can often be tricky.    \u201cIt\u2019s tricky in terms of complexity, but also in terms of risk around suitability and mis-selling especially in the retail space.\u201d    Consumer trust in AI remains low, a survey conducted by Capegemini in 2019 found that three quarters of respondents wanted more transparency is AI-powered  services. A similar number also indicating they believed further regulation for the use of AI was needed.    \u201cThe key for AI is there\u2019s a real opportunity about the human engagement alongside a digital twin but it needs to be delivered effectively,\u201d said Stephen Ingledew, chief executive at FinTech Scotland.    Another 2019 survey done by Pegasystems found 68 percent trust a human more than an AI to approve bank loans, while only 30 percent feeling comfortable with a business using AI is consumer interaction.    Abrahams said that future for AI in the retail space needs to partner with a person. He gave an example of an AI assistant who could identify areas of financial improvements for a customer but ultimately any decision is only made with a financial advisor.    \u201cI think people are ready for that. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re ready at the moment to go one step further and say I trust [an AI] to tell me to do the right thing, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do blindly.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Libra was, of course, cloaked in corporate-speak that promised lower costs and more freedom for consumers and businesses through \"innovation\" or \"inclusion\" or \"scalability.\" But the hubris, from a company with such a mottled record complying with privacy, data and other laws, was so galling that it sparked something rare these days: bipartisan condemnation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What should really concern critics, though, is that Libra is a small part of a larger, more troubling trend: the blurring line between finance and commerce. This trend, now a few decades old, has significant implications for customer privacy, competition, financial risk, and concentrated economic and political power. Stopping Libra would be a sign that policymakers are starting to take these issues seriously, but unwinding the threat of the industry-finance colossus will be much harder.</p><p>In his 1936 message to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt  warned of the risks from \"domination of government by financial and industrial groups, numerically small but politically dominant.\" With such concerns in mind, our nation has held that it's critical to separate banking from commercial business - even enshrining this principle in policy. In practice, however, legal loopholes created by lawyers and lobbyists let financial and commercial companies combine under the same corporate structure.</p><p>First, industrial companies opened their own banks because, as the robber Willie Sutton once put it, \"That's where the money is.\" These \"industrial loan\" companies are state-chartered banks owned by nonfinancial corporations like Harley-Davidson and Target to make loans, offer credit cards or process transactions. They are allowed to take customer deposits without the same oversight that applies to most banks. For example, their nonfinancial parent companies are not subject to oversight by a banking agency, regulators have fewer tools to address solvency issues, and these banks have fewer restrictions on their activities in the event that they fail to serve the credit needs of their communities. It's an attractive proposition because deposits are a cheap source of funding, government-provided deposit insurance covers losses up to a certain amount, and retailers are able to drum up business by financing customer purchases.</p><p>Industrial loan companies were a sleepy part of the financial marketplace until big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot saw an opportunity and applied to open their own banks, in the face of opposition from community banks, consumer groups and labor unions. In the lead-up to the financial crisis, giant commercial lenders GMAC and GE Capital  used their banks to access cheap deposits to fund some of their risky activities, like packaging securities backed by risky mortgages, leading to billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts.</p><p>Unfortunately, instead of eliminating this loophole, the 2010 Wall Street reform law called only for a three-year pause to study   industrial bank charters. While there were no industrial charter applications from 2011 to 2016, Big Tech is now looking to come through the door that Congress left open, and regulators in the Trump administration have signaled  willingness to entertain their applications. So far, these applications have largely been limited to firms that already offer financial services, such as the $28 billion payment company Square. But companies like Facebook and Amazon probably aren't far behind. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Meanwhile, the 1999 law that repealed the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act also allowed banks to own and operate commercial businesses. In congressional testimony, a JPMorgan executive argued that becoming a diversified financial holding company would allow it to offer new conveniences such as opening an in-house travel agency to serve its credit card customers.</p><p>It's one thing for a bank to make a loan to, or hold publicly traded shares in, a company with millions of shareholders. But things get more treacherous when a bank is the owner and operator of a company that gives it special insights, market advantages, and the ability to influence nonfinancial businesses in a way that benefits its own financial positions but costs everyone else. For example, a bank that owns an oil terminal could give its commodity traders special insights on regional oil supplies or even seek to control the flow of oil, depending upon its bets in the oil futures markets. That is why banks are supposed to keep the businesses they own at arm's length through financial and management firewalls, such as limits on the amount of capital a bank can commit to these businesses and prohibitions against involvement in day-to-day operations.</p><p>But investigations in 2013 and 2014 by two Senate committees revealed that banks were regularly exceeding legal limits on ownership and control. Businesses that rely on aluminum, for instance, reported that a metals warehouse owned by Goldman Sachs was driving up the cost of that commodity, raising the price of products such as canned beer and soda. JPMorgan used its energy trading business to manipulate energy markets, making consumers pay higher electricity rates. After these scandals, regulators promised reforms, but five years later, they have done nothing.</p><p>This is the real threat of Libra.  Facebook could eventually open its own bank and provide  a full suite of credit and payment services. Under that arrangement, it could offer favorable credit terms and faster transactions to customers who use its banking services at affiliated retailers. Conversely, Citigroup could open an online retailer, offering lower prices to its bank customers. Either of these scenarios would spell trouble for small banks and retailers forced to compete on an unlevel playing field against big businesses with outsize market power.</p><p>Then there's the question of privacy. Commingling a digital marketplace with all of a customer's financial information, including purchases and deposits, is bad for consumers and taxpayers. First, it centralizes sensitive information - contradicting the supposed purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies - giving banks and tech companies the ability to mine customers' data and determine the maximum price that each is willing or able to pay. Second, concentrating so much customer information in a single entity also makes it extra vulnerable to data breaches and abuse. Third, combining a merchant with banking, payment and credit services has the potential to undermine important consumer protections, including credit reporting, debt collection and wage garnishment, giving a single company powerful leverage over its customers by reporting negative information about them, denying their transactions, accessing their bank account funds and so on.</p><p>Finally, allowing nonfinancial businesses access to the federal financial support programs that backstop our banking system   could lead to taxpayer-funded bailouts for troubled retailers, tech companies and others. There are supposed to be firewalls preventing this, but those contain holes of their own.</p><p>Consider how all of this is already playing out: The largest Japanese online marketplace, Rakuten, has applied for a U.S. industrial loan company charter, prompting the banking industry's largest trade association to raise concerns about \"the free flow of credit, consumer privacy and possible conflicts of interest.\" Walmart recently filed a patent application to create its own cryptocurrency, and Amazon is targeting its less-creditworthy customers with a subprime credit card, which has higher rates,  that can be used only on its platforms.</p><p>Louis Brandeis said of the early-20th-century trusts that \"both the financial concentration and the combinations which they have served were, in the main, against the public interest.\" Big banks and big tech may rely on fancy algorithms and apps instead of railroads, but his words are just as true today.</p><p>Regardless of whether Facebook backs away from its proposal voluntarily or is forced to do so, public officials need to send a clear message that any other companies contemplating a similar scheme should think again. It wasn't the first company to have this idea, and it surely won't be the last.</p><p>Twitter: @steelewheelz</p><p>  , the staff director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, was the minority chief counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing &amp; Urban Affairs and a member of the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-997185c8-bebb-11e9-9b73-fd3c65ef8f9c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV9-1291-JBFW-C4DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 18, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Stopping Libra would be a sign that policymakers are starting to take these issues seriously, but unwinding the threat of the industry-finance colossus will be much harder. </p><p>In his 1936 message to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt  warned of the risks from \"domination of government by financial and industrial groups, numerically small but politically dominant.\" With such concerns in mind, our nation has held that it's critical to separate banking from commercial business - even enshrining this principle in policy. In practice, however, legal loopholes created by lawyers and lobbyists let financial and commercial companies combine under the same corporate structure.</p><p>First, industrial companies opened their own banks because, as the robber Willie Sutton once put it, \"That's where the money is.\" These \"industrial loan\" companies are state-chartered banks owned by nonfinancial corporations like Harley-Davidson and Target to make loans, offer credit cards or process transactions. They are allowed to take customer deposits without the same oversight that applies to most banks. For example, their nonfinancial parent companies are not subject to oversight by a banking agency, regulators have fewer tools to address solvency issues, and these banks have fewer restrictions on their activities in the event that they fail to serve the credit needs of their communities. It's an attractive proposition because deposits are a cheap source of funding, government-provided deposit insurance covers losses up to a certain amount, and retailers are able to drum up business by financing customer purchases.</p><p>Industrial loan companies were a sleepy part of the financial marketplace until big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot saw an opportunity and applied to open their own banks, in the face of opposition from community banks, consumer groups and labor unions. In the lead-up to the financial crisis, giant commercial lenders GMAC and GE Capital  used their banks to access cheap deposits to fund some of their risky activities, like packaging securities backed by risky mortgages, leading to billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts. </p><p>Unfortunately, instead of eliminating this loophole, the 2010 Wall Street reform law called only for a three-year pause to study   industrial bank charters. While there were no industrial charter applications from 2011 to 2016, Big Tech is now looking to come through the door that Congress left open, and regulators in the Trump administration have signaled  willingness to entertain their applications. So far, these applications have largely been limited to firms that already offer financial services, such as the $28 billion payment company Square. But companies like Facebook and Amazon probably aren't far behind. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) </p><p>Meanwhile, the 1999 law that repealed the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act also allowed banks to own and operate commercial businesses. In congressional testimony, a JPMorgan executive argued that becoming a diversified financial holding company would allow it to offer new conveniences such as opening an in-house travel agency to serve its credit card customers.  </p><p>It's one thing for a bank to make a loan to, or hold publicly traded shares in, a company with millions of shareholders. But things get more treacherous when a bank is the owner and operator of a company that gives it special insights, market advantages, and the ability to influence nonfinancial businesses in a way that benefits its own financial positions but costs everyone else. For example, a bank that owns an oil terminal could give its commodity traders special insights on regional oil supplies or even seek to control the flow of oil, depending upon its bets in the oil futures markets. That is why banks are supposed to keep the businesses they own at arm's length through financial and management firewalls, such as limits on the amount of capital a bank can commit to these businesses and prohibitions against involvement in day-to-day operations.  </p><p>But investigations in 2013 and 2014 by two Senate committees revealed that banks were regularly exceeding legal limits on ownership and control. Businesses that rely on aluminum, for instance, reported that a metals warehouse owned by Goldman Sachs was driving up the cost of that commodity, raising the price of products such as canned beer and soda. JPMorgan used its energy trading business to manipulate energy markets, making consumers pay higher electricity rates. After these scandals, regulators promised reforms, but five years later, they have done nothing.</p><p>This is the real threat of Libra.  Facebook could eventually open its own bank and provide  a full suite of credit and payment services. Under that arrangement, it could offer favorable credit terms and faster transactions to customers who use its banking services at affiliated retailers. Conversely, Citigroup could open an online retailer, offering lower prices to its bank customers. Either of these scenarios would spell trouble for small banks and retailers forced to compete on an unlevel playing field against big businesses with outsize market power.</p><p>Then there's the question of privacy. Commingling a digital marketplace with all of a customer's financial information, including purchases and deposits, is bad for consumers and taxpayers. First, it centralizes sensitive information - contradicting the supposed purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies - giving banks and tech companies the ability to mine customers' data and determine the maximum price that each is willing or able to pay. Second, concentrating so much customer information in a single entity also makes it extra vulnerable to data breaches and abuse. Third, combining a merchant with banking, payment and credit services has the potential to undermine important consumer protections, including credit reporting, debt collection and wage garnishment, giving a single company powerful leverage over its customers by reporting negative information about them, denying their transactions, accessing their bank account funds and so on.  </p><p>Finally, allowing nonfinancial businesses access to the federal financial support programs that backstop our banking system   could lead to taxpayer-funded bailouts for troubled retailers, tech companies and others. There are supposed to be firewalls preventing this, but those contain holes of their own. </p><p>Consider how all of this is already playing out: The largest Japanese online marketplace, Rakuten, has applied for a U.S. industrial loan company charter, prompting the banking industry's largest trade association to raise concerns about \"the free flow of credit, consumer privacy and possible conflicts of interest.\" Walmart recently filed a patent application to create its own cryptocurrency, and Amazon is targeting its less-creditworthy customers with a subprime credit card, which has higher rates,  that can be used only on its platforms. </p><p>Louis Brandeis said of the early-20th-century trusts that \"both the financial concentration and the combinations which they have served were, in the main, against the public interest.\" Big banks and big tech may rely on fancy algorithms and apps instead of railroads, but his words are just as true today.</p><p>Regardless of whether Facebook backs away from its proposal voluntarily or is forced to do so, public officials need to send a clear message that any other companies contemplating a similar scheme should think again. It wasn't the first company to have this idea, and it surely won't be the last.</p><p>Twitter: @steelewheelz</p><p>                , the staff director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, was the minority chief counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing &amp;

Since then dozens of scam websites offering high-paying bonds that claimed to be safe and protected by the FSCS have appeared in search results. They have a Google \"Ad\" logo, indicating the client paid for the promotion. Google said it took down scam web-sites when notified. It blamed poor FCA guidance about what constitutes a mini-bond for making it difficult to implement the rules. The FCA insists that its rules are clear.</p><p>Last year a Times investigation revealed that Google was taking huge fees from scammers who use its search engine to persuade savers to invest in risky or potentially fraudulent schemes. Google said that it would stop promoting sites with \"misleading content\". The mini-bonds ban comes after the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance, a provider advertised on Google that took \u00a3236 million from savers.</p><p>Responding to email questions by Mark Taber, an investor and campaigner, about whether Google should take more responsibility for adverts and if they are subject to rules governing financial promotions, Mr Bailey said: \"There has been a view that it doesn't apply to this form of advertising. We are challenging that view.\"</p><p>Mr Bailey revealed that he had made repeated calls for online harms legislation, which seeks to tackle child abuse, terrorism and fake news, to cover online scams.

Since then dozens of scam websites offering high-paying bonds that claimed to be safe and protected by the FSCS have appeared in search results. They have a Google \"Ad\" logo, indicating the client paid for the promotion. Google said it took down scam web-sites when notified. It blamed poor FCA guidance about what constitutes a mini-bond for making it difficult to implement the rules. The FCA insists that its rules are clear.</p><p>Last year a Times investigation revealed that Google was taking huge fees from scammers who use its search engine to persuade savers to invest in risky or potentially fraudulent schemes. Google said that it would stop promoting sites with \"misleading content\". The mini-bonds ban comes after the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance, a provider advertised on Google that took \u00a3236 million from savers.</p><p>Responding to email questions by Mark Taber, an investor and campaigner, about whether Google should take more responsibility for adverts and if they are subject to rules governing financial promotions, Mr Bailey said: \"There has been a view that it doesn't apply to this form of advertising. We are challenging that view.\"</p><p>Mr Bailey revealed that he had made repeated calls for online harms legislation, which seeks to tackle child abuse, terrorism and fake news, to cover online scams. Searches for \"top Isa deals\" and \"FSCS protected bonds\" last week highlighted several scam sites using the logos of well-known brands, including newspapers and high street banks, without permission.</p><p>A video of Martin Lewis, who founded <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.MoneySavingExpert.com\">www.MoneySavingExpert.com</url>, appeared on a scam website last week.

Since then dozens of scam websites offering high-paying bonds that claimed to be safe and protected by the FSCS have appeared in search results. They have a Google \"Ad\" logo, indicating the client paid for the promotion.</p><p>Google said it took down scam websites when notified. It blamed poor FCA guidance about what constitutes a mini-bond for making it difficult to implement the rules. The FCA insists that its rules are clear.</p><p>Last year a</p><p>                   Times                    </p><p>investigation revealed that Google was taking huge fees from scammers who use its search engine to persuade savers to invest in risky or potentially fraudulent schemes. Google said that it would stop promoting sites with \"misleading content\". The mini-bonds ban comes after the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance, a provider advertised on Google that took \u00a3236 million from savers.</p><p>Responding to email questions by Mark Taber, an investor and campaigner, about whether Google should take more responsibility for adverts and if they are subject to rules governing financial promotions, Mr Bailey said: \"There has been a view that it doesn't apply to this form of advertising. We are challenging that view.\"</p><p>Mr Bailey revealed that he had made repeated calls for online harms legislation, which seeks to tackle child abuse, terrorism and fake news, to cover online scams. Searches for \"top Isa deals\" and \"FSCS protected bonds\" last week highlighted several scam sites using the logos of well-known brands, including newspapers and high street banks, without permission.</p><p>A video of Martin Lewis, who founded MoneySavingExpert.com, appeared on a scam website last week. Mr Lewis, who last year challenged Facebook over adverts claiming that he backed investment scams, said he had nothing to do with it: \"When I get an email telling me yet again that a big tech firm has facilitated a scammer in abusing and stealing people's money and using my reputation to do so, I find it offensive.\"</p><p>Google said: \"When ads breach our policy, we take appropriate action. We are working with regulators such as the FCA on further clarity in this area to protect consumers.\" It added that anyone trying to implement the FCA guideline faced a challenge in defining what is legally considered a mini-bond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-59548627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y18-PMT1-JCJY-G2N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Since then dozens of scam websites offering high-paying bonds that claimed to be safe and protected by the FSCS have appeared in search results. They have a Google \"Ad\" logo, indicating the client paid for the promotion. Google said it took down scam web-sites when notified. It blamed poor FCA guidance about what constitutes a mini-bond for making it difficult to implement the rules. The FCA insists that its rules are clear.</p><p>Last year a Times investigation revealed that Google was taking huge fees from scammers who use its search engine to persuade savers to invest in risky or potentially fraudulent schemes. Google said that it would stop promoting sites with \"misleading content\". The mini-bonds ban comes after the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance, a provider advertised on Google that took \u00a3236 million from savers.</p><p>Responding to email questions by Mark Taber, an investor and campaigner, about whether Google should take more responsibility for adverts and if they are subject to rules governing financial promotions, Mr Bailey said: \"There has been a view that it doesn't apply to this form of advertising. We are challenging that view.\"</p><p>Mr Bailey revealed that he had made repeated calls for online harms legislation, which seeks to tackle child abuse, terrorism and fake news, to cover online scams. Searches for \"top Isa deals\" and \"FSCS protected bonds\" last week highlighted several scam sites using the logos of well-known brands, including newspapers and high street banks, without permission.</p><p>A video of Martin Lewis, who founded <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.MoneySavingExpert.com\">www.MoneySavingExpert.com</url>, appeared on a scam website last week. Mr Lewis, who last year challenged Facebook over adverts claiming that he backed investment scams, said he had nothing to do with it: \"When I get an email telling me yet again that a big tech firm has facilitated a scammer in abusing and stealing people's money and using my reputation to do so, I find it offensive.\"</p><p>Google said: \"When ads breach our policy, we take appropriate action. We are working with regulators such as the FCA on further clarity in this area to protect consumers.\" It added that anyone trying to implement the FCA guideline faced a challenge in defining what is legally considered a mini-bond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-156687402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y19-H1V1-JCBW-N10K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This announcement provides further support for the U.S. to fight Huawei's continued effort to take market share in both the U.S. and Europe. -WSJ[6]Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, recognizing the importance of Chinese business to the European economy, has refused to completely ban Huawei's business. -Bloomberg[7]The coronavirus could cost the American tourism industry $5.8 billion in airfare and domestic spending this year. -WSJ[8]The coronavirus has led to lower demand for oil from China, the world's largest importer of oil. Futures were up on Wednesday, however, on hopes that the spread of the virus was slowing. -WSJ[9] andBloomberg[10]The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) admitted to violating its own rules when it failed to ensure that Southwest Airlines Co.

The same FAA office routinely failed to oversee the verified takeoff weights of Southwest jets. -WSJ[11] andBloomberg[12]Vice Media Group faces issues paying back the private-equity firm, TPG, that invested $450 million in 2017. Vice's new CEO inherited the company's financial troubles and 'has tried to remedy the problems by diversifying the company away from relying on advertising sales.' The company still has potential, shoring up some of its losses in 2019. -WSJ[13]Nissan Motor Co. sued Carlos Ghosn in a Japanese court this week, seeking $90 million in damages for Mr. Ghosn's alleged wrongdoing. Nissan's most recent claim looks to recover costs related to the company's investigation into Mr. Ghosn. You may remember a Daily Dose mentioning Mr. Ghosn fleeing to Lebanon from Japan in December of last year. -WSJ[14] andBloomberg[15]Robo-analysts may soon take Wall Street jobs, while making you a bit

The news makes Apple 'one of the first companies to publicly disclose the extent of the chain effect from China and the virus on the business world' - NYTimes[2] and WSJ[3] and Bloomberg[4] HSBC will cut upwards of 35,000 jobs in the next three years as the London-based bank struggles to 'revive a business that has come to depend increasingly on China for growth.' That strategy has been hampered by various headwinds, including recent political strife in Hong Kong, but to be sure, the coronavirus isn't helping anything - NYTimes[5] and WSJ[6] and Bloomberg[7]Pier 1 Imports has officially filed for bankruptcy and is pursuing a sale of the company. The news comes just weeks after the home goods retailer revealed that it was closing more than half of its stores - NYTimes[8] and WSJ[9] and Bloomberg[10] and MarketWatch[11]The country's largest milk cooperative\u2014the Dairy Farmers of America\u2014will buy up 44 of bankrupt milk company Dean Foods' facilities 'as well as the real estate, inventory and equipment necessary to operate them.' </p><p>The deal is subject to approval by the bankruptcy judge overseeing Dean's case as well as federal regulators weighing the antitrust implications of any such deal - NYTimes[12] and WSJ[13]And the buying continues. France's Alstom conglomerate is snapping up Bombardier Inc.'s train unit 'in a deal valued at $8.2 billion, including debt' that creates 'what would be a new, European-focused train giant big enough to take on China.' The train exchange occurs just a week after Bombardier sold its interest in a commercial-jet joint-venture with Airbus SE, leaving the Canadian firm with only its business-jet operations - WSJ[14] and MarketWatch[15] and Bloomberg[16]Zuck's getting the headlines he presumably wants\u2014that he's on record calling for EU regulators to force internet platforms like Facebook with more liability for the content shared by their users\u2014but many European officials are less impressed by this middle-ground approach (by contrast to Facebook, newspapers 'shoulder full liability for the content they publish') - WSJ[17] and MarketWatch[18]By contrast, Jeff Bezos' play for good press this week took the less-debatable form of $10 billion pledge to fight climate change\u2014the 'biggest philanthropic move to date for the world's richest man' - WSJ[19] and Bloomberg[20] and MarketWatch[21] and NYTimes[22]What's old is new again at DuPont, which is reinstating former CEO Edward Breen\u2014an 'architect of the megamerger and spinoff that left a smaller industrial-materials maker struggling to generate sales growth'\u2014to the top job less than a year after a new leadership team took the helm - WSJ[23] and MarketWatch[24]Meet Maze, the [presumably Catholic] ransomware ring that incorporates a heavy dose of shame into the standard playbook of hacking, stealing, encrypting, and extorting - Law360[25]Streetwise suggests we're fast approaching the end of the bond-market-as-volatility-backstop era after a pretty glorious 2-decade run as 'a form of free insurance for investors' - WSJ[26]A federal jury in the Eastern District of Missouri has delivered a $265 million verdict against Bayer's Monsanto unit and BASF over claims that their dicamba weedkiller caused the 'decimation of a large Missouri peach farm' due to the neighboring cotton farm's use of the herbicide - Law360[27]Our latest installment of 'let's blame the millennials,'\u2014an exercise seemingly tailor-made for boomers tired of getting saddled with the current state of world affairs\u2014suggests that the generation's tilt toward aggressive saving 'could leave central bankers with less room to cut interest rates, which they have long done to boost growth in times of economic trouble.' In other words, blame the next recession and subsequent fallout on the 24-39 year-olds with their hearts set on early retirement. Sure.

The Fed's rate is also 0 - 0.25%, which matches the low hit during the '08 financial crisis. This is a reaction to the substantial toll COVID-19 has begun to take on the U.S. economy. </p><p>Fiscal authorities will have to get creative to lessen the blow of this virulent black swan. -Bloomberg[3]andWSJ[4]andNYT[5]For more on oil, crash here. -WSJ[6]Bitcoin collapsed by 57% from its $10,500 high back on February 13; alt coins also tumbled, with Ethereum down by 20% and Litecoin down by 17%. -Bloomberg[7]Big Tech has been acquiring almost every promising AI startup. Those that believe in diverse competition, however, believe AI startups should look to remain independent. But limited exit options remain the main driver behind the current trend. -Bloomberg[8]The COVID-19 shopping panic has strained Amazon.com Inc.'s online grocery services. The increase in orders resulted in the company delaying Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods market orders over the weekend. -Bloomberg[9]andWSJ[10]Big Law learned from its mistakes before the 2008 crash, which means they are well positioned to take care of their clients during the current financial storm. - Law360[11]New York and California seek to expand their 'state regulatory power over consumer financial services, saying federal oversight has become lax under the Trump administration.' -WSJ[12]Amazon's cashierless stores remain taboo among big retailers, but Amazon will continue to try and persuade them to join the 'Go' store revolution. -WSJ[13]Airlines have had to make cuts to staff and rethink their flight schedules. Flights might be a bargain, but is it worth the risk? -NYT[14]On greed: A man with 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer, may face charges for price gouging. Perhaps Socrates can console him,'He who is not contented with what he has, would not be contented with what he would like to have.' -NYT[15] [ 1]: <url

Hence, climbing Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon stocks, even as 'analysts have trimmed expectations for all three companies' quarterly earnings, which they'll report this week' - NYTimes[5]A strong Q1 (despite a slowdown in ad sales) won't hurt Alphabet's chances of staying in that conversation, too - Bloomberg[6] and MarketWatch[7] and WSJ[8]Let's just say that the Small Business Administration finds a way to get PPP round #2 money out to American businesses (no sure bet based on Day 1). That means $670 billion in aid has flowed from the government in recent weeks\u2014nearly all of it, as it turns out, without the usual audit requirement aimed at catching fraud or egregious errors on the front end. </p><p>And that means that any efforts to do so on the backend will be, in a word, difficult - WSJ[9]Lobbyists are working overtime in an effort to push the White House and Congress to 'shield American companies from a wide range of potential lawsuits related to reopening the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, opening a new legal and political fight over how the nation deals with the fallout from Covid-19' - NYTimes[10] and Law360[11]On cue, Simon Group\u2014the country's biggest mall operator\u2014has laid out plans for reopening nearly 50 of them in 10 states by next week - NYTimes[12]JetBlue will now require masks for all of its passengers from the beginning to end of their trip, the first major U.S. carrier to implement such a policy - NYTimes[13]Boeing, meanwhile, is facing 'criminal and civil scrutiny into years of widespread quality-control lapses on its 737 Max line'\u2014inquiries that build on 'a federal grand-jury investigation into hazardously designed flight-control systems' at the planemaker - WSJ[14]Zuck and crew have made major changes in Facebook's security teams over the past week, a shift in strategy that 'displaces more than two dozen employees' and affects detection-engineering and alert-response groups. According to insiders, the 'latest cuts are part of a change in philosophy on security efforts, spurred by infighting and long-running issues within the department' - NYTimes[15]The shakeup is just the latest in a months-long effort from Zuck to assert himself, leaving him 'more actively and visibly in charge than he has been in years' - WSJ[16]Concerns about 'de-risking' have prompted the Government Accountability Office to press the Fed and FDIC to revisit AML regs in an effort to ensure that banks aren't 'limiting services or ending relationships to avoid 'perceived regulatory concerns about facilitating money laundering'' - Law360[17]U.S. securities regulators are reportedly investigating Luckin Coffee's recent disclosure that 'some of its employees cooked its books last year.' The thoroughness of the SEC's probe of the Chinese-based Starbucks rival, however, will depend squarely on 'how much information is shared by Chinese regulators, who are staging their own probe' - WSJ[18]Questions left unresolved after a special audit of Wirecard AG's accounting practices helped drive shares in the German electronics-payments giant down more than 25% on Tuesday - WSJ[19]And here you are thinking you'd make it to midweek without mention of the Pentagon's UFO videos. Oh, no no no no.

And Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple are at the center of it all - NYTimes[5] and WSJ[6]The serious threat of a new, immediately southern front[7] in the White House's trade war sent markets reeling[8] and has led companies who 'sought refuge in a country with a long, stable relationship with the United States' as a way to deal with the US/China trade dispute to wonder if anywhere's safe these days - NYTimes[9]Here's a deeper dive into the expansive scope of the intended tariffs on Mexican goods - WSJ[10]And while we're talking trade, how about the news late last week that the US was 'stripping India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars of its products from American tariffs'\u2014a move prompted by India's purported refusal to give the U.S. 'equitable and reasonable access to its markets' - NYTimes[11] and Bloomberg[12]A bit of helpful global historical context to understand just why the Fed cares so much about the persistently sub-2% US inflation mark - WSJ[13]A NY state jury hit Johnson ...hnson with a big-time $300 million punitive damages verdict after finding the company 'responsible for a woman's mesothelioma she developed after decades of using J...alc bath products' - Law360[14]As if Amazon doesn't have enough on its disruption plate, the Journal gives us the heads up that Bezos .... have their sights set on your next apartment through its Alexa Smart Properties project - WSJ[15]We won't grant him 'prison lawyer' status yet, but Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli has managed to file a $30 million lawsuit against the 'three main actors in what he calls an illegal scheme to oust him from biotech company Retrophin Inc.</p><p>years before he was convicted of defrauding its investors' despite his current status behind bars - Law360[16]UC Irvine law professor (and ex-Wall Street lawyer) Mehrsa Baradaran has a plan for bringing 'government-backed competition' into the banking sector by offering public banking services to the unbanked via the United States Post Office\u2014a service not seen in America since the 1960s. An interesting side effect of this postal banking proposal could be, you know, saving the postal service while she's at it - WSJ[17]VW's solution to rebuilding the trust of Americans (and others) in the wake of its global emissions scandal may just come in the form of currywurst.

FiatChrysler broke news late yesterday that it's withdrawing its offer to merge with France's Renault, mere weeks after the companies bowled over the auto world with the proposal. Fiat blamed the French government for taking too long to support the deal, though it appears Nissan also played a role in the deal's demise - WSJ[1] and Bloomberg[2] and NYTimes[3]The news came on the heels of (though's likely unrelated to) allegations from a top US FiatChrysler exec who accused the company of cutting his pay 'in retaliation for cooperating with a federal investigation in the U.S. into its sales -reporting practices' - MarketWatch[4] and Law360[5]Boeing, in desperate need of good news these days, is finding itself in the middle of just the opposite, as the ongoing US trade war with China now appears to threaten a $30 billion deal with Chinese airlines to purchase roughly 100 of Boeing's wide-body jetliners - Bloomberg[6]No shocker here. This week's news that the FTC and DOJ are eyeing Big Tech has only heightened the expected lobbying fervor on behalf of the tech titans in D.C.\u2014a town where the big 4 spent a combined $55 million on lobbying last year alone, double from the year before - NYTimes[7]The SEC did, in fact, adopt[8] new rules yesterday for Wall Street brokers offering customers investment advice, but despite its consumer-friendly name (that was Regulation Best Interest, remember?)</p><p>, consumer advocates say the new rules are not only toothless but give a dangerously 'false sense of security' - NYTimes[9] and Law360[10]Despite high-level talks continuing this week and blowback from the Republican Senate, the White House appears primed to deliver on its promise of across-the-board 5% tariffs on all Mexican imports beginning on Monday - Bloomberg[11] and NYTimes[12]Last week's dive on Wall Street wasn't enough, apparently, to alter generally positive vibes emanating from the Fed's recent Beige Book economic survey, which found that US economic activity improved (though modestly) from the last survey period - Bloomberg[13] and MarketWatch[14]Ex-Chicago Mayor and Clinton administration Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel revealed this week that he'll be opening a Chicago outpost for boutique investment bank Centerview Partners LLC as part of his next act - WSJ[15]Treasury Department official Heath Tarbert received overwhelming Senate support and has been confirmed as new head of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He'll succeed outgoing chair Christopher Giancarlo next month - Law360[16]VW's trying hard to pivot away from its long-running emissions cheating scandal, and it's turning to a new ad campaign to help it along the way. Does it really have any standing to plant a flag in the EV front? You be the [early] judge - NYTimes[17]Four serious suggestions for a better commute? I think we can all make time for that - NYTimes[18] [ 1]: <url

The deal to reunite the former partners, which closed late yesterday, was pushed by National Amusements' chief Shari Redstone since 2016 and hasted along recently by the precipitous fall from grace of CBS' Les Moonves last year - NYTimes[1] and Bloomberg[2]The OCC has 'rebuked' Wells Fargo's HR department over a 'massive backlog of employee complaints and compensation structures that don't do enough to prevent the kind of behavior that led to its 2016 fake-account scandal' - WSJ[3]Following a clash with Board Chair Barry Diller, Expedia's CEO and COO have resigned from the travel company. Company stock has fallen some 12% in 2019 as the operation has struggled with the fallout of changed Google search functions that has dramatically altered Expedia's number of free links on the search engine - WSJ[4] and Bloomberg[5] and MarketWatch[6]Federal Trade Commission authorities are broadening their antitrust probe of Amazon, reportedly interviewing a series of software companies about 'practices around Amazon's cloud unit, known as Amazon Web Services.'

In short, value stocks now 'perform better when the yield curve gets steeper, meaning the difference between long- and short-term government bond yields widens' - WSJ[15]Italian tax authorities are accusing FiatChrysler of underestimating the value of its American business by $5.6 billion, 'presenting the carmaker with a potentially hefty bill as it prepares to merger with French rival PSA Group.' The claims stem from an audit of Fiat's 2014 acquisition of Chrysler and the restricting that occurred immediately after that deal - Bloomberg[16]I'm admittedly late to the Claire Saffitz party, so let me remedy that by lobbying for a regular Bon Appetit buddy comedy show with her and 'It's Alive' host Brad Leone.

Just today we are experiencing the take-off of digital banking and the rise of fintech, even the tech giants, big tech, are immersed in this market.<br/>According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global body, technological innovation in the financial sector has the potential to significantly change the functioning of the system, with a number of potential benefits and also risks and challenges.</p><p><br/>\"The digitization of finance delivers potentially great benefits in terms of efficiency and inclusion. However, rapid progress can also present challenges and create risks,\" the FSB notes.<br/>In its fifth annual report released a few days ago, the agency emphasizes that some of the risks are related to the protection of consumers, crypto-assets and the growing market share that fintech and big tech are having.<br/>In this regard, the FSB emphasizes that, together with other international organizations, digitization trends have been monitored, with the aim of taking advantage of the benefits and mitigating risks, which has resulted in a better understanding of implications of these trends and allow for continuous dialogue between public, private and academic stakeholders.<br/>Pros and cons<br/>In the document, the board notes that many of these new technologies could decentralize the provision of financial services, and that we even see some examples in payments and settlement, capital markets, trade finance and loans, among Other.<br/>\"A reduction of intermediaries and centralized processes traditionally involved in the provision of financial services could benefit stability in some way, and can also lead to greater competition and diversity in the system\", Designates.<br/>However, the FSB indicates that at the same time, the increasing use of such technologies could involve a number of financial risks that need to be managed, such as the emergence of concentrations in the ownership and operation of key infrastructure and technology, as well as such as issues of legal liability, consumer protection and resolution.<br/>Cryptoactives and new participants<br/>The FSB refers to the viruses that a specific application of decentralized technology that is already creating opportunities and posing challenges are crypto-actives, which is why international agencies are already working on issues related to the protection of market integrity, counter-money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as understanding bank exposures to encryption assets and potential risks to financial stability.<br/>\"While crypto-assets do not currently pose a risk to global financial stability, gaps can occur when they are beyond the reach of regulators' authority or the absence of international standards,\" he emphasizes.<br/>It adds that wider use of new types of cryptographic assets, such as global stablecoin for retail payment purposes, ensures careful scrutiny by the authorities to see that they are subject to high standards of Regulation.<br/>With regard to the role of fintech and big tech in the financial services market, the FSB believes that thesethey could also alter the universe of financial service providers, since, for example, the credit granted by these figures is growing rapidly, although it continues in a small proportion of the total financing granted.<br/>Big tech impact may be greater<br/>However, it emphasizes that the competitive impact of big tech can be greater than that of fintech companies, given their usually large and established customer networks, as well as the recognition and trust of the names of these companies. \"Combined with strong financial positions and access to low-cost capital, big tech companies could reach a very rapid scale in financial services.\"<br/>[email protected]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The world's largest financial services company is currently Alibaba Group's Ant Financial, with more than one billion customers and no physical counter. A decade ago it was Citigroup with 200 million customers.<br/>The banks' future agenda is marked by pressure to reduce costs, increase efficiency, simplify customer relationships, implying, according to Carlos Costa, \"a new paradigm of organization in which banks will depend on third parties to infrastructure and specialized human resources. Banks will have to be flexible and fast in (re)action in the face of customer and market requirements, so as not to lose the direct relationship they have built with their customers.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital coins</emphasis><br/>The scale was another aspect underlined by Carlos Costa for the design, production cost and margin associated with financial products intended for the mass market and which makes it possible to fine segmentation of the market, diversify risk and dilute the technological cost. However, this scale can make it dependent on the offer of the big players.<br/>These changes are also challenges for regulators and supervisors, as there are still insufficient empirical studies to assess the implications of digitising the banking sector. In terms of risks, it points both to lower volatility, as well as to the influence of technology for greater volatility and procyclicality. Some predict an increase in systemic risk due to the increased use of artificial intelligence.<br/>According to Carlos Costa, there is consensus on operational risk, because of an operational failure, a cyberattack or insolvency, which can be transformed into risksystemic, because several institutions depend on third parties.<br/>The governor of Banco de Portugal referred to the growing debate for the creation of synthetic digital currencies of central bank, network of digital currencies of central bank and digital monetary areas.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9320691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFB-B851-JBJN-M4K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002RF7</classCode><className>BANCO DE PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

Banks and other financial services firms are crying foul over a 'double standard' that they claim is providing regulatory loopholes for the tech giants to more easily expand their presence in the industry by capitalizing on their platforms and technologies.Naver and Kakao have begun to establish financial businesses. Naver earlier this month launched a cash management account service together with securities firm Mirae Asset Daewoo. The tech company established Naver Financial as a subsidiary last year, after seeing its online payment service grow. </p><p>Kakao has set up an internet bank and also has Kakao Pay, a financial platform based on mobile money transfers. Kakao Pay has acquired an insurtech firm, and is taking steps to establish a separate digital non-life insurer. Kakao Pay also launched a brokerage as a subsidiary, after taking over Baro Investment &amp; Securities.Financial firms are worried as the tech companies have immense potential in the financial sector considering brand awareness, capital and massive amounts of data from their e-commerce platforms. Naver Shopping has grown into Korea's largest e-commerce platform with 30 million users as of the third quarter of last year. Kakao Commerce has seen annual transactions grow to several trillions of won.The rapid growth of the companies' online payment and money transfer services is attributed to Naver and Kakao's respective dominance as the No. 1 web portal and mobile messenger service providers.The firms also pose a threat as they hold an advantage in developing innovative technology-based services.Financial firms are unhappy about the situation as tech companies are subject to lighter regulations even if they offer financial services.They contend the government has been too lax in regulating big tech companies, because they have prioritized fostering innovative technology and services.Banks and financial companies are subject to various regulations in the areas of capital requirement, financial soundness and majority shareholders' qualification.In contrast, if tech giants engage in the electronic banking business, they are controlled by specific laws governing e-transactions which provide leeway for them to get around these stricter regulations.Naver is seen to have held back from launching an internet bank, despite widespread expectations, as internet banks face more regulations than companies offering financial services as non-bank entities.\"Basically, tech companies are offering partial financial services, which frees them from the regulations imposed on the financial sector,\" a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute of Finance said.\"The same regulations are meant to be imposed on the same sort of business, but currently there are blind spots that have not been addressed, which makes the situation unfair.\"The financial authorities have conceded that incentives have been offered for tech companies to foster the fintech industry, but added that attempts will be made to address complaints.\"Up until now the competition was within the finance sector or between firms such as banks, securities firms and insurers. In the future we will see territorial disputes between financial firms and big tech companies,\" Financial Services Commission Chairman Eun Sung-soo said during a recent media briefing.\"Rather than excluding one side, we will introduce policies intended to reduce risk and create a level playing field.\"The FSC is in the process of revising existing regulations, a source said Monday.The KIF research fellow said, 'The lack of regulations may not stand out in the beginning, but will likely become an issue as the scale of their financial businesses grow.''Regulations are necessary because they exist for the purpose of maintaining financial stability and protecting customers,' he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606J-C7R1-DYTP-W1X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 22, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Affiliates &amp;

The comment was written and posted on June 1, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Financial Health Network is submitting this letter in response to the \"Request For Information To Assist the Taskforce on Federal Consumer Financial Law\" issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on April 1st, 2020. The Financial Health Network strongly believes in the importance of consumer protection laws in financial services, and believes that ensuring consumers are well-protected is doubly important in light of the current economic crisis.</p><p>The Financial Health Network is the leading authority on financial health. We are a trusted resource for business leaders, policymakers, and innovators united in a mission to improve the financial health of their customers, employees, and communities. Through research, advisory services, measurement tools, and opportunities for cross-sector collaboration, we advance awareness, understanding, and proven best practices in support of improved financial health for all.</p><p>Our unique position allows us to identify pain points and opportunities from both industry and consumer perspectives and to evaluate the ways policymakers can address those pain points. We believe in public policy that incents market actors to design products and services that build financial health.</p><p>In order to create such a marketplace, policymaking that carefully considers input from all interested stakeholders is vital. While we welcome the opportunity to share our perspective with the Taskforce, we are concerned that the time the Taskforce has allotted for responses is insufficient for us to respond fully to the far-ranging RFI, and that other stakeholders may not have had the opportunity to share their perspectives due to constraints brought on by the COVID-19 crisis. As the Taskforce surely understands -- and as the Bureau itself has recognized in extending the deadline for responding to other Notices -- the COVID-19 crisis has compelled individuals and organizations to spring to action to address various pressing matters, all while simultaneously navigating work and family circumstances that have changed drastically in a short period of time. Since the questions the Taskforce asks implicate long-standing policy challenges that will shape consumer protections for years to come, we believe that, at a minimum, an extended comment period was warranted to ensure engagement with a range of differing perspectives. Indeed, given the importance of the questions the Taskforce has posed, we think that the Taskforce's engagement with stakeholders should go well beyond seeking written responses to an RFI.</p><p>Measuring Financial Health Outcomes</p><p>In order to answer the questions posed by the Taskforce, we will start at the end, and we believe the Taskforce should do likewise. That is, the Taskforce should pay close attention to the measurement of consumers' financial health or financial well-being outcomes as it seeks to determine the efficacy of consumer protection. The end goal of consumer protection in financial services should be to promote day-to-day financial systems that enable financial health, and measuring our success in achieving that is the best way to assess the efficacy of consumer financial protection.</p><p>With that in mind, the evidence seems to tell us that there is a great deal of work to do. The CFPB has defined financial well-being in terms of an individual's ability to \"meet current and ongoing financial obligations,\" \"feel secure in their financial future,\" and \"make choices that allow enjoyment of life.\"/1</p><p>Yet when the Bureau conducted a national survey of consumers in 2016, it found that about one-third of all adults did not meet even the first element of financial well-being. These consumers' scores on the CFPB's well-being scale indicated a high probability of struggling to make ends meet and of experiencing material hardship./2</p><p>For the past three years, the Financial Health Network has conducted an annual financial health survey.</p><p>According to the 2019 U.S. Financial Health Pulse, only 29 percent of Americans were \"financially healthy,\" which we define in a manner consistent with the CFPB definition of financial well-being.</p><p>Moreover, longitudinal data tell us that over a two-year period, almost one in four families fell into the group that we classify as \"financially vulnerable\" at one time or another. This means that they were struggling with all, or nearly all, aspects of their financial lives./3</p><p>These trends would be troubling to observe at any time, but the fact that they were observed during the last two years of the longest economic expansion in American history should give pause to any observer committed to financial health. Today, Americans' already precarious financial lives are being strained even further by the COVID-19 crisis, which has precipitated the highest levels of unemployment since World War II.</p><p>There are, of course, numerous underlying factors contributing to the precarious state of Americans' financial lives. Many of these factors, such as stagnant wages and the rising costs of healthcare and education, are outside the scope of consumer financial protection broadly and the CFPB in particular.</p><p>However, markets for consumer financial products have a critical role to play in supporting consumers' financial health. Our definition of financial health states that, \"financial health comes about when a consumer's day-to-day financial systems enable them to build resilience and pursue opportunities.\" The CFPB has a responsibility to ensure that consumer financial protections create an environment for consumers' day-to-day financial systems to function accordingly.</p><p>To help meet this responsibility, we believe the CFPB should establish an ongoing program to monitor financial health in the United States and to develop metrics that can be used to measure financial health outcomes attributable to particular financial services products or relationships. Indeed, we believe that financial services providers should be encouraged -- if not required -- to measure and monitor the financial health of their customers and the impact that the providers' activities are having on financial health. At a minimum, such measurement should be a necessary element of any No Action Letters, Approvals, Trial Disclosure Waivers, or similar actions by the Bureau to facilitate consumer-friendly innovation.</p><p>Markets for Consumer Financial Products</p><p>Against this background, we will briefly discuss the Taskforce's question about which markets function well and which do not. Specifically, we will address the markets for credit, payments, and deposits.</p><p>Credit</p><p>Credit has played a critical role in the financial lives of American consumers since at least the 1920s.</p><p>Indeed, the ability to finance large purchases has proven critical to raising Americans' standard of living, and has been foundational to the creation of the middle class./4</p><p>However, consumers' ability to repay a loan is a fundamental principle of credit that has often been ignored. According to the Pulse, almost 30 percent of Americans have more debt than they can manage, and almost 25 percent say that their debt burden is delaying or preventing their being able to save for retirement. Put another way, credit can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to consumer financial health.</p><p>Credit cards can be particularly dangerous in this regard. While their original purpose was to provide a convenient means for consumers to make purchases without having to carry lots of cash, credit cards have evolved into much more than that. Today, credit cards are a vehicle by which many consumers finance relatively small purchases and then revolve their balance from month to month for years at a time. All too frequently these consumers pay just the minimum payment, which typically pays down only one percent of the outstanding balance./5</p><p>While this behavior is clearly detrimental to financial health, credit card issuers have every incentive to encourage it, since finance charges are their principal source of revenue. Indeed, research on credit card utilization from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is illustrative of this, and shows how credit limits and credit line increases -- which issuers can offer proactively absent any consumer request -- shape how much consumers borrow, even when consumers were not close to hitting their limit./6</p><p>This results in a sustained debt burden for more than half of credit card users as they revolve their debt from one month to the next. According to the 2019 Pulse, the median American household with credit card debt had $5,000 in outstanding credit card balances carried over from previous months. To put that in context, households had a median of $2,700 in liquid savings in 2019. To put it mildly, it is a daunting challenge for many consumers to repay such debts along with the mortgage, auto, medical, and student loan debt burdens they already carry. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom has developed a regulatory response to the issue of \"persistent debt\" which merits the Taskforce's careful review./7</p><p>Even more than more traditional, mainstream consumer credit, small-dollar credit products can pose substantial risks to consumers, and need to be carefully regulated. To start with, there is a tendency to conflate the need for small-dollar credit with the need for short-term credit. While short-term credit may be useful for some consumers facing a temporary, misaligned cash flow (i.e. a bill that falls due before the next payday), consumers facing a financial shock may not be able to manage a short-term credit product designed for rapid repayment.</p><p>Nevertheless, the demand for small-dollar credit is clear. The 2019 Pulse found that three percent of households, more than 3.5 million, had taken out a payday loan in the preceding 12 months. While this may come as a surprise to the financially healthy, it demonstrates the precarious economic reality faced by many American families. The Financial Health Pulse found that 26 percent of households could not cover more than three weeks of expenses out of their current savings, and that 11 percent would not even be able to cover one week. This savings crisis is particularly sobering in the context of COVID-19, and indicates a potential need for well-structured small-dollar credit products to serve as a backup.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the small-dollar credit products currently offered (such as payday loans) are not structured with the borrowers' best interests in mind, and have gone so far as to take advantage of borrowers who are perennially behind on their bills by forgoing any consideration of the borrower's ability to repay. Far from supporting consumers' financial health, such products can lure consumers into debt traps that are difficult to escape and exacerbate pre-existing financial health maladies. The Financial Health Network's research has found that there are three primary needs that drive consumers to obtain small-dollar credit products; misaligned cash flow, unexpected expenses, and expenses that consistently exceed income./8</p><p>Of these three, it is likely that borrowers in the last group would not see their financial health improved by adding more debt to their plate, and that borrowers in the second group are not well served by products that require rapid repayment unrelated to the time needed to recover from the financial shock. For this reason, we have supported the CFPB's efforts to require providers of small-dollar credit to make a reasonable assessment of borrowers' ability to repay without the need to reborrow.</p><p>However, the Financial Health Network has also encouraged policymakers to allow financial institutions to experiment with the price and terms of repayments for small-dollar loans, even above the common usury limit of 36 percent annual percentage rate (APR)./9</p><p>While APR can be a useful tool for comparing many kinds of credit products, its utility diminishes as the number of days in a loan's term approaches zero. Some states have pioneered new kinds of price regulation that may be more useful for short term loans. These regulations cap the total cost of the loan at a percentage of the principal and spread the cost over the term of the loan to reward borrowers who repay early and avoid creating incentives for lenders to refinance loans.</p><p>Beyond cost, there is also a need to ensure that short-term and small-dollar credit is structured to encourage manageable repayment for borrowers. An initial determination of ability to repay is key.</p><p>That determination must include consideration not only of the repayment terms, but must also take borrowers' other obligations into consideration to ensure that borrowers can meet all their fixed obligations and still have enough left to cover their basic living expenses.</p><p>Payments</p><p>As discussed above, one of the primary factors driving the need for small-dollar credit is misaligned cash flow. For the large share of workers who are paid bi-weekly and for others who are paid irregularly, the fact of the matter is that payday falls on different days every month. Even when payday arrives, workers must wait for a few more days to access their funds as their paycheck is processed and cleared through our antiquated payments system. While this lag may be insignificant for more affluent consumers, it can cause substantial cash flow misalignment challenges for families living paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>To mitigate these issues, the Financial Health Network has both encouraged the development of innovative products that give consumers timely access to their wages, and supported the establishment of a faster payments system. In today's economy, an hourly worker paid bi-weekly gives her employer an interest-free loan for more than two weeks before her own paycheck arrives. While this float is certainly appreciated by the employer, it comes at a real cost to the worker providing the loan. Some firms have already begun to offer products that give workers timely access to their wages (sometimes called \"early wage access\" or \"pay on demand\"), albeit at a cost to workers. While their impact is yet to be determined, we believe that further experimentation is warranted in order to lessen consumers' reliance on high cost credit, check cashing, and overdraft. Reduced demand for these products would signal a substantial improvement to consumers' financial health, and should be welcomed by regulators seeking to ensure that the market for consumer financial products is functioning optimally.</p><p>The Taskforce may also wish to examine and provide clarity on the applicability of laws regulating the extension of credit to certain types of programs which enable employees to obtain their wages as earned.</p><p>However, innovative early wage access models cannot solve the misaligned cash flow problem on their own. As the Taskforce alludes to in its questions, a large share of responsibility lies with shamefully slow clearance times that exist in the payments system in the United States. It can take up to three business days for a paycheck to clear and be accessible to consumers, and may take close to a week if it falls over a weekend or holiday./10</p><p>During this time, consumers still need to pay bills, fill up their gas tank, and put food on the table for their families. With this in mind, the Financial Health Network has advocated for the Federal Reserve to move with all haste to establish a faster payments system./11</p><p>We are also supportive of private sector innovation to enable faster payments, and believe that consumers would be well served by legislative action directing the Federal Reserve to mandate real-time fund availability while the Fed is in the process of setting up its recently announced FedNow system. Such a mandate would necessarily lean on private sector mechanisms such as The Clearing House's RTP system in the short term, and would incentivize the Federal Reserve to move quickly to set up its own system, which we believe to be a critical piece of financial health infrastructure.</p><p>The Taskforce also asks whether it is necessary to tie transaction services to the banking system, and whether allowing the two to exist independently may introduce new risks to consumers. We believe that it could introduce new risks, as many consumer protections related to transactions are tied to the banking system. Further, allowing payments to migrate away from the banking system and towards large technology firms, for example, may introduce new considerations for prudential regulators, not to mention considerations for competition policy and data governance./12</p><p>In China, where such a migration has already occurred, the central bank stepped in ex-post to require technology firms to link their popular payments applications to traditional bank accounts, and to keep 100 percent of the float in reserve at the central bank. Interestingly, this regulatory outcome echoes a proposal to give consumers in the United States accounts at the Federal Reserve through traditional financial institutions. As this proposal and others are fleshed out more fully, it will be critical for the Taskforce to remain on the lookout for consumer protection risks. In any event, the COVID-19 crisis has strengthened the case for building out the missing last mile of financial health infrastructure between the government and consumers, either through the banking system or otherwise.</p><p>Deposits</p><p>With the inadequacy of our financial health infrastructure in mind, the Taskforce is right to note that millions of U.S. households continue to lack bank accounts, and ask whether the Bureau should promote greater access to banking services. We believe that first, the Bureau must promote a market for deposits that maximizes financial health rather than maximizing fees charged to consumers. In particular, the Bureau should take a hard look at the incentives created by the free checking account model./13</p><p>Along with other factors, the normalization of free checking has meant that banks need to rely more heavily on back-end, penalty fee income to remain profitable. While this model has served many banks quite well, it does not promote consumers' financial health. For example, costly overdraft fees (usually around $35 dollars) are disproportionately borne by financially vulnerable frequent overdrafters, as the Bureau's own research has shown./14</p><p>Adding insult to injury, the price of these fees bears no resemblance to the marginal cost incurred by the bank for providing the \"service\" of overdraft.</p><p>This was true before the Federal Reserve Board adopted its opt-in rule/15 and remains true today. Indeed, the opt-in rule has created a new set of inequities since many overdrafts result from transactions in which debits are authorized when a consumer appears (both to the bank and to the customer) to have sufficient funds, but does not at the time of settlement. In these instances those consumers who have not opted-in receive overdraft coverage for free (since the bank cannot opt-out of its commitment at authorization to pay the merchant) whereas consumers who have opted-in are charged for these very same transactions.</p><p>Moreover, consumers often incur overdraft fees for transactions that, at the time of authorization, were well within their available balance. Unfortunately, reining in these practices is not something the market can do on its own. It took a series of class action lawsuits to put an end to what had become an industry-standard practice of processing process debits from largest to smallest in amount, thereby maximizing the number of overdraft transactions. Even today, many banks assess overdraft fees based on the available balance (after taking into account previously-authorized debits) at time of settlement.</p><p>This can result in overdraft fees being charged on two transactions when the consumer had enough money in the account to cover one of the transactions -- a practice that warrants regulatory attention./16</p><p>Economic research has shown that the competitive dynamics of the market for deposits will not incent banks to compete on the basis of overdraft fees and practices, as it is more profitable to compete on up-front fees, which are more salient to consumers, and exploit existing information asymmetries and consumer vulnerabilities./17</p><p>Many financially vulnerable and coping consumers have grown wise to the fact that this system is rigged against them, and have adopted alternatives to bank accounts such as prepaid cards. In 2018, prepaid card payments accounted for 10.5 percent of all card payments./18</p><p>Even before the adoption of the CFPB's prepaid card rule, most prepaid cards did not allow their users to overdraft, a useful limitation for financially vulnerable consumers living close to the edge. As a result of the rule, that is now universally true. However, prepaid cards can be costly to reload for consumers who cannot arrange for direct deposits. They may also offer less functionality than traditional checking accounts as a means of paying bills. Thus, we do not believe that prepaid cards should be viewed as a complete substitute for safe checking accounts.</p><p>The Taskforce also notes the emergence of digital wallets used for peer-to-peer electronic payments, but these are best understood as complementary to bank accounts rather than as alternatives to them.</p><p>Unlike prepaid cards, these digital wallets must be linked to a bank account or card and cannot be reloaded with cash. For this reason, peer-to-peer digital wallets are insufficient replacements for bank accounts as they are currently structured.</p><p>Promoting Competition</p><p>As discussed above, the market often fails to incentivize banks to foster their customers' financial health. This is due to a number of market imperfections, such as high switching costs and information asymmetries. Starting with the former, the time and money required to switch to a bank that offers better pricing or service on a checking account is beyond what is reasonable for many consumers. As discussed above, these consumers' substantial liquidity constraints are simply too great to allow them to adequately fund two accounts while they switch over their direct deposits and auto-debit arrangements. Even if they do have the cash required, the time needed to make these changes is likely a substantial cause of inertia that prevents consumers from switching. As such, banks have little reason to fear that their consumers will leave them for a competitor with lower fees or better service.</p><p>Asymmetric information can also be a barrier to financial health-enabling competition, as the search costs for consumers to comparison shop are prohibitive for many products. In the overdraft example, the amount consumers end up paying is a function of a myriad of bank policies that consumers are unlikely to be aware of or understand before they choose their bank. Indeed, they are unlikely to understand them even if hit with multiple overdrafts. When critical information is this opaque, opportunities to exploit consumers rather than compete to serve them abound.</p><p>These phenomena are not unique to the United States. Policymakers in the United Kingdom have been working to increase competition in retail banking for some time. There, regulators have undertaken significant efforts to enable both account portability and data portability to mitigate high switching costs and information asymmetries. In order to enable account portability, the UK built a \"Current Account Switching Service\" (CASS) to help consumers switch their account to providers with lower fees or better service./19</p><p>While this seems to have lowered switching costs, consumer uptake has been limited./20</p><p>However, some argue that the CASS doesn't go far enough, and that true account number portability is needed. If the experience with telephone number portability is any guide, such a system could greatly increase competition in retail banking for the benefit of consumers./21</p><p>While conversations of account portability in banking have languished in obscurity, data portability has become one of the hottest topics in the industry. Since 2014, regulators in the UK have been working towards an \"Open Banking\" system, whereby financial institutions are mandated to allow their customers to share their data with licensed third parties./22</p><p>Similarly, regulators in the European Union (EU) have been implementing the EU's Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)./23</p><p>While PSD2's scope is more limited, both PSD2 and Open Banking mandate the creation of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that allow third parties to securely access consumer data. These initiatives also have a shared aim of increasing competition by enabling comparison shopping and lowering barriers to entry for innovative firms. Indeed, access to data has proven to be critical for much of the innovation we have seen in the fintech ecosystem.</p><p>Consumer Data &amp; Consumer Protection</p><p>In the United States, the debate over consumer financial data has been characterized by far less regulatory engagement. Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act states that:</p><p>\"Subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau, a covered person shall make available to a consumer, upon request, information in the control or possession of such person concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from such covered person, including information related to any transaction, or series of transactions, to the account including costs, charges, and usage data.\"/24</p><p>In the ten years since Dodd-Frank, the meaning of this passage has been increasingly hotly debated.</p><p>The Financial Health Network has long believed that an inclusive and secure financial data ecosystem is one in which financial institutions, data aggregators and third-party application providers coordinate to provide data to consumers that are available, reliable, user-permissioned, secure, and limited to application functionality./25</p><p>The Bureau echoed many of these principles in its own non-binding principles from 2017, but we believe the time has come for the Bureau to undertake a formal rulemaking process under Section 1033. We discussed our views on this issue at length in our written statement to the CFPB prior to its recent Symposium on consumer access to financial records./26</p><p>While there were many important points raised at the Symposium, we would highlight two particular takeaways. First, we believe the discussion about the kinds of information that financial institutions regard as proprietary highlighted the need for rulemaking on Section 1033 to clarify consumers' right to their own data as a means to facilitate competition. For example, while there are certainly proprietary data fields that financial institutions should not be compelled to share, we do not believe that pricing is one of them, as has been suggested by some. Rather, we believe that transparent pricing is key to facilitating competition. Second, it was notable that the vast majority of the diverse panelists at the Symposium agreed about the need for rulemaking, despite their disagreement on the content of such rulemaking./27</p><p>In addition to the need for rulemaking on Section 1033, the emergence of new third-party applications and data aggregators raises a number of other consumer protection questions that must be addressed.</p><p>We discuss these in some detail in our written submission to the CFPB Symposium, but will briefly address them here as well in response to the Taskforce's questions.</p><p>First, given that today's financial data ecosystem continues to rely on data sharing through screen scraping using consumers' log-in credentials, there is an outstanding question about who is liable for an unauthorized transaction resulting from credentials shared with a data aggregator. From a consumer protection standpoint, we believe that the worst possible resolution of this question would be for consumers to be held liable for a transaction executed through no fault of their own. As such, we believe that the CFPB should issue guidance that consumers are not liable for unauthorized transactions originated with login credentials a consumer has shared with a data aggregator./28</p><p>Such guidance may help to motivate industry to come to an agreed-upon liability framework. In order to ensure that a future breach does not jeopardize the solvency of data aggregators or third party application providers, we believe that the CFPB should also encourage appropriate risk mitigation policies, including third-party liability insurance.</p><p>Second, there is a need to clarify the supervision of data aggregators. While recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gives insight into one regulator's view of how aggregators should be treated by financial institutions with respect to third party risk management, we continue to believe that interagency guidance is needed to ensure that aggregators are sufficiently supervised. Following such guidance, the CFPB should strongly consider whether bringing aggregators under direct supervision via larger participant rulemaking is necessary or appropriate.</p><p>Third, and perhaps most relevant to the Taskforce's questions, there is a need to clarify the applicability of the Fair Credit Reporting Act when data aggregators supply data at a consumer's request for use in lending or other FCRA-covered decisions. If some or all aggregators are deemed to be consumer reporting agencies under FCRA based upon the activities of the aggregators, there also would be a need to clarify whether banks are furnishers. If aggregators were not found to be consumer reporting agencies or if their sources of data were not found to be furnishers, there would be an open question about how the accuracy of the data obtained by aggregators and used by lenders in making credit decisions can be assured absent the rights and protections afforded by FCRA. In that case, the Bureau should be mindful of the fact that accuracy can be affected by the means through which data is collected (there is more risk of error when data is collected through screen scraping than from an API), as well as by the source of the data (data derived from a system of record used to manage accounts on a day-to-day basis may raise fewer accuracy concerns than other sources). Consideration may be given to affording consumers the right to see a preview of their data before it is shared by an aggregator with, for example, a creditor. However, this approach would necessitate the need to take great care that consumers do not bear an inordinate burden to ensure accuracy, and that aggregators are correctly incentivized to use whatever data collection and transmission mechanisms ensure the greatest accuracy for consumers.</p><p>More broadly, the Taskforce has asked whether or not FCRA and Regulation V sufficiently fulfill their core purpose of ensuring accuracy. We believe that FCRA's core obligation on consumer reporting agencies to take reasonable steps to assure maximum possible accuracy is, at best, opaque. The Federal Trade Commission's seminal accuracy study found that a substantial share of consumer reports contained material errors./29</p><p>Moreover, the Bureau's reports on its supervisory activities involving consumer reporting agencies suggest that those agencies have under-invested both in efforts to ensure accuracy and in the infrastructure needed to identify and correct errors and respond to consumer disputes./30</p><p>With these findings in mind, we believe this is an area ripe for further regulatory oversight. Finally, the Taskforce asks about the sufficiency of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and Regulation P, and whether they sufficiently protect consumers' personal information. The Financial Health Network believes that there is substantial room for improvement here, and that broader conversations about the need for national data privacy laws too often leave out the need to update consumer data rights and protections in banking, healthcare, education, and other sectors that already have data privacy laws. For example, we do not believe that the opt-out mechanism required by GLBA is a good model for the future. At the very least, we believe that bank-initiated data sharing should be governed by an opt-in regime, with a default assumption that customers do not have any particular desire for their financial data to be sold to, rented to, or otherwise used by other third parties as they see fit.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In this letter, we have described several gaps in consumer financial protections. The Financial Health Network believes that addressing these issues is necessary to improve financial health outcomes and to ensure that the CFPB's mission of protecting consumers is successful. However, this list is far from exhaustive. It will remain critical for the Taskforce to proactively identify conditions that justify regulation in the market for consumer financial products and services. In order to do so, we recommend following a framework envisioned by a thoughtful group of experts at the creation of the CFPB. This group recommended that the Bureau consider market intervention in cases where there are negative externalities, information failures, market power, public goods, cognitive biases, limited financial capabilities, and unfair outcomes to be found./31</p><p>These elements are present in the markets for credit, payments, and deposits, but are also likely to be found in other areas within the Bureau's purview. Should the Taskforce have doubts about the need to intervene in these cases, we believe that following the evidence presented by financial health outcomes can help them to prioritize which areas need the most immediate attention. Until all consumers' day-to-day financial systems truly enable them to build resilience and pursue opportunities, the CFPB will have no shortage of work to do.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Dan Murphy</p><p>Policy Manager</p><p>Financial Health Network</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1/ Measuring financial well-being: A guide to using the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2017</p><p>2/ Financial well-being in America; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; 2017</p><p>3/ U.S. Financial Health Pulse: 2019 Trends Report; Financial Health Network; 2019</p><p>4/ Borrow: The American Way of Debt; Hyman; 2012</p><p>5/ Minimum Payments and Debt Paydown in Consumer Credit Cards; Keys and Wang; National Bureau of Economic Research; 2016</p><p>6/ Credit Card Utilization and Consumption over the Life Cycle and Business Cycle; Fulford and Schuh; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; 2017</p><p>7/ Credit card Market Study: Persistent Debt and Earlier Intervention; Financial Conduct Authority; 2018</p><p>8/ Know Your Borrower: The Four Need Cases of Small Dollar Credit Consumers; Bianchi and Levy; Financial Health Network; 2013</p><p>9/ Testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services Sub-Committee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions: Hearing on Ending Debt Traps in the Payday and Small Dollar Credit Industry; Reeder; Financial Health Network; 2019</p><p>10/ Comment Letter on Potential Federal Reserve Actions to Support Interbank Settlement of Faster Payments; Klein, Brookings, 2018.</p><p>11/ Go Slow On Libra.

For unauthorized transactions made by the aggregator itself, there is a further complication stemming from Regulation E's treatment of consumer liability in cases where the consumer shares an \"access device\", but the authority to use that device is exceeded by the person with whom the consumer has shared it. This exception to consumers' liability protection under Regulation E was designed with debit cards in mind, which may commonly be shared by family members or close friends. However, in the data aggregation context, it creates ambiguity in cases where an aggregator exceeds the consumers' intent by making an unauthorized transaction. Further clarity would also be helpful in this area so that all parties can be made aware of how liability will be assigned.</p><p>29/ In FTC Study, Five Percent of Consumers Had Errors on Their Credit Reports That Could Result in Less Favorable Terms for Loans; Federal Trade Commission, 2013.</p><p>30/ Supervisory Highlights Consumer Reporting Special Edition; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2019.</p><p>31/ Making Financial Markets Work for Consumers; Campbell, Jackson, Madrian, &amp; Tufano; Harvard Business Review; 2011</p><p>* * *</p><p>The notice can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://beta.regulations.gov/document/CFPB-2020-0013-0001\">https://beta.regulations.gov/document/CFPB-2020-0013-0001</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Forget about ever really doing it, we  can't even fake doing it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everyone.  Glad to have you.  I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And talk about a \"House of Cards\", literally, because the fictional  president on that fictional NetFlix show takes a fictional stab at  entitlement spending and liberal blogs are going seriously nuts.  But even  more seriously nuts when I bring up the ridiculous reaction to this utterly  ridiculous, totally made-up issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP - \"YOUR WORLD\", YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The Huffington Post detailing how Underwood's goal of zero  unemployment is impossible and that even if he did get there, inflation  would get out of control everywhere.  </p><p>This tell you all you need to know, that even cutting entitlements on a  fake show with a fake president gets this type of real irate response.   This is Rome in the final days.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP - \"YOUR WORLD\", YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, you can almost guess what happens next - angry Liberals  jumping on moi for them jumping on this.  </p><p>This headline on a very popular media website summed it up.  \"Fox's Cavuto  Proudly Stands with the President (No, Not Obama)\".  The writer goes on to  explain that I was seriously rushing to a fake President Underwood's  defense.</p><p>Newsflash!  I wasn't rushing to anyone's defense, just wondering why so  many were taking offense over something that wasn't real and a President  and a whole storyline that are totally made-up.  It didn't matter.  I was  just seriously evil.  </p><p>I want you to take a look at just some of the responses.</p><p>Like this one: \"Figures Cavuto loves Frank Underwood more than Barack  Obama...\"</p><p>Then this: \"Fake President for a fake news channel.\"</p><p>This one I personally like: \"Pravda and Tass are models for Fox News.\"</p><p>And then this one: \"Cavuto's a troll and a midget ogre.\"  I have no idea  what that means.     </p><p>\"Obviously, Cavuto's OK letting our poor suffer.  He makes Underwood look  like Lincoln.\" </p><p>Then this: \"What a heartless bastard this fat Fox fake is... all for  cutting entitlements any way he can.\"  Who are you calling \"fat\"?</p><p>Anyway, \"Most people are aware that Repubs suffer Schizophrenia..\", I  forgot, \"..mixed with racism...\", I forgot that too, \"...it's a dangerous  combo.\"</p><p>Then this: \"Underwood's cut to entitlements fund a $500 billion stimulus  program.  Cavuto didn't mention that.\"  </p><p>Well, actually, I did mention that but who needs facts on something that's  fake and thank God for at least some viewers who did know what I was  getting at.</p><p>Like this guy: \"This headline is so deceptive.  The Fox host was ranting  about a fictional character being taken seriously by left-wing websites and  somehow he is defending him?  This website is growing worse day by day.\" </p><p>Now, there were a lot of other emails like that last one.  In fact, most  emails were like that last one.  But my point here wasn't to make me look  good.  I don't have to.  </p><p>Anyway, my other point though was to quite seriously take a look at how  difficult it is to ever get a handle on real entitlement reform because  even when we're discussing a fake show, my God, we can't even fake it.  And  if that's the case, we really are a financial 'House of Cards'.</p><p>To political watcher Steve Moore, Sabrina Schaeffer, Julie Roginsky.</p><p>Steve, what do you think?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Well, Neil, it is a  (INAUDIBLE) fake character and it is a fake show.  But you know what?  It's  not a fake crisis.  This entitlement time bomb that is (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're feeding the beast, Moore.  You're feeding the beast.</p><p>MOORE:  Well, you had it exactly right.  This is a real crisis.  Ten  thousand Americans are retiring every day.  They're going on Medicare.   They're going on social security.  This is the Titanic headed right towards  the iceberg.  And shame on you for saying maybe we should start turning  that ship away from the iceberg.  But you're right on.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But here's the thing, Sabrina.  I mean, even when a fake show lobs  this up, silly as it was, it gets this type of reaction.  People are  seriously all worked-up about it.  So Sabrina, my worry with this is if we  can't even get to it on a fake entitlement address, how are we ever going  to get serious about it?</p><p>SABRINA SCHAEFFER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Well, here's the thing,  Neil, and this is where the writers got Frank Underwood totally wrong.   Democrats would never have released something like Frank Underwood does on  this AmWorks program without intensive persuasion messaging research.   Frank Underwood would never have just talked about entitlement reform the  way he did in that meeting in that scene in the show.  In fact, the  Independent Women's Forum did conduct a randomized controlled experiment to  figure out how do we talk about it and talking about entitlement reform is  not the sort of bomb that we're thinking it is.  In fact, when you talk  about cutting spending or to preserve entitlements, Americans are strongly  behind it.  They're strongly behind constraining our budget and as well as  reforming entitlements and that's good news.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  My worry with this, Julie, is that we take at face  value that anything that comes up there (INAUDIBLE) by that definition, on  a fake show, in \"Planet of the Apes\".  I guess the subliminal messages -  we're not careful, this is us in just a few decades.  I mean, we've got to  get serious.</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC PARTY STRATEGIST:  You know why I'm so mad at  you and your producers right now?  I was sitting in my office minding my  own business.  They sent me this clip and they said, \"Do you want to do the  show today?\" and you totally ruined the \"House of Cards\" for me.  I was  going to spend this weekend watching it and then you spoiled the whole  thing.  So--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I didn't give away how he - how he addresses this.  I just--</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I don't want to talk about it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  --told you what one episode is about.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I have made people keep their mouths shut for a week and you  ruined my day.  Thank you very much.  Look, I actually agree with you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know it's fiction because it's a Democrats' series about a  budget so you know it's fiction.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yes.  I forgot the last Democrat that actually gave us a  balanced - oh, OK.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Touche, young lady.  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yes, yes.  Touche.  His name was (INAUDIBLE).  His name - his  name was Bill Clinton, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But even you, Julie - Julie, come on.  Julie, even you - and I  think Bill Clinton would take offense to everyone getting hyper about it.  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  I agree.  Actually, I agree with you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You agree, right?</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Totally.  This is insane.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  So Steve, she agrees.  Democrats and Repubs are on the  same page: \"Everyone, lighten up.\"  What say you?</p><p>MOORE:  Well, look, first of all, I didn't even know Underwood was  President so that's how far behind I am on this stuff.  But - so thanks a  lot.  No, but look, here's the point.  We know this.  We have tens of  trillions - that's trillions with a \"T\" - of unfunded liabilities in these  programs.  If we don't fix them, Neil, whether it's fictionally or in real  life, we're going to end up - this country's going to end up like Detroit,  in bankruptcy court.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But even mentioning them on a fictitious show and what worries me- -.</p><p>MOORE:  Well, that's the whole point.</p><p>SCHAEFFER:  But again, you know--.</p><p>MOORE:  But you know, Millennials like - Millennials do want to fix these  programs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I agree.  I agree.  But I should (INAUDIBLE) to our audience that  in \"Dr. DoLittle\", the animals do not really talk.  I just want them to be  aware of that.  They do not really talk.  Although some of them I think  could if pushed.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I also don't think the President's killed two people with his  own hands in the history of this country but I may be wrong about that.   Frank Underwood's done a lot worse than (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know about that.  I don't know about that.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I don't think he's pushed anybody from the D.C. metro anytime  but I may be wrong about that.</p><p>SCHAEFFER:  Let me add though that I don't think this is a political  disaster either.  I think that - I hope that people will take a look at the  research that we did on this issue because it's not a lose-lose.  It's a -  there's a win politically and there's a win policy-wise.  We have to deal  with this issue because the pay-as-you-go system as Steve acknowledges is  no longer working and--.  But I think Americans are more behind reforming  this.  It's a matter of how do we talk about it in a way that makes people  comfortable, it makes people realize that we're actually trying to preserve  these systems for the future.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well-said. </p><p>Guys, I want to thank you all.  One other footnote to make - a lot of you  who were confused whether the Linda Blair character in \"Exorcist\" was built  on Nancy Pelosi.  That one, you're right.  That was in fact, the case.  </p><p>Just lighten up, everyone.  Lighten up.</p><p>Meanwhile, fake or real, it really doesn't matter because if these ladies  are right, no one is serious about government spending at all, least of  all, get this, Republicans.</p><p>To columnist Gina Loudon, Katherine Timf who say perish the thought.</p><p>What - Gina, what's going on here?  Republicans are giving up the fight?</p><p>GINA LOUDON, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST:  This is my question I really want to  know how to answer.  I speak around probably like you do to audiences of  true patriots who elected this leadership and put them where they are and  they are expecting some accountability.  This is really what it comes down  to.  How do you answer the question?  If Boehner was going to cave on this,  Neil, why didn't he cave a week ago, just before that?  Why didn't he - why  did he wait until it was truly a war--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So you're angry (INAUDIBLE) dropped the ball again?  'Cause he did  try their idea first and it fell through, right, (INAUDIBLE) the votes.</p><p>LOUDON:  But when you - when you pit yourself against someone who you say,  \"This is a fight\", and you lay down--.  Let me ask you something.  When's  the last time they didn't lay down?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I ask the questions around here, lady.  What do you think this is?   NetFlix?  </p><p>LOUDON:  When is the last time they didn't lay down?  When is the last time  you ever saw Boehner actually win a fight?  When?  I've never seen it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, now, Katherine, she's (INAUDIBLE) because whether you agree  or disagree, there are quite a few like her who are not copacetic with the  mainstream party and how it handles this stuff.</p><p>KATHERINE TIMPF, NATIONAL REVIEW COLUMNIST:  Right.  If you look at what he  said towards the beginning, just like you said, he came out saying, \"Watch  out, Obama.  You can't do this\" and he can't.  He actually can't.  The  executive order on the immigration--</p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, so did President Underwood.  You know where that--.</p><p>TIMPF:  --not able to do that.  But the thing is even on a branding level,  they're not doing a great job because right now, the Democrats are saying,  \"See how far the Republicans were willing to go because of how racist they  are and they hate this immigration law.\"  When really, it was about the  fact that it's not constitutional.  So there are so many issues here.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, wait, I got no emails on that - that Republicans are racist- -.</p><p>TIMPF:  If you look at liberal internet, they're saying, \"See, they're so  racist.  They would let terrorists invade us and defunding the DHS\" which,  by the way, this is the only time I've ever heard them concerned about ISIS  at all now that it's political.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All of a sudden, they're concerned.  </p><p>LOUDON:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Gina, I mean, your argument is we've got to be very close to  understanding the threats that faces financial otherwise, and that  Republicans have to be looking at that in their nominee whoever that is.   If it were a Jeb Bush, if it were a Chris Christie, what would Gina Loudon  do?</p><p>LOUDON:  Well, I'll tell you, this administration has put us all in a  mindset of we've got to have someone who isn't Barack Obama and certainly  isn't Hillary or any of the selections that we're seeing come out of their  camp.  So we do - people in this country are worried about economic  security and national security.  That is number one on their mind that's  paramount to the voters and that's not just conservatives.  That is across  the board when you talk (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But you don't like the guys I mentioned earlier?</p><p>LOUDON:  I'm not - those aren't my number one choices.  No.  But I will say  this - why instead - what has got to happen from the GOP and I still don't  understand it is messaging, messaging, messaging and you alluded to this.   You - why - instead of laying down again - didn't they just get on the  messaging horse and just win this?  The argument was so very simple and  understandable for the average American and instead, they just kind of  cower.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Here's where I give them the benefit of the doubt.  No, no.   Here's where - I understand what you're saying but Katherine, they have to  get through the mainstream media that will never cut them a break, that  will call them - as you say - \"racist\", (INAUDIBLE) \"You're going to shut  down government\" when we know in that case, that was never what this was  going to be about.  But they have to get through that.  How do they?</p><p>TIMPF:  They really do.  Well, maybe they need to think about it before  they go blazing saddles out with something like this.  I don't know why  they chose the DHS.</p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, blazing saddles was not a real (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Yes.  Wait, what?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Was not a real event.</p><p>TIMPF:  I have so many political opinions about it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The budget might be blazing but I digress.</p><p>TIMPF:  But they came out and they weren't prepared to fight it to the end.   And I don't know why they chose the DHS, like I was saying, rather than  Department of Education.  Of course DHS' mostly agencies that actually  fight terrorism aren't even under that umbrella necessarily--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But that was interesting.  Then all of a sudden, they were - the  Democrats were concerned about terror.</p><p>TIMPF:  All of a sudden, they're saying, \"(INAUDIBLE) the DHS.  But ISIS is  going to invade us immediately if we even partially defund it.\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  But Republicans dug themselves in that pit, didn't they?</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>LOUDON:  So all they had to say was \"Look, this is 15 percent of employees  who have mostly desk jobs.\"  So somebody not playing Solitaire at their  desk next week is not going affect Homeland Security.  Let's be real about  this.</p><p>CAVUTO:  They're not all playing Solitaire.  Some of them are on porn.   Now, so, what do Republicans do right now?  What's done is done, what's  gone is gone?</p><p>TIMPF:  It's humiliating.  They need to find something that they all agree  on and stand behind that and do it.  'Cause right now, they had this  majority and it doesn't even matter because they can't agree on anything,  it seems like.  So they need to prove that they're powerful and not just  reactive to everything.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Gina?</p><p>LOUDON:  I agree.  They've got to stand.  The Republicans have better -  look at Reagan.  He just stood and he convinced the country he was right.   That's leadership.  Look at (INAUDIBLE).  He stands.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But he also budged on - he raised taxes in 1986.  They were still  lower than they were when he took office but he was good at negotiating.</p><p>LOUDON:  He was big at leading.  People need a leader in this country.  We  are - we are looking at all the threats - North Korea, of course, Iran, so  on and so forth, and we're watching as other leaders around the country  lead and the leaders in this country including the Republican leaders right  now are refusing to lead.  They're making commitments.  They're making  strong stands.  And then they're backing down or they're just cowering to  start.  It's a very scary place to be right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So you're saying that a guy who started as an actor in movies was  in fact a real leader?</p><p>LOUDON:  He was in fact a real leader.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Take that, Underwood.  </p><p>LOUDON:  That brings it full circle.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I know we're going to get emails on this show.  People, lighten  up!</p><p>All right.  In the meantime, the IRS is singing the budget blues.  Now, who  exactly is singing yours?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Talk about taxing and the IRS complaining.  Now, well, you've  already heard how the agency's been whining about budget cuts that has  supposedly compromised its ability to audit you.  But now, the Treasury's  chiming in to say those same cuts are going to create even more headaches  for you.  They might not be able to get refunds out as fast or administer  the financial part of the health care law that's their responsibility as  well.</p><p>Well, compared to what?  Is it me or is the government more concerned about  - well - its own tax headaches than your tax headaches, your burdens, your  rules to which you better comply, your myriad of new tax forms that you  better fill out.  Never mind you're overwhelmed, the Treasury Secretary  says it's a bigger deal because they are?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP - WASHINGTON, DC, YESTERDAY)</p><p>JACK LEW, TREASURY SECRETARY:  A sustained deterioration in taxpayer  service combined with reduced enforcement activity presents serious long- term risks for the U.S. tax system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP - WASHINGTON, DC, YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, he did not play the role of the quiet man.  That was John  Wayne.  That's Treasury Secretary Lew.  </p><p>Anyway, forget the long-term risks for the U.S. tax system.  CATO tax  policy analyst Dan Mitchell worries more about the long-term risks for the  U.S. taxpayer.</p><p>Dan, I think they've got it (INAUDIBLE) backwards here but fill me in on  what you think.</p><p>DAN MITCHELL, CATO TAX POLICY ANALYST:  If you look at the IRS budget  numbers over the last 30 years, you'll see that even after adjusting for  inflation, the IRS has almost twice as big of a budget now as they did 30  years ago.  Now, it's not as high as the peak in 2010 when all the fake  stimulus money was being thrown around in Washington and every agency was  drowning in taxpayer money there, their budgets were so blown-up.  But the  notion that we should feel sorry for the IRS and somehow we're not going to  get the right service from the IRS reminds me of the country boys I knew in  college who talked about bulls servicing cows.  Hey, if the IRS leaves us  alone, I'll be perfectly happy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Careful, there's a movie about that too but I'll think of it -  \"Deliverance\".  (INAUDIBLE).  Here's what worries me, Dan, that what  they're trying to say is if you're not getting this or you're waiting for  this, they're telegraphing it, they're doing some pre-hiney-covering and  that worries me too.  What else aren't they saying?  Or what else  potentially are they bracing us for?  </p><p>MITCHELL:  The IRS has almost a 100,000 employees.  As I've said, their  budget is almost twice as big adjusted for inflation as it was 30 years  ago.  The notion that they're claiming that they somehow can't competently  enforce the tax code?  Well, maybe if they didn't spend so much money  participating in an illegal rewrite of the Obamacare law, maybe if they  weren't trying to influence American elections by political biased approval  of different nonprofit groups, maybe if they just focused on their core  mission, they would have plenty of money to enforce the tax code.  And I  say this as someone who doesn't necessarily blame the IRS because it's the  politicians that have given us the 76.000-page tax code and that of course  is a burden, not just on us but the IRS doesn't know how to enforce that  either.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, if any of you at the IRS are watching this segment  right now, Dan is the one saying all of these horrible stuff.  I think  you're just doing a fine job myself.  But Dan, here's another thing that  kind of interests me on all of this.  To be fair to the IRS, they have the  financial burden of doing a lot of the financial part of the health care  law.  Now, I thought we hired 60,000 IRS agents to do this and that that  was going to be enough to cover it.  It seems to me that Treasury Secretary  Lew who was not John Wayne in \"The Quiet Man\" - just so people at home  would know - understand that might not be enough or what?</p><p>MITCHELL:  We definitely have one of these - what - immovable objects,  irresistible force conflicts because the tax code is such a mess and  because things like Obamacare are now supposed to be enforced by the IRS,  we have to fundamentally choose.  Do we either basically give massive power  and massive (INAUDIBLE) budgets to the IRS and basically let them tell us  how to live our lives?  Or do we basically resist and tell the politicians,  \"No, we've had enough\"?  We don't like the fact that our lives are being  looked into.  We don't like the fact that we have no privacy.  We don't  like the fact that we give up our constitutional presumption of innocence  when dealing with the IRS.  Maybe you guys in Washington on Capitol Hill  and the White House need to fix some of the mess in the tax code.  As far  as I'm concerned, I would much rather force them to change the tax code  than to simply give more money to the IRS to try to prop up a system that -  if we leave it on autopilot, we're going to wind up being Greece.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Dan.  Thank you very much.  For those who don't know at  home, Dan was the inspiration for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\"  </p><p>In the meantime, still calling them Blackburied?  \"What the Tech?!\",  someone forgot to tell Blackberry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Blackberry is branching out.  Ford is biking out.  And Dominos and  Pizza Hut with gizmos to help you order out.  We're here to figure them all  out on the hottest new segment in all of cable news because \"What the  Tech?!\" is here and all of your tech questions are answered each night,  every night.  If it's a digit, dig it, we are all over it.</p><p>I kind of like that.</p><p>Anyway, long before folks were even talking about it, so hip, so happening,  so me, we've already patented the name.  </p><p>Now, to tonight's big tech issues.</p><p>First up, Blackberry.  Given up for dead but it is still not giving up.   The company offering not one, not two, not three, but four new devices  aimed at the corporate and government crowd.  Sure, they've lost customers  but the only ones they still have are rabidly loyal and when it comes to  these raised keyboards, obsessively so.  </p><p>So what does Mashable's Christina Warren make all of this?  Before we get  to her, I just want to confirm for all of you, it was not a Blackberry  device that was an inspiration in \"Fast Times in Ridgemont High.\"  All  right?  We all clear on that?  Very close.  Phone - yes, they did have a  phone-in order pizza but it was not via Blackberry.</p><p>OK.  What do you make of this? </p><p>CHRISTINA WARREN, MASHABLE SENIOR TECH ANALYST:  It's not a bad move on  Blackberry's part.  They're coming out with four new devices.  One of them  is actually going to be a slider that actually has a keyboard that slides  out.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Physical keyboard (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WARREN:  It will still have (INAUDIBLE) keyboard.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is that (INAUDIBLE) what Blackberry (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WARREN:  It is not.  One other new device is called the \"Leap\" that they  announced this week is actually a full touch device and it's going to be  fairly low-cost.  They're kind of aiming it at the - I guess - early  enterprise market kind of--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Would your generation buy that?</p><p>WARREN:  No.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Why not?  You think they've come and gone?</p><p>WARREN:  They have.  They're not there with the apps.  But you know what?   They still have a really strong business presence.  They're still really  known for security.  So I think what they're really doing which is smart is  they're expanding into being more of a software company.  So they're  starting to put their software on other products including Android and iOS.   And I think that's really their big growth of opportunity.  Devices not so  much.  Like you said, there's still the loyalists, still the people who  love them and won't ever give them up.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, I know.</p><p>WARREN:  But--</p><p>CAVUTO:  They're out there.</p><p>WARREN:  They are out there.  But for everybody else has moved on.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  This next story was indeed the inspiration for \"Fast  Times in Ridgemont High\".  This was the one you've got to watch because are  you interested in ordering a slice on a smartwatch?  Well, Dominos is  testing it.  Rival Pizza Hut testing something very similar but not on a  watch, on a special device in your car.</p><p>Christina, what the tech?  What is this?  Are we in that much of a rush?</p><p>WARREN:  For pizza?  Yes.  And there's also a new magnet that you put on  your fridge and you literally press a button, it orders you pizza.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, sign me up.</p><p>WARREN:  No.  See, this sounds silly at first, right?  Like, do we really  need pizza any faster?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Not at all.  Not to me.</p><p>WARREN:  But if you think about it, OK.  So take it away from pizza and  say, maybe, have laundry pick-up or maybe I can have take-out order or  maybe my groceries can be ordered for me.  We're getting into the age of  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  But what if you have kids that keep hitting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WARREN:  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  It needs security.   But we're kind of reaching this age where everything can be automated and  customized in such a way that we can do one-touch ordering and it can be  delivered the way you want it, when you want it, wherever.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  The kid reference was a reference to \"Home Alone\" and  \"Home Alone 2\".</p><p>Meanwhile, what the tech?!  Ford is peddling bicycles with apparently not  just any bicycles, the automaker - at least the last time I checked - is  creating a new e-bicycle with navigation sensors.  The thing even folds up.</p><p>Christina, does this have like just \"steal me\" written all over it?</p><p>WARREN:  It does.  It does.  But it also has - for me, I'm like \"I want to  ride this\" because this looks amazing.  They're taking the best of--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, why are they doing it?</p><p>WARREN:  Well, a lot of people are not driving these days especially a lot  of young people.  They look at studies, people are getting their licenses  older and people are not getting into cars as much.</p><p>CAVUTO:  This is (INAUDIBLE) people are going to - would you ride this?</p><p>WARREN:  You know what?  I might.  Especially that folds up.  Say I can use  it for GPS navigation with my phone.  It can help me pedal if it gets too  hard especially when the weather's nicer.  Right now, I wouldn't ride a  bike.</p><p>CAVUTO:  (INAUDIBLE).  You know?  So Ford seems to be covering its  (INAUDIBLE).  What I noticed in all the pictures they show of it, they have  it in a car.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Which I like here it is in a car.</p><p>WARREN:  Well, they're saying you drive to the bike track and then you bike  around but (INAUDIBLE) you can just bike.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  So you think this (INAUDIBLE) that others might follow  suit because Google wants to do cars, Ford that does cars wants to do  bikes.  It just seems weird.</p><p>WARREN:  I think they're just trying to kind of cover all their bases.   They know that a lot of people especially in urban areas are trying to be  more green and are walking more, biking more so why not get into that  market while they can?</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Thank you.  </p><p>This is not from a clip the Andromeda Strain.  Very close.  Remember, he  blew up a bike but it was not that bike.  And it was certainly not Arnold  Schwarzenegger.  </p><p>All right.  Now, we know you weren't spending that gas money you were  saving.  And unfortunately, so do the folks at Target.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  We are still wondering, but enough about me.  Imagine inheriting a  thermometer from your parents.  You just throw it right out, right?  Now  imagine that thermometer is 134 years old.  It would be harder to get rid  of that.  Find out what family does with his landmark on \"STRANGE  INHERITANCE.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, expect more and pay less, just don't expect help getting that  giant bag of toilet paper off the top shelf because Target is planning to  cut thousands of its jobs.  It's not alone, companies big and small,  planning layoffs.</p><p>Market watcher, Craig Smith, who was indeed the inspiration for the captain  on the \"Titanic,\" in the movie \"The Titanic\" joins right now.  All right,  so Craig, what is going on here because a lot of these guys seemed to be  repeating the same story.</p><p>CRAIG SMITH, \"DON'T BANK ON IT\" AUTHOR:  Isn't that the truth, brick-and- mortar has got some lessons to learn here, Neil, as they walk down through  the graveyard JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Radioshack.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I thought consumers were coming back and you were the first to  warn, wait a minute, let's not party too soon here.</p><p>CRAIG:  Well, yes, and the reason I did not is because the economy hasn't  turned around, Neil.  Look, I mean, Brian Cornell has his work cut out for  him.  He is laying off some people, but watch what he is going to do like  $2 billion worth of stock back increasing his stock price, creating better  dividends.</p><p>I mean, Neil, from Q1 one of 2009 to the last numbers we have, the third  quarter of 2014, S&amp;P corporations have bought back $2.1 trillion worth of  stocks, Neil -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  What does that mean?</p><p>SMITH:  It means that they are showing great profits because of what they  are doing on their balance sheets, but not because they are bringing more  people in the stores, not because people are spending more money, and not  because they are making more money.</p><p>They are basically doing it by balance sheet corrections.  Neil, we cannot  see these corporations make big money when we are growing an economy at 2  percent, Neil.  It doesn't work.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So I'm beginning to wonder and we've seen in income and spending  numbers.  Income up a little bit and spending down a little bit.  This has  been a trend of like where consumers, whatever savings they are getting and  we will be exploring this a little bit more in the show, they are just not  spending it and I wonder whether they see something.</p><p>SMITH:  That's an interesting question and I will have to speculate.  But  Neil, we know for a fact that every penny at the pump means a billion  dollars in the economy.  We have seen at least $100 billion in gas prices  coming into this economy.  Where did it go?</p><p>We don't see anybody ripping the cover off the ball other than Apple, which  by the way, if my watch goes off, I have a piece on order -- but it's  amazing because you know as well as I do and Fox Business has done a great  job covering this.</p><p>The underlying economy is not growing at the pace that we need to hold  these corporate profits were they are.  That is why corporations are buying  back their stock.  Think about it, if your corporate bond rate is at  historic low, 3.8 percent return, your forward earnings are 5.8 percent.</p><p>And your CEO, you buy your stock back.  You make your stock go up.  You pay  more money in dividends to your shareholders -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  No, Craig, you are absolutely right.  But here is the flip side  why people kind of like this perverse as it sounds that in this environment  there is no way the Federal Reserve will hike rates.  You will still be  able to play this game where you borrow low and buy whatever and that this  will kind of keep this slow-moving puppy going.  What do you think?</p><p>SMITH:  If -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right.</p><p>SMITH:  If investors don't start looking at other markets that are now  starting to use QE to do the same thing because if you see Europe do this,  you're going to see a bunch of money leave America and go to Europe looking  for the same return -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  So does that hit the Nasdaq as well?  A lot of people have been  saying that's a tech bubble there.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I'm not sure it's a tech bubble because this time they have  earnings.  You know, before the last tech bubble, companies open up.  They  never had any earnings or any profits and went from zero to $200 per share.</p><p>But Neil, we don't have the underlying economic strength to support this  and that is why I wish Mr. Barack Obama would get out of the way and let  free enterprise work.  I really do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Craig, good seeing you again.</p><p>SMITH:  Good seeing you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Great info.  Craig Smith, the Swiss America Trading Corp chairman,  as I said, the inspiration for the captain in \"The Titanic.\"</p><p>All right, well, more than two years after Sandy, all the money that never  made it to the victims.  Now we know.  Don't say that I didn't warn you  then.  Several Republican lawmakers want to wait until they know exactly  where each dollar is going.</p><p>Now before you start saying this sounds cruel and awful, think of all the  money we have wasted not tracking it, the money that went to Haiti to help  them out and that never really help them out, the money that went post- Katrina that never helped anyone out in Louisiana.</p><p>You know, I hate to say it, but this is a one-time I wish that I was wrong.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY:  There is only one group to blame  for the continued suffering of these innocent victims, the House Majority  and their Speaker John Boehner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Governor Chris Christie was not the inspiration for \"Godzilla,\"  just a point of reference, although the movie was twice a hit, back then  the governor wasn't exactly feeling the love for the guy he said was  holding up all of that dough.</p><p>Now a lot of folks are asking what really was the rush, a top FEMA official  now admitting government-backed insurers have been fudging data to deny  flood insurance settlements, and even knew about it for over a year, and  they dare castigated this guy?  Michael Brown not at all surprised.   Michael, what do you make of this?</p><p>MICHAEL BROWN, FORMER FEMA DIRECTOR:  Neil, you have heard of crony  capitalism, ask yourself a simple question, why do we have flood insurance  that's subsidized and paid for by the taxpayers?  Why do we not have  tornado insurance, hurricane insurance, ice storm insurance, thunderstorm  insurance?</p><p>It's because the insurance companies somehow convinced Congress decades ago  that they didn't want to deal with the actuarial problems and the  repetitive claims you had the flood insurance so they pond that off onto  FEMA.</p><p>And so now you have a program that for decades even while I was at FEMA was  problematic.  It's not actuarially sound.  Congress is always interfering  and telling people you should pay these claims or you can't charge this  premium.  It is a perfect example of a program that should be in the  private sector and the government shouldn't have its hands anywhere near  it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So what was FEMA's role in this?  Is it mistaken, deliberate, just  dumb, what?</p><p>BROWN:  Yes, all of the above.  I think there's probably everything going  on, Neil.  I think there are probably some folks that work in the National  Flood Insurance Program where these kinds of fraudulent claims just went  passed them.  They just didn't notice it.</p><p>You may have some people within FEMA who deliberately were in cahoots with  some of these engineering companies and insurance companies.  And then you  have the leadership who goes on another program and says to themselves,  I've been here three weeks and this is something that should have been  brought to us.</p><p>Well, that is a systemic problem within the government when you have those  kinds of programs.  It just shouldn't be in the government in the first  place.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, but we know either directly or indirectly through FEMA  and all of these other federal sources, $60 billion was allocated to deal  with Sandy.</p><p>And you know, talking to friends and those who were affected in Statin  Island, much of New Jersey, I'm not saying that none of them got it, but  not nearly the number you would think.  There are people to this day, Mike,  still waiting for this stuff.  What does that say?</p><p>BROWN:  It says that government is inherently incapable of doing what  Americans for I think the wrong reasons have come to expect the government  to do and that's to come in and rebuild their lives for them.</p><p>Look, I have the deepest sympathy for people whose lives are upended by  Mother Nature or a man-made disaster, but at the end of the day, people  have to recognize that government isn't going to be the answer.</p><p>The answer is going to be to make sure you have your own insurance, to make  sure that you are prepared for those disasters and make sure that you can  recover from them as quickly as possible and if you're waiting on somebody  inside the beltway to take care of you, you're just being foolish.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm still waiting for Governor Christie or now Governor Cuomo, and  these others to come out and simply say we were wrong.  I'd love to hear  that.</p><p>BROWN:  Neil, you know, we're close to the ten-year anniversary of Katrina  and there are still problems there in New Orleans so you know, welcome to  the club.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, but I'll tell you what?  I know I told you this before,  Michael, they jumped to point the finger at you.  Something far more  egregious what happened here.  No one says boo.  That is ridiculous.</p><p>BROWN:  Yes, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Michael Brown, thank you very, very so much, the former FEMA  director.  Who, if you want to know the accurate story, warned about  everything that ultimately did happen with Katrina.</p><p>Anyway, the Supreme Court is taking up Obamacare again.  The media says  this is another conservative attack.  So then why are doctors and patients  scrambling to fend off a premium attack?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS:  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Actress and producer,  Goldie Hawn on equal pay in Hollywood and how it is blocking some movies  from being made.  OPENING BELL at 9 a.m. Eastern right here on the Fox  Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO:  In tonight's Biz Blitz.  Obamacare take \"D,\" the Supreme Court  once again taking off an argument that cuts to the Affordable Care Act's  core, those subsidies that help folks buy it.</p><p>Do the justices buy it or will they rule that any subsidy violates the  constitution and just junk it or throw it in Congress' lap.  Remember it's  those subsidies that get people in so what happens if that carrot goes?</p><p>That is pretty much at the heart of Republicans arguments and why they took  it to the high court.  To Jared Levy and Lizzie Macdonald, why a ruling in  their favor could actually put Republicans in a very sticky position,  Lizzie, what do you think?</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS:  You know, I'll tell you something.  No  less than nine times in the Affordable Care Act does it say that the tax  breaks or credits were meant for states that built their own exchanges,  period.  That's what it says.</p><p>It did not say the IRS is allowed to define the law after the fact and make  up rules and regulations ad hoc after-the-fact.  And I'll tell you  something, even though they are saying chaos, the world is going to hell in  a handbasket, you can get catastrophic insurance interim if this law falls  apart at the Supreme Court level.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, now let's say that these are unconstitutional, what do  Republicans do because it would be thrown back in their lap?  All right,  that's a find mess you got us into.  Premiums are soaring.  Costs are  soaring and it's all because you guys are protesting.  What do you think,  Jared?</p><p>JARED LEVY, PROFITABLE TRADING.COM SENIOR STRATEGIST:  It's funny.  It is a  really selfish choice when you think about it because on one hand, yes, you  have this act, which is now putting insurance companies in control of the  ways that we get treated as patients, personally, professionally, I've  experienced nothing but bad things.</p><p>But you're right.  If Republicans do over throw this, if we do breakdown  the subsidies in 34 states and if people don't get their subsidies, you got  7.5 million people who aren't voting for a GOP candidate next election.   That's a guarantee just about so again I'd like to see it repealed, but it  does hurt the GOP if indeed that does happen.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Al right, Jared was quoting Sophie's choice, but this was actually  inspiration for the movie \"The Scarlet Letter.\"  Meanwhile, something to  cushion a fired CEO, McDonald's is paying its ousted boss, Don Thompson, $3  million as a consultant, which is about three times more than the salary of  his successor.</p><p>It's true.  While the new guy is still a 69 percent pay, the salary part of  that is 1.1 million, he gets things cooking, he could be getting another $1  million to $1.5 million incentive, but Lizzie, that is still not equal to  the pay of the guy that he replaced.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, this is quite a happy meal that McDonald's is giving its  exiting CEO.  The golden arch is giving quite a golden parachute to a guy  who oversaw a sales slide in the U.S. but less is less, and now two years,  he is a consultant.</p><p>And lo and behold, you just saw the other news that McDonald's is finally  saying that we are going to take antibiotics out of our meat products.   Well, guess, what Panero Bread and Chipotle already did that.</p><p>You know, I mentioned, Chipotle, McDonald's should never spun it off.  It's  now worth a fifth of its entire market cap -- so I don't know what's going  on here.  I don't why you pay the guy more money who didn't really do such  a great job improving McDonald's.</p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, we keep referencing movies here and while this guy is  going to remain a consultant of McDonald's, I was, everything is going to  be disclosed here and consulted.  Jared, what do you think of this?</p><p>LEVY:  All right, so first of all, Thompson was there for 25 years so I  think he's staying on as a consultant as an exit strategy is smart.  Paying  him $3 million not so much, but it's interesting though, you look at from a  stock perspective.</p><p>The stocks knocking on new 52-week highs and while that is a lot of the way  that we measure this, I think a lot of it is just a happy meal that  investors should be given.  There is a lot of hope here that this new CEO,  Easterbrook, is going to change things.</p><p>So we have to talk about this from this perspective.  I do not think that  McDonald's is a smart bet right now.  I think that it moves lower before it  continues back on its meteoric rise.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, onto issue three here, guys, after talking millions and  saving pennies, we have been getting it.  Those pennies that Americans were  saving with the lower gas prices are not translating into a billion-dollar  boon for corporations, more like a hit, a bad hit.</p><p>We are telling you how Target is laying off folks.  It's a clear sign  customers are not spending it.  Apparently, they are worried about savings  accounts.  What's got them worried, Lizzie?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know, what's got them worried, there are other  analysts out there, debt and record levels near the $12 trillion that never  really came down.  They are worried about, you know, health care costs  going up so according to the conference board just a fifth of the consumers  are going out to retail stores to buy things, doing things like paying  their debt and sucking it away for health care.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The customers still looks pretty wobbly to me, Jared, should we  worry?</p><p>LEVY:  I don't know about worry all around.  I think we need to do is  dissect this a little bit deeper.  First of all, \"Consumer Reports\" came  out with a great report, great story about how consumers habits of change.</p><p>They are buying bigger stuff.  They are buying cars, washing machines,  stuff that's fixed.  They are not buying a lot of little trinket and stuff  like Target may sell, right?</p><p>So maybe look to sort of big appliance companies from an investment  perspective, but watch some of the retailers that cater to some of the more  frivolous if you will. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, where are they going, dollar store, and these kinds of cheap  alternatives?</p><p>MACDONALD:  It seems that way and they are buying -- Jared is right.  They  are buying groceries.  They are not to the retailers or certainly the  luxury retailers.  And you know what, they are kind of buying cars, but  they are definitely not going to the mall to the department stores.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Jared, if that keeps up, though, the theory is that you -- the big  items that you could buy, but eventually that well runs dry.</p><p>LEVY:  There is a compounding problem there, right, as the dollar rises,  all of the Europeans and Asians coming are spending their money on the  high-end products, now we have the double effect and so I think that yes,  potentially, we could see this move lower in a lot of the high-end  retailers.  So this is a sector by sector thing and I don't think it will  cause an economic crisis anytime soon.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to thank you both very much.</p><p>In the meantime, take a look at this, it's an Apple spaceship.  I want you  to find out which tech companies are giving Apple a ship?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  To a tech takeover, if you are impressed with Apple spaceship  campus, get a load of Google's plans for a tented city, a fully functional  headquarters complete with running tracks and restaurants, and did I  mention, it's all climate controlled.</p><p>Google is not alone.  By the way, tech titans like LinkedIn and Facebook  also on a real estate buying binge prepping pricey headquarters to cook up  new inventions.  So what the tech are they planning?  Find out tomorrow,  the hottest news segment in all of cable news.</p><p>Every day we bring you the latest, the coolest before anyone else is  talking about it.  A way for you to profit off of it and not just because  it might have been the inspiration for Tom Cruise in vanilla sky, that's up  to you.  That's up to you.  Run with it.

Forget about ever really doing it, we can't even fake doing it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everyone. Glad to have you. I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And talk about a \"House of Cards\", literally, because the fictional president on that fictional NetFlix show takes a fictional stab at entitlement spending and liberal blogs are going seriously nuts. But even more seriously nuts when I bring up the ridiculous reaction to this utterly ridiculous, totally made-up issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP - \"YOUR WORLD\", YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO: The Huffington Post detailing how Underwood's goal of zero unemployment is impossible and that even if he did get there, inflation would get out of control everywhere.</p><p>This tell you all you need to know, that even cutting entitlements on a fake show with a fake president gets this type of real irate response. This is Rome in the final days.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP - \"YOUR WORLD\", YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, you can almost guess what happens next - angry Liberals jumping on moi for them jumping on this.</p><p>This headline on a very popular media website summed it up. \"Fox's Cavuto Proudly Stands with the President (No, Not Obama)\". The writer goes on to explain that I was seriously rushing to a fake President Underwood's defense.</p><p>Newsflash! I wasn't rushing to anyone's defense, just wondering why so many were taking offense over something that wasn't real and a President and a whole storyline that are totally made-up. It didn't matter. I was just seriously evil.</p><p>I want you to take a look at just some of the responses.</p><p>Like this one: \"Figures Cavuto loves Frank Underwood more than Barack Obama...\"</p><p>Then this: \"Fake President for a fake news channel.\"</p><p>This one I personally like: \"Pravda and Tass are models for Fox News.\"</p><p>And then this one: \"Cavuto's a troll and a midget ogre.\" I have no idea what that means.</p><p>\"Obviously, Cavuto's OK letting our poor suffer. He makes Underwood look like Lincoln.\"</p><p>Then this: \"What a heartless bastard this fat Fox fake is... all for cutting entitlements any way he can.\" Who are you calling \"fat\"?</p><p>Anyway, \"Most people are aware that Repubs suffer Schizophrenia..\", I forgot, \"..mixed with racism...\", I forgot that too, \"...it's a dangerous combo.\"</p><p>Then this: \"Underwood's cut to entitlements fund a $500 billion stimulus program. Cavuto didn't mention that.\"</p><p>Well, actually, I did mention that but who needs facts on something that's fake and thank God for at least some viewers who did know what I was getting at.</p><p>Like this guy: \"This headline is so deceptive. The Fox host was ranting about a fictional character being taken seriously by left-wing websites and somehow he is defending him? This website is growing worse day by day.\"</p><p>Now, there were a lot of other emails like that last one. In fact, most emails were like that last one. But my point here wasn't to make me look good. I don't have to.</p><p>Anyway, my other point though was to quite seriously take a look at how difficult it is to ever get a handle on real entitlement reform because even when we're discussing a fake show, my God, we can't even fake it. And if that's the case, we really are a financial 'House of Cards'.</p><p>To political watcher Steve Moore, Sabrina Schaeffer, Julie Roginsky.</p><p>Steve, what do you think?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, Neil, it is a (INAUDIBLE) fake character and it is a fake show. But you know what? It's not a fake crisis. This entitlement time bomb that is (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: You're feeding the beast, Moore. You're feeding the beast.</p><p>MOORE: Well, you had it exactly right. This is a real crisis. Ten thousand Americans are retiring every day. They're going on Medicare. They're going on social security. This is the Titanic headed right towards the iceberg. And shame on you for saying maybe we should start turning that ship away from the iceberg. But you're right on.</p><p>CAVUTO: But here's the thing, Sabrina. I mean, even when a fake show lobs this up, silly as it was, it gets this type of reaction. People are seriously all worked-up about it. So Sabrina, my worry with this is if we can't even get to it on a fake entitlement address, how are we ever going to get serious about it?</p><p>SABRINA SCHAEFFER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, here's the thing, Neil, and this is where the writers got Frank Underwood totally wrong. Democrats would never have released something like Frank Underwood does on this AmWorks program without intensive persuasion messaging research. Frank Underwood would never have just talked about entitlement reform the way he did in that meeting in that scene in the show. In fact, the Independent Women's Forum did conduct a randomized controlled experiment to figure out how do we talk about it and talking about entitlement reform is not the sort of bomb that we're thinking it is. In fact, when you talk about cutting spending or to preserve entitlements, Americans are strongly behind it. They're strongly behind constraining our budget and as well as reforming entitlements and that's good news.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. My worry with this, Julie, is that we take at face value that anything that comes up there (INAUDIBLE) by that definition, on a fake show, in \"Planet of the Apes\". I guess the subliminal messages - we're not careful, this is us in just a few decades. I mean, we've got to get serious.</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC PARTY STRATEGIST: You know why I'm so mad at you and your producers right now? I was sitting in my office minding my own business. They sent me this clip and they said, \"Do you want to do the show today?\" and you totally ruined the \"House of Cards\" for me. I was going to spend this weekend watching it and then you spoiled the whole thing. So--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I didn't give away how he - how he addresses this. I just--</p><p>ROGINSKY: I don't want to talk about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: --told you what one episode is about.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I have made people keep their mouths shut for a week and you ruined my day. Thank you very much. Look, I actually agree with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know it's fiction because it's a Democrats' series about a budget so you know it's fiction.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes. I forgot the last Democrat that actually gave us a balanced - oh, OK. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Touche, young lady.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes, yes. Touche. His name was (INAUDIBLE). His name - his name was Bill Clinton, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO: But even you, Julie - Julie, come on. Julie, even you - and I think Bill Clinton would take offense to everyone getting hyper about it.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I agree. Actually, I agree with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You agree, right?</p><p>ROGINSKY: Totally. This is insane.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So Steve, she agrees. Democrats and Repubs are on the same page: \"Everyone, lighten up.\" What say you?</p><p>MOORE: Well, look, first of all, I didn't even know Underwood was President so that's how far behind I am on this stuff. But - so thanks a lot. No, but look, here's the point. We know this. We have tens of trillions - that's trillions with a \"T\" - of unfunded liabilities in these programs. If we don't fix them, Neil, whether it's fictionally or in real life, we're going to end up - this country's going to end up like Detroit, in bankruptcy court.</p><p>CAVUTO: But even mentioning them on a fictitious show and what worries me- -.</p><p>MOORE: Well, that's the whole point.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: But again, you know--.</p><p>MOORE: But you know, Millennials like - Millennials do want to fix these programs.</p><p>CAVUTO: I agree. I agree. But I should (INAUDIBLE) to our audience that in \"Dr. DoLittle\", the animals do not really talk. I just want them to be aware of that. They do not really talk. Although some of them I think could if pushed.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I also don't think the President's killed two people with his own hands in the history of this country but I may be wrong about that. Frank Underwood's done a lot worse than (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know about that. I don't know about that.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I don't think he's pushed anybody from the D.C. metro anytime but I may be wrong about that.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Let me add though that I don't think this is a political disaster either. I think that - I hope that people will take a look at the research that we did on this issue because it's not a lose-lose. It's a - there's a win politically and there's a win policy-wise. We have to deal with this issue because the pay-as-you-go system as Steve acknowledges is no longer working and--. But I think Americans are more behind reforming this. It's a matter of how do we talk about it in a way that makes people comfortable, it makes people realize that we're actually trying to preserve these systems for the future.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well-said.</p><p>Guys, I want to thank you all. One other footnote to make - a lot of you who were confused whether the Linda Blair character in \"Exorcist\" was built on Nancy Pelosi. That one, you're right. That was in fact, the case.</p><p>Just lighten up, everyone. Lighten up.</p><p>Meanwhile, fake or real, it really doesn't matter because if these ladies are right, no one is serious about government spending at all, least of all, get this, Republicans.</p><p>To columnist Gina Loudon, Katherine Timf who say perish the thought.</p><p>What - Gina, what's going on here? Republicans are giving up the fight?</p><p>GINA LOUDON, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: This is my question I really want to know how to answer. I speak around probably like you do to audiences of true patriots who elected this leadership and put them where they are and they are expecting some accountability. This is really what it comes down to. How do you answer the question? If Boehner was going to cave on this, Neil, why didn't he cave a week ago, just before that? Why didn't he - why did he wait until it was truly a war--.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you're angry (INAUDIBLE) dropped the ball again? 'Cause he did try their idea first and it fell through, right, (INAUDIBLE) the votes.</p><p>LOUDON: But when you - when you pit yourself against someone who you say, \"This is a fight\", and you lay down--. Let me ask you something. When's the last time they didn't lay down?</p><p>CAVUTO: I ask the questions around here, lady. What do you think this is? NetFlix?</p><p>LOUDON: When is the last time they didn't lay down? When is the last time you ever saw Boehner actually win a fight? When? I've never seen it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, now, Katherine, she's (INAUDIBLE) because whether you agree or disagree, there are quite a few like her who are not copacetic with the mainstream party and how it handles this stuff.</p><p>KATHERINE TIMPF, NATIONAL REVIEW COLUMNIST: Right. If you look at what he said towards the beginning, just like you said, he came out saying, \"Watch out, Obama. You can't do this\" and he can't. He actually can't. The executive order on the immigration--</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, so did President Underwood. You know where that--.</p><p>TIMPF: --not able to do that. But the thing is even on a branding level, they're not doing a great job because right now, the Democrats are saying, \"See how far the Republicans were willing to go because of how racist they are and they hate this immigration law.\" When really, it was about the fact that it's not constitutional. So there are so many issues here.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, wait, I got no emails on that - that Republicans are racist- -.</p><p>TIMPF: If you look at liberal internet, they're saying, \"See, they're so racist. They would let terrorists invade us and defunding the DHS\" which, by the way, this is the only time I've ever heard them concerned about ISIS at all now that it's political.</p><p>CAVUTO: All of a sudden, they're concerned.</p><p>LOUDON: Right. Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Gina, I mean, your argument is we've got to be very close to understanding the threats that faces financial otherwise, and that Republicans have to be looking at that in their nominee whoever that is. If it were a Jeb Bush, if it were a Chris Christie, what would Gina Loudon do?</p><p>LOUDON: Well, I'll tell you, this administration has put us all in a mindset of we've got to have someone who isn't Barack Obama and certainly isn't Hillary or any of the selections that we're seeing come out of their camp. So we do - people in this country are worried about economic security and national security. That is number one on their mind that's paramount to the voters and that's not just conservatives. That is across the board when you talk (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But you don't like the guys I mentioned earlier?</p><p>LOUDON: I'm not - those aren't my number one choices. No. But I will say this - why instead - what has got to happen from the GOP and I still don't understand it is messaging, messaging, messaging and you alluded to this. You - why - instead of laying down again - didn't they just get on the messaging horse and just win this? The argument was so very simple and understandable for the average American and instead, they just kind of cower.</p><p>CAVUTO: Here's where I give them the benefit of the doubt. No, no. Here's where - I understand what you're saying but Katherine, they have to get through the mainstream media that will never cut them a break, that will call them - as you say - \"racist\", (INAUDIBLE) \"You're going to shut down government\" when we know in that case, that was never what this was going to be about. But they have to get through that. How do they?</p><p>TIMPF: They really do. Well, maybe they need to think about it before they go blazing saddles out with something like this. I don't know why they chose the DHS.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, blazing saddles was not a real (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. Yes. Wait, what?</p><p>CAVUTO: Was not a real event.</p><p>TIMPF: I have so many political opinions about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: The budget might be blazing but I digress.</p><p>TIMPF: But they came out and they weren't prepared to fight it to the end. And I don't know why they chose the DHS, like I was saying, rather than Department of Education. Of course DHS' mostly agencies that actually fight terrorism aren't even under that umbrella necessarily--.</p><p>CAVUTO: But that was interesting. Then all of a sudden, they were - the Democrats were concerned about terror.</p><p>TIMPF: All of a sudden, they're saying, \"(INAUDIBLE) the DHS. But ISIS is going to invade us immediately if we even partially defund it.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: But Republicans dug themselves in that pit, didn't they?</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>LOUDON: So all they had to say was \"Look, this is 15 percent of employees who have mostly desk jobs.\" So somebody not playing Solitaire at their desk next week is not going affect Homeland Security. Let's be real about this.</p><p>CAVUTO: They're not all playing Solitaire. Some of them are on porn. Now, so, what do Republicans do right now? What's done is done, what's gone is gone?</p><p>TIMPF: It's humiliating. They need to find something that they all agree on and stand behind that and do it. 'Cause right now, they had this majority and it doesn't even matter because they can't agree on anything, it seems like. So they need to prove that they're powerful and not just reactive to everything.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gina?</p><p>LOUDON: I agree. They've got to stand. The Republicans have better - look at Reagan. He just stood and he convinced the country he was right. That's leadership. Look at (INAUDIBLE). He stands.</p><p>CAVUTO: But he also budged on - he raised taxes in 1986. They were still lower than they were when he took office but he was good at negotiating.</p><p>LOUDON: He was big at leading. People need a leader in this country. We are - we are looking at all the threats - North Korea, of course, Iran, so on and so forth, and we're watching as other leaders around the country lead and the leaders in this country including the Republican leaders right now are refusing to lead. They're making commitments. They're making strong stands. And then they're backing down or they're just cowering to start. It's a very scary place to be right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you're saying that a guy who started as an actor in movies was in fact a real leader?</p><p>LOUDON: He was in fact a real leader.</p><p>CAVUTO: Take that, Underwood.</p><p>LOUDON: That brings it full circle.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know we're going to get emails on this show. People, lighten up!</p><p>All right. In the meantime, the IRS is singing the budget blues. Now, who exactly is singing yours?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Talk about taxing and the IRS complaining. Now, well, you've already heard how the agency's been whining about budget cuts that has supposedly compromised its ability to audit you. But now, the Treasury's chiming in to say those same cuts are going to create even more headaches for you. They might not be able to get refunds out as fast or administer the financial part of the health care law that's their responsibility as well.</p><p>Well, compared to what? Is it me or is the government more concerned about - well - its own tax headaches than your tax headaches, your burdens, your rules to which you better comply, your myriad of new tax forms that you better fill out. Never mind you're overwhelmed, the Treasury Secretary says it's a bigger deal because they are?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP - WASHINGTON, DC, YESTERDAY)</p><p>JACK LEW, TREASURY SECRETARY: A sustained deterioration in taxpayer service combined with reduced enforcement activity presents serious long- term risks for the U.S. tax system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP - WASHINGTON, DC, YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, he did not play the role of the quiet man. That was John Wayne. That's Treasury Secretary Lew.</p><p>Anyway, forget the long-term risks for the U.S. tax system. CATO tax policy analyst Dan Mitchell worries more about the long-term risks for the U.S. taxpayer.</p><p>Dan, I think they've got it (INAUDIBLE) backwards here but fill me in on what you think.</p><p>DAN MITCHELL, CATO TAX POLICY ANALYST: If you look at the IRS budget numbers over the last 30 years, you'll see that even after adjusting for inflation, the IRS has almost twice as big of a budget now as they did 30 years ago. Now, it's not as high as the peak in 2010 when all the fake stimulus money was being thrown around in Washington and every agency was drowning in taxpayer money there, their budgets were so blown-up. But the notion that we should feel sorry for the IRS and somehow we're not going to get the right service from the IRS reminds me of the country boys I knew in college who talked about bulls servicing cows. Hey, if the IRS leaves us alone, I'll be perfectly happy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Careful, there's a movie about that too but I'll think of it - \"Deliverance\". (INAUDIBLE). Here's what worries me, Dan, that what they're trying to say is if you're not getting this or you're waiting for this, they're telegraphing it, they're doing some pre-hiney-covering and that worries me too. What else aren't they saying? Or what else potentially are they bracing us for?</p><p>MITCHELL: The IRS has almost a 100,000 employees. As I've said, their budget is almost twice as big adjusted for inflation as it was 30 years ago. The notion that they're claiming that they somehow can't competently enforce the tax code? Well, maybe if they didn't spend so much money participating in an illegal rewrite of the Obamacare law, maybe if they weren't trying to influence American elections by political biased approval of different nonprofit groups, maybe if they just focused on their core mission, they would have plenty of money to enforce the tax code. And I say this as someone who doesn't necessarily blame the IRS because it's the politicians that have given us the 76.000-page tax code and that of course is a burden, not just on us but the IRS doesn't know how to enforce that either.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, if any of you at the IRS are watching this segment right now, Dan is the one saying all of these horrible stuff. I think you're just doing a fine job myself. But Dan, here's another thing that kind of interests me on all of this. To be fair to the IRS, they have the financial burden of doing a lot of the financial part of the health care law. Now, I thought we hired 60,000 IRS agents to do this and that that was going to be enough to cover it. It seems to me that Treasury Secretary Lew who was not John Wayne in \"The Quiet Man\" - just so people at home would know - understand that might not be enough or what?</p><p>MITCHELL: We definitely have one of these - what - immovable objects, irresistible force conflicts because the tax code is such a mess and because things like Obamacare are now supposed to be enforced by the IRS, we have to fundamentally choose. Do we either basically give massive power and massive (INAUDIBLE) budgets to the IRS and basically let them tell us how to live our lives? Or do we basically resist and tell the politicians, \"No, we've had enough\"? We don't like the fact that our lives are being looked into. We don't like the fact that we have no privacy. We don't like the fact that we give up our constitutional presumption of innocence when dealing with the IRS. Maybe you guys in Washington on Capitol Hill and the White House need to fix some of the mess in the tax code. As far as I'm concerned, I would much rather force them to change the tax code than to simply give more money to the IRS to try to prop up a system that - if we leave it on autopilot, we're going to wind up being Greece.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Dan. Thank you very much. For those who don't know at home, Dan was the inspiration for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\"</p><p>In the meantime, still calling them Blackburied? \"What the Tech?!\", someone forgot to tell Blackberry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Blackberry is branching out. Ford is biking out. And Dominos and Pizza Hut with gizmos to help you order out. We're here to figure them all out on the hottest new segment in all of cable news because \"What the Tech?!\" is here and all of your tech questions are answered each night, every night. If it's a digit, dig it, we are all over it.</p><p>I kind of like that.</p><p>Anyway, long before folks were even talking about it, so hip, so happening, so me, we've already patented the name.</p><p>Now, to tonight's big tech issues.</p><p>First up, Blackberry. Given up for dead but it is still not giving up. The company offering not one, not two, not three, but four new devices aimed at the corporate and government crowd. Sure, they've lost customers but the only ones they still have are rabidly loyal and when it comes to these raised keyboards, obsessively so.</p><p>So what does Mashable's Christina Warren make all of this? Before we get to her, I just want to confirm for all of you, it was not a Blackberry device that was an inspiration in \"Fast Times in Ridgemont High.\" All right? We all clear on that? Very close. Phone - yes, they did have a phone-in order pizza but it was not via Blackberry.</p><p>OK. What do you make of this?</p><p>CHRISTINA WARREN, MASHABLE SENIOR TECH ANALYST: It's not a bad move on Blackberry's part. They're coming out with four new devices. One of them is actually going to be a slider that actually has a keyboard that slides out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Physical keyboard (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WARREN: It will still have (INAUDIBLE) keyboard.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that (INAUDIBLE) what Blackberry (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WARREN: It is not. One other new device is called the \"Leap\" that they announced this week is actually a full touch device and it's going to be fairly low-cost. They're kind of aiming it at the - I guess - early enterprise market kind of--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Would your generation buy that?</p><p>WARREN: No.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why not? You think they've come and gone?</p><p>WARREN: They have. They're not there with the apps. But you know what? They still have a really strong business presence. They're still really known for security. So I think what they're really doing which is smart is they're expanding into being more of a software company. So they're starting to put their software on other products including Android and iOS. And I think that's really their big growth of opportunity. Devices not so much. Like you said, there's still the loyalists, still the people who love them and won't ever give them up.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, I know.</p><p>WARREN: But--</p><p>CAVUTO: They're out there.</p><p>WARREN: They are out there. But for everybody else has moved on.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. This next story was indeed the inspiration for \"Fast Times in Ridgemont High\". This was the one you've got to watch because are you interested in ordering a slice on a smartwatch? Well, Dominos is testing it. Rival Pizza Hut testing something very similar but not on a watch, on a special device in your car.</p><p>Christina, what the tech? What is this? Are we in that much of a rush?</p><p>WARREN: For pizza? Yes. And there's also a new magnet that you put on your fridge and you literally press a button, it orders you pizza.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, sign me up.</p><p>WARREN: No. See, this sounds silly at first, right? Like, do we really need pizza any faster?</p><p>CAVUTO: Not at all. Not to me.</p><p>WARREN: But if you think about it, OK. So take it away from pizza and say, maybe, have laundry pick-up or maybe I can have take-out order or maybe my groceries can be ordered for me. We're getting into the age of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. But what if you have kids that keep hitting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WARREN: That's a good point. That's a good point. It needs security. But we're kind of reaching this age where everything can be automated and customized in such a way that we can do one-touch ordering and it can be delivered the way you want it, when you want it, wherever.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. The kid reference was a reference to \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2\".</p><p>Meanwhile, what the tech?! Ford is peddling bicycles with apparently not just any bicycles, the automaker - at least the last time I checked - is creating a new e-bicycle with navigation sensors. The thing even folds up.</p><p>Christina, does this have like just \"steal me\" written all over it?</p><p>WARREN: It does. It does. But it also has - for me, I'm like \"I want to ride this\" because this looks amazing. They're taking the best of--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, why are they doing it?</p><p>WARREN: Well, a lot of people are not driving these days especially a lot of young people. They look at studies, people are getting their licenses older and people are not getting into cars as much.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is (INAUDIBLE) people are going to - would you ride this?</p><p>WARREN: You know what? I might. Especially that folds up. Say I can use it for GPS navigation with my phone. It can help me pedal if it gets too hard especially when the weather's nicer. Right now, I wouldn't ride a bike.</p><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE). You know? So Ford seems to be covering its (INAUDIBLE). What I noticed in all the pictures they show of it, they have it in a car.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Which I like here it is in a car.</p><p>WARREN: Well, they're saying you drive to the bike track and then you bike around but (INAUDIBLE) you can just bike.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So you think this (INAUDIBLE) that others might follow suit because Google wants to do cars, Ford that does cars wants to do bikes. It just seems weird.</p><p>WARREN: I think they're just trying to kind of cover all their bases. They know that a lot of people especially in urban areas are trying to be more green and are walking more, biking more so why not get into that market while they can?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Thank you.</p><p>This is not from a clip the Andromeda Strain. Very close. Remember, he blew up a bike but it was not that bike. And it was certainly not Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>All right. Now, we know you weren't spending that gas money you were saving. And unfortunately, so do the folks at Target.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: We are still wondering, but enough about me. Imagine inheriting a thermometer from your parents. You just throw it right out, right? Now imagine that thermometer is 134 years old. It would be harder to get rid of that. Find out what family does with his landmark on \"STRANGE INHERITANCE.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, expect more and pay less, just don't expect help getting that giant bag of toilet paper off the top shelf because Target is planning to cut thousands of its jobs. It's not alone, companies big and small, planning layoffs.</p><p>Market watcher, Craig Smith, who was indeed the inspiration for the captain on the \"Titanic,\" in the movie \"The Titanic\" joins right now. All right, so Craig, what is going on here because a lot of these guys seemed to be repeating the same story.</p><p>CRAIG SMITH, \"DON'T BANK ON IT\" AUTHOR: Isn't that the truth, brick-and- mortar has got some lessons to learn here, Neil, as they walk down through the graveyard JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Radioshack.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I thought consumers were coming back and you were the first to warn, wait a minute, let's not party too soon here.</p><p>CRAIG: Well, yes, and the reason I did not is because the economy hasn't turned around, Neil. Look, I mean, Brian Cornell has his work cut out for him. He is laying off some people, but watch what he is going to do like $2 billion worth of stock back increasing his stock price, creating better dividends.</p><p>I mean, Neil, from Q1 one of 2009 to the last numbers we have, the third quarter of 2014, S&amp;P corporations have bought back $2.1 trillion worth of stocks, Neil --</p><p>CAVUTO: What does that mean?</p><p>SMITH: It means that they are showing great profits because of what they are doing on their balance sheets, but not because they are bringing more people in the stores, not because people are spending more money, and not because they are making more money.</p><p>They are basically doing it by balance sheet corrections. Neil, we cannot see these corporations make big money when we are growing an economy at 2 percent, Neil. It doesn't work.</p><p>CAVUTO: So I'm beginning to wonder and we've seen in income and spending numbers. Income up a little bit and spending down a little bit. This has been a trend of like where consumers, whatever savings they are getting and we will be exploring this a little bit more in the show, they are just not spending it and I wonder whether they see something.</p><p>SMITH: That's an interesting question and I will have to speculate. But Neil, we know for a fact that every penny at the pump means a billion dollars in the economy. We have seen at least $100 billion in gas prices coming into this economy. Where did it go?</p><p>We don't see anybody ripping the cover off the ball other than Apple, which by the way, if my watch goes off, I have a piece on order -- but it's amazing because you know as well as I do and Fox Business has done a great job covering this.</p><p>The underlying economy is not growing at the pace that we need to hold these corporate profits were they are. That is why corporations are buying back their stock. Think about it, if your corporate bond rate is at historic low, 3.8 percent return, your forward earnings are 5.8 percent.</p><p>And your CEO, you buy your stock back. You make your stock go up. You pay more money in dividends to your shareholders --</p><p>CAVUTO: No, Craig, you are absolutely right. But here is the flip side why people kind of like this perverse as it sounds that in this environment there is no way the Federal Reserve will hike rates. You will still be able to play this game where you borrow low and buy whatever and that this will kind of keep this slow-moving puppy going. What do you think?</p><p>SMITH: If --</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>SMITH: If investors don't start looking at other markets that are now starting to use QE to do the same thing because if you see Europe do this, you're going to see a bunch of money leave America and go to Europe looking for the same return --</p><p>CAVUTO: So does that hit the Nasdaq as well? A lot of people have been saying that's a tech bubble there.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not sure it's a tech bubble because this time they have earnings. You know, before the last tech bubble, companies open up. They never had any earnings or any profits and went from zero to $200 per share.</p><p>But Neil, we don't have the underlying economic strength to support this and that is why I wish Mr. Barack Obama would get out of the way and let free enterprise work. I really do.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Craig, good seeing you again.</p><p>SMITH: Good seeing you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Great info. Craig Smith, the Swiss America Trading Corp chairman, as I said, the inspiration for the captain in \"The Titanic.\"</p><p>All right, well, more than two years after Sandy, all the money that never made it to the victims. Now we know. Don't say that I didn't warn you then. Several Republican lawmakers want to wait until they know exactly where each dollar is going.</p><p>Now before you start saying this sounds cruel and awful, think of all the money we have wasted not tracking it, the money that went to Haiti to help them out and that never really help them out, the money that went post- Katrina that never helped anyone out in Louisiana.</p><p>You know, I hate to say it, but this is a one-time I wish that I was wrong.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: There is only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims, the House Majority and their Speaker John Boehner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor Chris Christie was not the inspiration for \"Godzilla,\" just a point of reference, although the movie was twice a hit, back then the governor wasn't exactly feeling the love for the guy he said was holding up all of that dough.</p><p>Now a lot of folks are asking what really was the rush, a top FEMA official now admitting government-backed insurers have been fudging data to deny flood insurance settlements, and even knew about it for over a year, and they dare castigated this guy? Michael Brown not at all surprised. Michael, what do you make of this?</p><p>MICHAEL BROWN, FORMER FEMA DIRECTOR: Neil, you have heard of crony capitalism, ask yourself a simple question, why do we have flood insurance that's subsidized and paid for by the taxpayers? Why do we not have tornado insurance, hurricane insurance, ice storm insurance, thunderstorm insurance?</p><p>It's because the insurance companies somehow convinced Congress decades ago that they didn't want to deal with the actuarial problems and the repetitive claims you had the flood insurance so they pond that off onto FEMA.</p><p>And so now you have a program that for decades even while I was at FEMA was problematic. It's not actuarially sound. Congress is always interfering and telling people you should pay these claims or you can't charge this premium. It is a perfect example of a program that should be in the private sector and the government shouldn't have its hands anywhere near it.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what was FEMA's role in this? Is it mistaken, deliberate, just dumb, what?</p><p>BROWN: Yes, all of the above. I think there's probably everything going on, Neil. I think there are probably some folks that work in the National Flood Insurance Program where these kinds of fraudulent claims just went passed them. They just didn't notice it.</p><p>You may have some people within FEMA who deliberately were in cahoots with some of these engineering companies and insurance companies. And then you have the leadership who goes on another program and says to themselves, I've been here three weeks and this is something that should have been brought to us.</p><p>Well, that is a systemic problem within the government when you have those kinds of programs. It just shouldn't be in the government in the first place.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but we know either directly or indirectly through FEMA and all of these other federal sources, $60 billion was allocated to deal with Sandy.</p><p>And you know, talking to friends and those who were affected in Statin Island, much of New Jersey, I'm not saying that none of them got it, but not nearly the number you would think. There are people to this day, Mike, still waiting for this stuff. What does that say?</p><p>BROWN: It says that government is inherently incapable of doing what Americans for I think the wrong reasons have come to expect the government to do and that's to come in and rebuild their lives for them.</p><p>Look, I have the deepest sympathy for people whose lives are upended by Mother Nature or a man-made disaster, but at the end of the day, people have to recognize that government isn't going to be the answer.</p><p>The answer is going to be to make sure you have your own insurance, to make sure that you are prepared for those disasters and make sure that you can recover from them as quickly as possible and if you're waiting on somebody inside the beltway to take care of you, you're just being foolish.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm still waiting for Governor Christie or now Governor Cuomo, and these others to come out and simply say we were wrong. I'd love to hear that.</p><p>BROWN: Neil, you know, we're close to the ten-year anniversary of Katrina and there are still problems there in New Orleans so you know, welcome to the club.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, but I'll tell you what? I know I told you this before, Michael, they jumped to point the finger at you. Something far more egregious what happened here. No one says boo. That is ridiculous.</p><p>BROWN: Yes, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO: Michael Brown, thank you very, very so much, the former FEMA director. Who, if you want to know the accurate story, warned about everything that ultimately did happen with Katrina.</p><p>Anyway, the Supreme Court is taking up Obamacare again. The media says this is another conservative attack. So then why are doctors and patients scrambling to fend off a premium attack?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS: I'm Maria Bartiromo. Actress and producer, Goldie Hawn on equal pay in Hollywood and how it is blocking some movies from being made. OPENING BELL at 9 a.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO: In tonight's Biz Blitz. Obamacare take \"D,\" the Supreme Court once again taking off an argument that cuts to the Affordable Care Act's core, those subsidies that help folks buy it.</p><p>Do the justices buy it or will they rule that any subsidy violates the constitution and just junk it or throw it in Congress' lap. Remember it's those subsidies that get people in so what happens if that carrot goes?</p><p>That is pretty much at the heart of Republicans arguments and why they took it to the high court. To Jared Levy and Lizzie Macdonald, why a ruling in their favor could actually put Republicans in a very sticky position, Lizzie, what do you think?</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS: You know, I'll tell you something. No less than nine times in the Affordable Care Act does it say that the tax breaks or credits were meant for states that built their own exchanges, period. That's what it says.</p><p>It did not say the IRS is allowed to define the law after the fact and make up rules and regulations ad hoc after-the-fact. And I'll tell you something, even though they are saying chaos, the world is going to hell in a handbasket, you can get catastrophic insurance interim if this law falls apart at the Supreme Court level.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now let's say that these are unconstitutional, what do Republicans do because it would be thrown back in their lap? All right, that's a find mess you got us into. Premiums are soaring. Costs are soaring and it's all because you guys are protesting. What do you think, Jared?</p><p>JARED LEVY, PROFITABLE TRADING.COM SENIOR STRATEGIST: It's funny. It is a really selfish choice when you think about it because on one hand, yes, you have this act, which is now putting insurance companies in control of the ways that we get treated as patients, personally, professionally, I've experienced nothing but bad things.</p><p>But you're right. If Republicans do over throw this, if we do breakdown the subsidies in 34 states and if people don't get their subsidies, you got 7.5 million people who aren't voting for a GOP candidate next election. That's a guarantee just about so again I'd like to see it repealed, but it does hurt the GOP if indeed that does happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Al right, Jared was quoting Sophie's choice, but this was actually inspiration for the movie \"The Scarlet Letter.\" Meanwhile, something to cushion a fired CEO, McDonald's is paying its ousted boss, Don Thompson, $3 million as a consultant, which is about three times more than the salary of his successor.</p><p>It's true. While the new guy is still a 69 percent pay, the salary part of that is 1.1 million, he gets things cooking, he could be getting another $1 million to $1.5 million incentive, but Lizzie, that is still not equal to the pay of the guy that he replaced.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, this is quite a happy meal that McDonald's is giving its exiting CEO. The golden arch is giving quite a golden parachute to a guy who oversaw a sales slide in the U.S. but less is less, and now two years, he is a consultant.</p><p>And lo and behold, you just saw the other news that McDonald's is finally saying that we are going to take antibiotics out of our meat products. Well, guess, what Panero Bread and Chipotle already did that.</p><p>You know, I mentioned, Chipotle, McDonald's should never spun it off. It's now worth a fifth of its entire market cap -- so I don't know what's going on here. I don't why you pay the guy more money who didn't really do such a great job improving McDonald's.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, we keep referencing movies here and while this guy is going to remain a consultant of McDonald's, I was, everything is going to be disclosed here and consulted. Jared, what do you think of this?</p><p>LEVY: All right, so first of all, Thompson was there for 25 years so I think he's staying on as a consultant as an exit strategy is smart. Paying him $3 million not so much, but it's interesting though, you look at from a stock perspective.</p><p>The stocks knocking on new 52-week highs and while that is a lot of the way that we measure this, I think a lot of it is just a happy meal that investors should be given. There is a lot of hope here that this new CEO, Easterbrook, is going to change things.</p><p>So we have to talk about this from this perspective. I do not think that McDonald's is a smart bet right now. I think that it moves lower before it continues back on its meteoric rise.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, onto issue three here, guys, after talking millions and saving pennies, we have been getting it. Those pennies that Americans were saving with the lower gas prices are not translating into a billion-dollar boon for corporations, more like a hit, a bad hit.</p><p>We are telling you how Target is laying off folks. It's a clear sign customers are not spending it. Apparently, they are worried about savings accounts. What's got them worried, Lizzie?</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you know, what's got them worried, there are other analysts out there, debt and record levels near the $12 trillion that never really came down. They are worried about, you know, health care costs going up so according to the conference board just a fifth of the consumers are going out to retail stores to buy things, doing things like paying their debt and sucking it away for health care.</p><p>CAVUTO: The customers still looks pretty wobbly to me, Jared, should we worry?</p><p>LEVY: I don't know about worry all around. I think we need to do is dissect this a little bit deeper. First of all, \"Consumer Reports\" came out with a great report, great story about how consumers habits of change.</p><p>They are buying bigger stuff. They are buying cars, washing machines, stuff that's fixed. They are not buying a lot of little trinket and stuff like Target may sell, right?</p><p>So maybe look to sort of big appliance companies from an investment perspective, but watch some of the retailers that cater to some of the more frivolous if you will.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, where are they going, dollar store, and these kinds of cheap alternatives?</p><p>MACDONALD: It seems that way and they are buying -- Jared is right. They are buying groceries. They are not to the retailers or certainly the luxury retailers. And you know what, they are kind of buying cars, but they are definitely not going to the mall to the department stores.</p><p>CAVUTO: Jared, if that keeps up, though, the theory is that you -- the big items that you could buy, but eventually that well runs dry.</p><p>LEVY: There is a compounding problem there, right, as the dollar rises, all of the Europeans and Asians coming are spending their money on the high-end products, now we have the double effect and so I think that yes, potentially, we could see this move lower in a lot of the high-end retailers. So this is a sector by sector thing and I don't think it will cause an economic crisis anytime soon.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to thank you both very much.</p><p>In the meantime, take a look at this, it's an Apple spaceship. I want you to find out which tech companies are giving Apple a ship?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: To a tech takeover, if you are impressed with Apple spaceship campus, get a load of Google's plans for a tented city, a fully functional headquarters complete with running tracks and restaurants, and did I mention, it's all climate controlled.</p><p>Google is not alone. By the way, tech titans like LinkedIn and Facebook also on a real estate buying binge prepping pricey headquarters to cook up new inventions. So what the tech are they planning? Find out tomorrow, the hottest news segment in all of cable news.</p><p>Every day we bring you the latest, the coolest before anyone else is talking about it. A way for you to profit off of it and not just because it might have been the inspiration for Tom Cruise in vanilla sky, that's up to you. That's up to you. Run with it.

Forget about ever really doing it, we can't even fake doing it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everyone. Glad to have you. I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And talk about a \"House of Cards\", literally, because the fictional president on that fictional NetFlix show takes a fictional stab at entitlement spending and liberal blogs are going seriously nuts. But even more seriously nuts when I bring up the ridiculous reaction to this utterly ridiculous, totally made-up issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP - \"YOUR WORLD\", YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO: The Huffington Post detailing how Underwood's goal of zero unemployment is impossible and that even if he did get there, inflation would get out of control everywhere.</p><p>This tell you all you need to know, that even cutting entitlements on a fake show with a fake president gets this type of real irate response. This is Rome in the final days.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP - \"YOUR WORLD\", YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, you can almost guess what happens next - angry Liberals jumping on moi for them jumping on this.</p><p>This headline on a very popular media website summed it up. \"Fox's Cavuto Proudly Stands with the President (No, Not Obama)\". The writer goes on to explain that I was seriously rushing to a fake President Underwood's defense.</p><p>Newsflash! I wasn't rushing to anyone's defense, just wondering why so many were taking offense over something that wasn't real and a President and a whole storyline that are totally made-up. It didn't matter. I was just seriously evil.</p><p>I want you to take a look at just some of the responses.</p><p>Like this one: \"Figures Cavuto loves Frank Underwood more than Barack Obama...\"</p><p>Then this: \"Fake President for a fake news channel.\"</p><p>This one I personally like: \"Pravda and Tass are models for Fox News.\"</p><p>And then this one: \"Cavuto's a troll and a midget ogre.\" I have no idea what that means.</p><p>\"Obviously, Cavuto's OK letting our poor suffer. He makes Underwood look like Lincoln.\"</p><p>Then this: \"What a heartless bastard this fat Fox fake is... all for cutting entitlements any way he can.\" Who are you calling \"fat\"?</p><p>Anyway, \"Most people are aware that Repubs suffer Schizophrenia..\", I forgot, \"..mixed with racism...\", I forgot that too, \"...it's a dangerous combo.\"</p><p>Then this: \"Underwood's cut to entitlements fund a $500 billion stimulus program. Cavuto didn't mention that.\"</p><p>Well, actually, I did mention that but who needs facts on something that's fake and thank God for at least some viewers who did know what I was getting at.</p><p>Like this guy: \"This headline is so deceptive. The Fox host was ranting about a fictional character being taken seriously by left-wing websites and somehow he is defending him? This website is growing worse day by day.\"</p><p>Now, there were a lot of other emails like that last one. In fact, most emails were like that last one. But my point here wasn't to make me look good. I don't have to.</p><p>Anyway, my other point though was to quite seriously take a look at how difficult it is to ever get a handle on real entitlement reform because even when we're discussing a fake show, my God, we can't even fake it. And if that's the case, we really are a financial 'House of Cards'.</p><p>To political watcher Steve Moore, Sabrina Schaeffer, Julie Roginsky.</p><p>Steve, what do you think?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, Neil, it is a (INAUDIBLE) fake character and it is a fake show. But you know what? It's not a fake crisis. This entitlement time bomb that is (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: You're feeding the beast, Moore. You're feeding the beast.</p><p>MOORE: Well, you had it exactly right. This is a real crisis. Ten thousand Americans are retiring every day. They're going on Medicare. They're going on social security. This is the Titanic headed right towards the iceberg. And shame on you for saying maybe we should start turning that ship away from the iceberg. But you're right on.</p><p>CAVUTO: But here's the thing, Sabrina. I mean, even when a fake show lobs this up, silly as it was, it gets this type of reaction. People are seriously all worked-up about it. So Sabrina, my worry with this is if we can't even get to it on a fake entitlement address, how are we ever going to get serious about it?</p><p>SABRINA SCHAEFFER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, here's the thing, Neil, and this is where the writers got Frank Underwood totally wrong. Democrats would never have released something like Frank Underwood does on this AmWorks program without intensive persuasion messaging research. Frank Underwood would never have just talked about entitlement reform the way he did in that meeting in that scene in the show. In fact, the Independent Women's Forum did conduct a randomized controlled experiment to figure out how do we talk about it and talking about entitlement reform is not the sort of bomb that we're thinking it is. In fact, when you talk about cutting spending or to preserve entitlements, Americans are strongly behind it. They're strongly behind constraining our budget and as well as reforming entitlements and that's good news.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. My worry with this, Julie, is that we take at face value that anything that comes up there (INAUDIBLE) by that definition, on a fake show, in \"Planet of the Apes\". I guess the subliminal messages - we're not careful, this is us in just a few decades. I mean, we've got to get serious.</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC PARTY STRATEGIST: You know why I'm so mad at you and your producers right now? I was sitting in my office minding my own business. They sent me this clip and they said, \"Do you want to do the show today?\" and you totally ruined the \"House of Cards\" for me. I was going to spend this weekend watching it and then you spoiled the whole thing. So--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I didn't give away how he - how he addresses this. I just--</p><p>ROGINSKY: I don't want to talk about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: --told you what one episode is about.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I have made people keep their mouths shut for a week and you ruined my day. Thank you very much. Look, I actually agree with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know it's fiction because it's a Democrats' series about a budget so you know it's fiction.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes. I forgot the last Democrat that actually gave us a balanced - oh, OK. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Touche, young lady.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes, yes. Touche. His name was (INAUDIBLE). His name - his name was Bill Clinton, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO: But even you, Julie - Julie, come on. Julie, even you - and I think Bill Clinton would take offense to everyone getting hyper about it.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I agree. Actually, I agree with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You agree, right?</p><p>ROGINSKY: Totally. This is insane.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So Steve, she agrees. Democrats and Repubs are on the same page: \"Everyone, lighten up.\" What say you?</p><p>MOORE: Well, look, first of all, I didn't even know Underwood was President so that's how far behind I am on this stuff. But - so thanks a lot. No, but look, here's the point. We know this. We have tens of trillions - that's trillions with a \"T\" - of unfunded liabilities in these programs. If we don't fix them, Neil, whether it's fictionally or in real life, we're going to end up - this country's going to end up like Detroit, in bankruptcy court.</p><p>CAVUTO: But even mentioning them on a fictitious show and what worries me- -.</p><p>MOORE: Well, that's the whole point.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: But again, you know--.</p><p>MOORE: But you know, Millennials like - Millennials do want to fix these programs.</p><p>CAVUTO: I agree. I agree. But I should (INAUDIBLE) to our audience that in \"Dr. DoLittle\", the animals do not really talk. I just want them to be aware of that. They do not really talk. Although some of them I think could if pushed.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I also don't think the President's killed two people with his own hands in the history of this country but I may be wrong about that. Frank Underwood's done a lot worse than (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know about that. I don't know about that.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I don't think he's pushed anybody from the D.C. metro anytime but I may be wrong about that.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Let me add though that I don't think this is a political disaster either. I think that - I hope that people will take a look at the research that we did on this issue because it's not a lose-lose. It's a - there's a win politically and there's a win policy-wise. We have to deal with this issue because the pay-as-you-go system as Steve acknowledges is no longer working and--. But I think Americans are more behind reforming this. It's a matter of how do we talk about it in a way that makes people comfortable, it makes people realize that we're actually trying to preserve these systems for the future.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well-said.</p><p>Guys, I want to thank you all. One other footnote to make - a lot of you who were confused whether the Linda Blair character in \"Exorcist\" was built on Nancy Pelosi. That one, you're right. That was in fact, the case.</p><p>Just lighten up, everyone. Lighten up.</p><p>Meanwhile, fake or real, it really doesn't matter because if these ladies are right, no one is serious about government spending at all, least of all, get this, Republicans.</p><p>To columnist Gina Loudon, Katherine Timf who say perish the thought.</p><p>What - Gina, what's going on here? Republicans are giving up the fight?</p><p>GINA LOUDON, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: This is my question I really want to know how to answer. I speak around probably like you do to audiences of true patriots who elected this leadership and put them where they are and they are expecting some accountability. This is really what it comes down to. How do you answer the question? If Boehner was going to cave on this, Neil, why didn't he cave a week ago, just before that? Why didn't he - why did he wait until it was truly a war--.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you're angry (INAUDIBLE) dropped the ball again? 'Cause he did try their idea first and it fell through, right, (INAUDIBLE) the votes.</p><p>LOUDON: But when you - when you pit yourself against someone who you say, \"This is a fight\", and you lay down--. Let me ask you something. When's the last time they didn't lay down?</p><p>CAVUTO: I ask the questions around here, lady. What do you think this is? NetFlix?</p><p>LOUDON: When is the last time they didn't lay down? When is the last time you ever saw Boehner actually win a fight? When? I've never seen it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, now, Katherine, she's (INAUDIBLE) because whether you agree or disagree, there are quite a few like her who are not copacetic with the mainstream party and how it handles this stuff.</p><p>KATHERINE TIMPF, NATIONAL REVIEW COLUMNIST: Right. If you look at what he said towards the beginning, just like you said, he came out saying, \"Watch out, Obama. You can't do this\" and he can't. He actually can't. The executive order on the immigration--</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, so did President Underwood. You know where that--.</p><p>TIMPF: --not able to do that. But the thing is even on a branding level, they're not doing a great job because right now, the Democrats are saying, \"See how far the Republicans were willing to go because of how racist they are and they hate this immigration law.\" When really, it was about the fact that it's not constitutional. So there are so many issues here.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, wait, I got no emails on that - that Republicans are racist- -.</p><p>TIMPF: If you look at liberal internet, they're saying, \"See, they're so racist. They would let terrorists invade us and defunding the DHS\" which, by the way, this is the only time I've ever heard them concerned about ISIS at all now that it's political.</p><p>CAVUTO: All of a sudden, they're concerned.</p><p>LOUDON: Right. Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Gina, I mean, your argument is we've got to be very close to understanding the threats that faces financial otherwise, and that Republicans have to be looking at that in their nominee whoever that is. If it were a Jeb Bush, if it were a Chris Christie, what would Gina Loudon do?</p><p>LOUDON: Well, I'll tell you, this administration has put us all in a mindset of we've got to have someone who isn't Barack Obama and certainly isn't Hillary or any of the selections that we're seeing come out of their camp. So we do - people in this country are worried about economic security and national security. That is number one on their mind that's paramount to the voters and that's not just conservatives. That is across the board when you talk (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But you don't like the guys I mentioned earlier?</p><p>LOUDON: I'm not - those aren't my number one choices. No. But I will say this - why instead - what has got to happen from the GOP and I still don't understand it is messaging, messaging, messaging and you alluded to this. You - why - instead of laying down again - didn't they just get on the messaging horse and just win this? The argument was so very simple and understandable for the average American and instead, they just kind of cower.</p><p>CAVUTO: Here's where I give them the benefit of the doubt. No, no. Here's where - I understand what you're saying but Katherine, they have to get through the mainstream media that will never cut them a break, that will call them - as you say - \"racist\", (INAUDIBLE) \"You're going to shut down government\" when we know in that case, that was never what this was going to be about. But they have to get through that. How do they?</p><p>TIMPF: They really do. Well, maybe they need to think about it before they go blazing saddles out with something like this. I don't know why they chose the DHS.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, blazing saddles was not a real (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. Yes. Wait, what?</p><p>CAVUTO: Was not a real event.</p><p>TIMPF: I have so many political opinions about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: The budget might be blazing but I digress.</p><p>TIMPF: But they came out and they weren't prepared to fight it to the end. And I don't know why they chose the DHS, like I was saying, rather than Department of Education. Of course DHS' mostly agencies that actually fight terrorism aren't even under that umbrella necessarily--.</p><p>CAVUTO: But that was interesting. Then all of a sudden, they were - the Democrats were concerned about terror.</p><p>TIMPF: All of a sudden, they're saying, \"(INAUDIBLE) the DHS. But ISIS is going to invade us immediately if we even partially defund it.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: But Republicans dug themselves in that pit, didn't they?</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>LOUDON: So all they had to say was \"Look, this is 15 percent of employees who have mostly desk jobs.\" So somebody not playing Solitaire at their desk next week is not going affect Homeland Security. Let's be real about this.</p><p>CAVUTO: They're not all playing Solitaire. Some of them are on porn. Now, so, what do Republicans do right now? What's done is done, what's gone is gone?</p><p>TIMPF: It's humiliating. They need to find something that they all agree on and stand behind that and do it. 'Cause right now, they had this majority and it doesn't even matter because they can't agree on anything, it seems like. So they need to prove that they're powerful and not just reactive to everything.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gina?</p><p>LOUDON: I agree. They've got to stand. The Republicans have better - look at Reagan. He just stood and he convinced the country he was right. That's leadership. Look at (INAUDIBLE). He stands.</p><p>CAVUTO: But he also budged on - he raised taxes in 1986. They were still lower than they were when he took office but he was good at negotiating.</p><p>LOUDON: He was big at leading. People need a leader in this country. We are - we are looking at all the threats - North Korea, of course, Iran, so on and so forth, and we're watching as other leaders around the country lead and the leaders in this country including the Republican leaders right now are refusing to lead. They're making commitments. They're making strong stands. And then they're backing down or they're just cowering to start. It's a very scary place to be right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you're saying that a guy who started as an actor in movies was in fact a real leader?</p><p>LOUDON: He was in fact a real leader.</p><p>CAVUTO: Take that, Underwood.</p><p>LOUDON: That brings it full circle.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know we're going to get emails on this show. People, lighten up!</p><p>All right. In the meantime, the IRS is singing the budget blues. Now, who exactly is singing yours?</p><p>CAVUTO: Talk about taxing and the IRS complaining. Now, well, you've already heard how the agency's been whining about budget cuts that has supposedly compromised its ability to audit you. But now, the Treasury's chiming in to say those same cuts are going to create even more headaches for you. They might not be able to get refunds out as fast or administer the financial part of the health care law that's their responsibility as well.</p><p>Well, compared to what? Is it me or is the government more concerned about - well - its own tax headaches than your tax headaches, your burdens, your rules to which you better comply, your myriad of new tax forms that you better fill out. Never mind you're overwhelmed, the Treasury Secretary says it's a bigger deal because they are?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP - WASHINGTON, DC, YESTERDAY)</p><p>JACK LEW, TREASURY SECRETARY: A sustained deterioration in taxpayer service combined with reduced enforcement activity presents serious long- term risks for the U.S. tax system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP - WASHINGTON, DC, YESTERDAY)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, he did not play the role of the quiet man. That was John Wayne. That's Treasury Secretary Lew.</p><p>Anyway, forget the long-term risks for the U.S. tax system. CATO tax policy analyst Dan Mitchell worries more about the long-term risks for the U.S. taxpayer.</p><p>Dan, I think they've got it (INAUDIBLE) backwards here but fill me in on what you think.</p><p>DAN MITCHELL, CATO TAX POLICY ANALYST: If you look at the IRS budget numbers over the last 30 years, you'll see that even after adjusting for inflation, the IRS has almost twice as big of a budget now as they did 30 years ago. Now, it's not as high as the peak in 2010 when all the fake stimulus money was being thrown around in Washington and every agency was drowning in taxpayer money there, their budgets were so blown-up. But the notion that we should feel sorry for the IRS and somehow we're not going to get the right service from the IRS reminds me of the country boys I knew in college who talked about bulls servicing cows. Hey, if the IRS leaves us alone, I'll be perfectly happy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Careful, there's a movie about that too but I'll think of it - \"Deliverance\". (INAUDIBLE). Here's what worries me, Dan, that what they're trying to say is if you're not getting this or you're waiting for this, they're telegraphing it, they're doing some pre-hiney-covering and that worries me too. What else aren't they saying? Or what else potentially are they bracing us for?</p><p>MITCHELL: The IRS has almost a 100,000 employees. As I've said, their budget is almost twice as big adjusted for inflation as it was 30 years ago. The notion that they're claiming that they somehow can't competently enforce the tax code? Well, maybe if they didn't spend so much money participating in an illegal rewrite of the Obamacare law, maybe if they weren't trying to influence American elections by political biased approval of different nonprofit groups, maybe if they just focused on their core mission, they would have plenty of money to enforce the tax code. And I say this as someone who doesn't necessarily blame the IRS because it's the politicians that have given us the 76.000-page tax code and that of course is a burden, not just on us but the IRS doesn't know how to enforce that either.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, if any of you at the IRS are watching this segment right now, Dan is the one saying all of these horrible stuff. I think you're just doing a fine job myself. But Dan, here's another thing that kind of interests me on all of this. To be fair to the IRS, they have the financial burden of doing a lot of the financial part of the health care law. Now, I thought we hired 60,000 IRS agents to do this and that that was going to be enough to cover it. It seems to me that Treasury Secretary Lew who was not John Wayne in \"The Quiet Man\" - just so people at home would know - understand that might not be enough or what?</p><p>MITCHELL: We definitely have one of these - what - immovable objects, irresistible force conflicts because the tax code is such a mess and because things like Obamacare are now supposed to be enforced by the IRS, we have to fundamentally choose. Do we either basically give massive power and massive (INAUDIBLE) budgets to the IRS and basically let them tell us how to live our lives? Or do we basically resist and tell the politicians, \"No, we've had enough\"? We don't like the fact that our lives are being looked into. We don't like the fact that we have no privacy. We don't like the fact that we give up our constitutional presumption of innocence when dealing with the IRS. Maybe you guys in Washington on Capitol Hill and the White House need to fix some of the mess in the tax code. As far as I'm concerned, I would much rather force them to change the tax code than to simply give more money to the IRS to try to prop up a system that - if we leave it on autopilot, we're going to wind up being Greece.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Dan. Thank you very much. For those who don't know at home, Dan was the inspiration for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\"</p><p>In the meantime, still calling them Blackburied? \"What the Tech?!\", someone forgot to tell Blackberry.</p><p>CAVUTO: Blackberry is branching out. Ford is biking out. And Dominos and Pizza Hut with gizmos to help you order out. We're here to figure them all out on the hottest new segment in all of cable news because \"What the Tech?!\" is here and all of your tech questions are answered each night, every night. If it's a digit, dig it, we are all over it.</p><p>I kind of like that.</p><p>Anyway, long before folks were even talking about it, so hip, so happening, so me, we've already patented the name.</p><p>Now, to tonight's big tech issues.</p><p>First up, Blackberry. Given up for dead but it is still not giving up. The company offering not one, not two, not three, but four new devices aimed at the corporate and government crowd. Sure, they've lost customers but the only ones they still have are rabidly loyal and when it comes to these raised keyboards, obsessively so.</p><p>So what does Mashable's Christina Warren make all of this? Before we get to her, I just want to confirm for all of you, it was not a Blackberry device that was an inspiration in \"Fast Times in Ridgemont High.\" All right? We all clear on that? Very close. Phone - yes, they did have a phone-in order pizza but it was not via Blackberry.</p><p>OK. What do you make of this?</p><p>CHRISTINA WARREN, MASHABLE SENIOR TECH ANALYST: It's not a bad move on Blackberry's part. They're coming out with four new devices. One of them is actually going to be a slider that actually has a keyboard that slides out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Physical keyboard (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WARREN: It will still have (INAUDIBLE) keyboard.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that (INAUDIBLE) what Blackberry (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WARREN: It is not. One other new device is called the \"Leap\" that they announced this week is actually a full touch device and it's going to be fairly low-cost. They're kind of aiming it at the - I guess - early enterprise market kind of--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Would your generation buy that?</p><p>WARREN: No.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why not? You think they've come and gone?</p><p>WARREN: They have. They're not there with the apps. But you know what? They still have a really strong business presence. They're still really known for security. So I think what they're really doing which is smart is they're expanding into being more of a software company. So they're starting to put their software on other products including Android and iOS. And I think that's really their big growth of opportunity. Devices not so much. Like you said, there's still the loyalists, still the people who love them and won't ever give them up.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, I know.</p><p>WARREN: But--</p><p>CAVUTO: They're out there.</p><p>WARREN: They are out there. But for everybody else has moved on.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. This next story was indeed the inspiration for \"Fast Times in Ridgemont High\". This was the one you've got to watch because are you interested in ordering a slice on a smartwatch? Well, Dominos is testing it. Rival Pizza Hut testing something very similar but not on a watch, on a special device in your car.</p><p>Christina, what the tech? What is this? Are we in that much of a rush?</p><p>WARREN: For pizza? Yes. And there's also a new magnet that you put on your fridge and you literally press a button, it orders you pizza.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, sign me up.</p><p>WARREN: No. See, this sounds silly at first, right? Like, do we really need pizza any faster?</p><p>CAVUTO: Not at all. Not to me.</p><p>WARREN: But if you think about it, OK. So take it away from pizza and say, maybe, have laundry pick-up or maybe I can have take-out order or maybe my groceries can be ordered for me. We're getting into the age of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. But what if you have kids that keep hitting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WARREN: That's a good point. That's a good point. It needs security. But we're kind of reaching this age where everything can be automated and customized in such a way that we can do one-touch ordering and it can be delivered the way you want it, when you want it, wherever.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. The kid reference was a reference to \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2\".</p><p>Meanwhile, what the tech?! Ford is peddling bicycles with apparently not just any bicycles, the automaker - at least the last time I checked - is creating a new e-bicycle with navigation sensors. The thing even folds up.</p><p>Christina, does this have like just \"steal me\" written all over it?</p><p>WARREN: It does. It does. But it also has - for me, I'm like \"I want to ride this\" because this looks amazing. They're taking the best of--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, why are they doing it?</p><p>WARREN: Well, a lot of people are not driving these days especially a lot of young people. They look at studies, people are getting their licenses older and people are not getting into cars as much.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is (INAUDIBLE) people are going to - would you ride this?</p><p>WARREN: You know what? I might. Especially that folds up. Say I can use it for GPS navigation with my phone. It can help me pedal if it gets too hard especially when the weather's nicer. Right now, I wouldn't ride a bike.</p><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE). You know? So Ford seems to be covering its (INAUDIBLE). What I noticed in all the pictures they show of it, they have it in a car.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Which I like here it is in a car.</p><p>WARREN: Well, they're saying you drive to the bike track and then you bike around but (INAUDIBLE) you can just bike.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So you think this (INAUDIBLE) that others might follow suit because Google wants to do cars, Ford that does cars wants to do bikes. It just seems weird.</p><p>WARREN: I think they're just trying to kind of cover all their bases. They know that a lot of people especially in urban areas are trying to be more green and are walking more, biking more so why not get into that market while they can?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Thank you.</p><p>This is not from a clip the Andromeda Strain. Very close. Remember, he blew up a bike but it was not that bike. And it was certainly not Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>All right. Now, we know you weren't spending that gas money you were saving. And unfortunately, so do the folks at Target.</p><p>CAVUTO: We are still wondering, but enough about me. Imagine inheriting a thermometer from your parents. You just throw it right out, right? Now imagine that thermometer is 134 years old. It would be harder to get rid of that. Find out what family does with his landmark on \"STRANGE INHERITANCE.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, expect more and pay less, just don't expect help getting that giant bag of toilet paper off the top shelf because Target is planning to cut thousands of its jobs. It's not alone, companies big and small, planning layoffs.</p><p>Market watcher, Craig Smith, who was indeed the inspiration for the captain on the \"Titanic,\" in the movie \"The Titanic\" joins right now. All right, so Craig, what is going on here because a lot of these guys seemed to be repeating the same story.</p><p>CRAIG SMITH, \"DON'T BANK ON IT\" AUTHOR: Isn't that the truth, brick-and- mortar has got some lessons to learn here, Neil, as they walk down through the graveyard JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Radioshack.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I thought consumers were coming back and you were the first to warn, wait a minute, let's not party too soon here.</p><p>CRAIG: Well, yes, and the reason I did not is because the economy hasn't turned around, Neil. Look, I mean, Brian Cornell has his work cut out for him. He is laying off some people, but watch what he is going to do like $2 billion worth of stock back increasing his stock price, creating better dividends.</p><p>I mean, Neil, from Q1 one of 2009 to the last numbers we have, the third quarter of 2014, S&amp;P corporations have bought back $2.1 trillion worth of stocks, Neil --</p><p>CAVUTO: What does that mean?</p><p>SMITH: It means that they are showing great profits because of what they are doing on their balance sheets, but not because they are bringing more people in the stores, not because people are spending more money, and not because they are making more money.</p><p>They are basically doing it by balance sheet corrections. Neil, we cannot see these corporations make big money when we are growing an economy at 2 percent, Neil. It doesn't work.</p><p>CAVUTO: So I'm beginning to wonder and we've seen in income and spending numbers. Income up a little bit and spending down a little bit. This has been a trend of like where consumers, whatever savings they are getting and we will be exploring this a little bit more in the show, they are just not spending it and I wonder whether they see something.</p><p>SMITH: That's an interesting question and I will have to speculate. But Neil, we know for a fact that every penny at the pump means a billion dollars in the economy. We have seen at least $100 billion in gas prices coming into this economy. Where did it go?</p><p>We don't see anybody ripping the cover off the ball other than Apple, which by the way, if my watch goes off, I have a piece on order -- but it's amazing because you know as well as I do and Fox Business has done a great job covering this.</p><p>The underlying economy is not growing at the pace that we need to hold these corporate profits were they are. That is why corporations are buying back their stock. Think about it, if your corporate bond rate is at historic low, 3.8 percent return, your forward earnings are 5.8 percent.</p><p>And your CEO, you buy your stock back. You make your stock go up. You pay more money in dividends to your shareholders --</p><p>CAVUTO: No, Craig, you are absolutely right. But here is the flip side why people kind of like this perverse as it sounds that in this environment there is no way the Federal Reserve will hike rates. You will still be able to play this game where you borrow low and buy whatever and that this will kind of keep this slow-moving puppy going. What do you think?</p><p>SMITH: If --</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>SMITH: If investors don't start looking at other markets that are now starting to use QE to do the same thing because if you see Europe do this, you're going to see a bunch of money leave America and go to Europe looking for the same return --</p><p>CAVUTO: So does that hit the Nasdaq as well? A lot of people have been saying that's a tech bubble there.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm not sure it's a tech bubble because this time they have earnings. You know, before the last tech bubble, companies open up. They never had any earnings or any profits and went from zero to $200 per share.</p><p>But Neil, we don't have the underlying economic strength to support this and that is why I wish Mr. Barack Obama would get out of the way and let free enterprise work. I really do.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Craig, good seeing you again.</p><p>SMITH: Good seeing you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Great info. Craig Smith, the Swiss America Trading Corp chairman, as I said, the inspiration for the captain in \"The Titanic.\"</p><p>All right, well, more than two years after Sandy, all the money that never made it to the victims. Now we know. Don't say that I didn't warn you then. Several Republican lawmakers want to wait until they know exactly where each dollar is going.</p><p>Now before you start saying this sounds cruel and awful, think of all the money we have wasted not tracking it, the money that went to Haiti to help them out and that never really help them out, the money that went post- Katrina that never helped anyone out in Louisiana.</p><p>You know, I hate to say it, but this is a one-time I wish that I was wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: There is only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims, the House Majority and their Speaker John Boehner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor Chris Christie was not the inspiration for \"Godzilla,\" just a point of reference, although the movie was twice a hit, back then the governor wasn't exactly feeling the love for the guy he said was holding up all of that dough.</p><p>Now a lot of folks are asking what really was the rush, a top FEMA official now admitting government-backed insurers have been fudging data to deny flood insurance settlements, and even knew about it for over a year, and they dare castigated this guy? Michael Brown not at all surprised. Michael, what do you make of this?</p><p>MICHAEL BROWN, FORMER FEMA DIRECTOR: Neil, you have heard of crony capitalism, ask yourself a simple question, why do we have flood insurance that's subsidized and paid for by the taxpayers? Why do we not have tornado insurance, hurricane insurance, ice storm insurance, thunderstorm insurance?</p><p>It's because the insurance companies somehow convinced Congress decades ago that they didn't want to deal with the actuarial problems and the repetitive claims you had the flood insurance so they pond that off onto FEMA.</p><p>And so now you have a program that for decades even while I was at FEMA was problematic. It's not actuarially sound. Congress is always interfering and telling people you should pay these claims or you can't charge this premium. It is a perfect example of a program that should be in the private sector and the government shouldn't have its hands anywhere near it.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what was FEMA's role in this? Is it mistaken, deliberate, just dumb, what?</p><p>BROWN: Yes, all of the above. I think there's probably everything going on, Neil. I think there are probably some folks that work in the National Flood Insurance Program where these kinds of fraudulent claims just went passed them. They just didn't notice it.</p><p>You may have some people within FEMA who deliberately were in cahoots with some of these engineering companies and insurance companies. And then you have the leadership who goes on another program and says to themselves, I've been here three weeks and this is something that should have been brought to us.</p><p>Well, that is a systemic problem within the government when you have those kinds of programs. It just shouldn't be in the government in the first place.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but we know either directly or indirectly through FEMA and all of these other federal sources, $60 billion was allocated to deal with Sandy.</p><p>And you know, talking to friends and those who were affected in Statin Island, much of New Jersey, I'm not saying that none of them got it, but not nearly the number you would think. There are people to this day, Mike, still waiting for this stuff. What does that say?</p><p>BROWN: It says that government is inherently incapable of doing what Americans for I think the wrong reasons have come to expect the government to do and that's to come in and rebuild their lives for them.</p><p>Look, I have the deepest sympathy for people whose lives are upended by Mother Nature or a man-made disaster, but at the end of the day, people have to recognize that government isn't going to be the answer.</p><p>The answer is going to be to make sure you have your own insurance, to make sure that you are prepared for those disasters and make sure that you can recover from them as quickly as possible and if you're waiting on somebody inside the beltway to take care of you, you're just being foolish.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm still waiting for Governor Christie or now Governor Cuomo, and these others to come out and simply say we were wrong. I'd love to hear that.</p><p>BROWN: Neil, you know, we're close to the ten-year anniversary of Katrina and there are still problems there in New Orleans so you know, welcome to the club.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, but I'll tell you what? I know I told you this before, Michael, they jumped to point the finger at you. Something far more egregious what happened here. No one says boo. That is ridiculous.</p><p>BROWN: Yes, it is.</p><p>CAVUTO: Michael Brown, thank you very, very so much, the former FEMA director. Who, if you want to know the accurate story, warned about everything that ultimately did happen with Katrina.</p><p>Anyway, the Supreme Court is taking up Obamacare again. The media says this is another conservative attack. So then why are doctors and patients scrambling to fend off a premium attack?</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS: I'm Maria Bartiromo. Actress and producer, Goldie Hawn on equal pay in Hollywood and how it is blocking some movies from being made. OPENING BELL at 9 a.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO: In tonight's Biz Blitz. Obamacare take \"D,\" the Supreme Court once again taking off an argument that cuts to the Affordable Care Act's core, those subsidies that help folks buy it.</p><p>Do the justices buy it or will they rule that any subsidy violates the constitution and just junk it or throw it in Congress' lap. Remember it's those subsidies that get people in so what happens if that carrot goes?</p><p>That is pretty much at the heart of Republicans arguments and why they took it to the high court. To Jared Levy and Lizzie Macdonald, why a ruling in their favor could actually put Republicans in a very sticky position, Lizzie, what do you think?</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS: You know, I'll tell you something. No less than nine times in the Affordable Care Act does it say that the tax breaks or credits were meant for states that built their own exchanges, period. That's what it says.</p><p>It did not say the IRS is allowed to define the law after the fact and make up rules and regulations ad hoc after-the-fact. And I'll tell you something, even though they are saying chaos, the world is going to hell in a handbasket, you can get catastrophic insurance interim if this law falls apart at the Supreme Court level.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now let's say that these are unconstitutional, what do Republicans do because it would be thrown back in their lap? All right, that's a find mess you got us into. Premiums are soaring. Costs are soaring and it's all because you guys are protesting. What do you think, Jared?</p><p>JARED LEVY, PROFITABLE TRADING.COM SENIOR STRATEGIST: It's funny. It is a really selfish choice when you think about it because on one hand, yes, you have this act, which is now putting insurance companies in control of the ways that we get treated as patients, personally, professionally, I've experienced nothing but bad things.</p><p>But you're right. If Republicans do over throw this, if we do breakdown the subsidies in 34 states and if people don't get their subsidies, you got 7.5 million people who aren't voting for a GOP candidate next election. That's a guarantee just about so again I'd like to see it repealed, but it does hurt the GOP if indeed that does happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Al right, Jared was quoting Sophie's choice, but this was actually inspiration for the movie \"The Scarlet Letter.\" Meanwhile, something to cushion a fired CEO, McDonald's is paying its ousted boss, Don Thompson, $3 million as a consultant, which is about three times more than the salary of his successor.</p><p>It's true. While the new guy is still a 69 percent pay, the salary part of that is 1.1 million, he gets things cooking, he could be getting another $1 million to $1.5 million incentive, but Lizzie, that is still not equal to the pay of the guy that he replaced.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, this is quite a happy meal that McDonald's is giving its exiting CEO. The golden arch is giving quite a golden parachute to a guy who oversaw a sales slide in the U.S. but less is less, and now two years, he is a consultant.</p><p>And lo and behold, you just saw the other news that McDonald's is finally saying that we are going to take antibiotics out of our meat products. Well, guess, what Panero Bread and Chipotle already did that.</p><p>You know, I mentioned, Chipotle, McDonald's should never spun it off. It's now worth a fifth of its entire market cap -- so I don't know what's going on here. I don't why you pay the guy more money who didn't really do such a great job improving McDonald's.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, we keep referencing movies here and while this guy is going to remain a consultant of McDonald's, I was, everything is going to be disclosed here and consulted. Jared, what do you think of this?</p><p>LEVY: All right, so first of all, Thompson was there for 25 years so I think he's staying on as a consultant as an exit strategy is smart. Paying him $3 million not so much, but it's interesting though, you look at from a stock perspective.</p><p>The stocks knocking on new 52-week highs and while that is a lot of the way that we measure this, I think a lot of it is just a happy meal that investors should be given. There is a lot of hope here that this new CEO, Easterbrook, is going to change things.</p><p>So we have to talk about this from this perspective. I do not think that McDonald's is a smart bet right now. I think that it moves lower before it continues back on its meteoric rise.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, onto issue three here, guys, after talking millions and saving pennies, we have been getting it. Those pennies that Americans were saving with the lower gas prices are not translating into a billion-dollar boon for corporations, more like a hit, a bad hit.</p><p>We are telling you how Target is laying off folks. It's a clear sign customers are not spending it. Apparently, they are worried about savings accounts. What's got them worried, Lizzie?</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you know, what's got them worried, there are other analysts out there, debt and record levels near the $12 trillion that never really came down. They are worried about, you know, health care costs going up so according to the conference board just a fifth of the consumers are going out to retail stores to buy things, doing things like paying their debt and sucking it away for health care.</p><p>CAVUTO: The customers still looks pretty wobbly to me, Jared, should we worry?</p><p>LEVY: I don't know about worry all around. I think we need to do is dissect this a little bit deeper. First of all, \"Consumer Reports\" came out with a great report, great story about how consumers habits of change.</p><p>They are buying bigger stuff. They are buying cars, washing machines, stuff that's fixed. They are not buying a lot of little trinket and stuff like Target may sell, right?</p><p>So maybe look to sort of big appliance companies from an investment perspective, but watch some of the retailers that cater to some of the more frivolous if you will.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, where are they going, dollar store, and these kinds of cheap alternatives?</p><p>MACDONALD: It seems that way and they are buying -- Jared is right. They are buying groceries. They are not to the retailers or certainly the luxury retailers. And you know what, they are kind of buying cars, but they are definitely not going to the mall to the department stores.</p><p>CAVUTO: Jared, if that keeps up, though, the theory is that you -- the big items that you could buy, but eventually that well runs dry.</p><p>LEVY: There is a compounding problem there, right, as the dollar rises, all of the Europeans and Asians coming are spending their money on the high-end products, now we have the double effect and so I think that yes, potentially, we could see this move lower in a lot of the high-end retailers. So this is a sector by sector thing and I don't think it will cause an economic crisis anytime soon.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to thank you both very much.</p><p>In the meantime, take a look at this, it's an Apple spaceship. I want you to find out which tech companies are giving Apple a ship?</p><p>CAVUTO: To a tech takeover, if you are impressed with Apple spaceship campus, get a load of Google's plans for a tented city, a fully functional headquarters complete with running tracks and restaurants, and did I mention, it's all climate controlled.</p><p>Google is not alone. By the way, tech titans like LinkedIn and Facebook also on a real estate buying binge prepping pricey headquarters to cook up new inventions. So what the tech are they planning? Find out tomorrow, the hottest news segment in all of cable news.</p><p>Every day we bring you the latest, the coolest before anyone else is talking about it. A way for you to profit off of it and not just because it might have been the inspiration for Tom Cruise in vanilla sky, that's up to you. That's up to you. Run with it.

Ant's $1.2 billion bid for Dallas-based money transfer service MoneyGram International is under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius). Ant Financial is \"on track to be the world's largest fintech company,\" Mubayi said.</p><p>Investors are understandably excited about Ant Financial's prospects and plans ahead of its public listing, tipped for next year. The IPO has the potential to be the largest fundraising ever by a fintech innovator.</p><p>Ant Financial will still be 33% owned by Alibaba if the company is listed in the future, according to Alibaba's annual report.</p><p>Ant Financial is already estimated to be worth more than $70.5 billion, according to equity analysts at Goldman Sachs; bigger than the market capitalisation of Swiss bank UBS.</p><p>First developed as an online payment system for Alibaba's internet marketplace, its Alipay mobile payment platform has expanded into the physical world, enabling users to make payments instantly by scanning the QR codes in their smart phone.</p><p>It took a step further on September 1, deploying its facial recognition payment system \"Smile to Pay\" at a Yum China restaurant in its hometown of Hangzhou.</p><p>Chen also addressed fears that Ant's online money fund Yu'e Bao, meaning leftover treasure, has grown so large it poses a systemic risk.</p><p>The following transcript of the conversation has been edited for clarity.</p><p>Q Which areas of finance overseas offer the most promising opportunities for digital disruption and growth for Ant Financial? A There is so much that can be done in payments, wealth management, consumer loans, SME [small-and medium-sized enterprise] loans and insurance.</p><p>Finance is so far from being inclusive that we see blue ocean everywhere.</p><p>In the US, payments are very out dated, even though it is the most advanced financial system in the world.</p><p>People should have their own balance sheet to manage their financial life. It will come and it will come fast.</p><p>Finance will be democratised, just like at Yu'e Bao. You have just one yuan? You can still grow it. At a traditional bank if you only have a little money, then who is going to talk to you? Q What will you do with MoneyGram if Ant's acquisition is approved? A I can't discuss that but what I can say is that international cross border payments cost up to 7% globally - more than twice as high as it needs to be.</p><p>Q What are your plans for growing \"Smile to Pay\"? A There are different ways to complete payments. One of them is facial technology, but it's not clear if it will become the most widely used way to complete payments in the future.</p><p>The key yardstick is the users' experience.</p><p>We started with QR code payments [scannable codes that resemble square mazes], which became extremely popular.</p><p>When Apple Pay came out with its version of NFC [near field communications] payments there was quite some excitement, but it is far from being the major player.</p><p>Whatever payment method is most widely used will evolve the fastest and dominate payments.</p><p>Safety is not the major concern for payments - because transactions are already very safe, thanks to our AI-driven risk management system.</p><p>Our fraud loss rate is already lower than 1 in 1 million, meaning that for every one million dollars there is one dollar of loss.</p><p>That is better than bank debit or credit cards in China. Their official average loss rate is estimated to be about two basis points [0.02%]. Also bear in mind that China's bank loss rate is low compared with the rest of the world.</p><p>Q Don't people worry about privacy? Will this hamper Ant Financial's development? A Privacy and data security are the building blocks of the digital age. People kind of assume in the big data age that their data will be detected and watched, but that is not the case.</p><p>Any data that is collected has to be authorised. Then before any one can use it the data has to go through desensitisation, which means it will be made anonymous- no one will know you. Then the third step is that it will be encrypted. Even if someone steals your data they won't be able to read it - there is a lock on it. After that, then people inside Ant Financial can start to analyse the data and use it.</p><p>In the big data age we understand you very well but we don't know you - you are like a familiar stranger.</p><p>Without this protection finance would never progress - the business would be unsustainable. We're just starting to take advantage of data to serve the customer well - it is crucial.</p><p>Right now we think it is big data but 30 years from now the amount of data could be 500,000 times bigger.</p><p>But in the meantime the challenge of privacy protection and data security has just started.</p><p>Q But aren't hackers becoming ever more sophisticated and cyber attacks increasingly frequent? A This is the war everyone faces in the digital age including traditional banks.</p><p>Ant faces many cyberattacks every day, which gives us a lot of experience. We've seen the most attacks and we've learnt a lot from them. This means attackers have not yet been able to outsmart us thus far, but you can never say never.</p><p>Q What is Ant doing in the field of insurance? A We probably have the largest number of insurance users in the world. More than 350 million people have used one of the insurance products on our platforms, such as shipping return insurance.</p><p>This is a classic example of how you can entirely design and change an insurance product through technology. If you buy this [shipping return] insurance you can return items bought online for free if you end up returning the products you bought.</p><p>We worked with an insurance company - which used its own actuarial techniques to set rates.</p><p>The insurance company lost tens of millions in half a year for this shipping return product, so our big data and AI department worked closely with them in order to better identify risk. As a result they could distinguish between who would return items more often. With our big data analysis they were able to slash premiums for most people. In the end everyone bought the product.</p><p>Shipping return insurance is a very cheap product but this is something we really care about - why do we care? Because according to studies without this insurance a customer would buy a bit less online.</p><p>The product actually stimulates consumption, creating a virtuous circle.</p><p>It is also good for the merchants because it reduces their costs. Before this insurance, whenever customers had a bad experience they would call the merchants and fight with them. So the merchants had to hire a big customer service force. With this insurance product, whenever the client is unhappy he gets paid and no need for long phone conversations with customer service.</p><p>This is a typical example of how financial innovation can solve a pain point in life.</p><p>Another example is account safety insurance.</p><p>You may have some money in Alipay but you might be worried about fraud and account theft so you buy insurance. It costs just one or two yuan to insure $1 million equivalent against fraud and identity theft.</p><p>We think insurance probably has the highest pain point among financial services.</p><p>Almost everyone doesn't know which insurance policy to buy or who to trust: it's like a black box. In other areas like payments, wealth management, or consumer loans you have seen some innovation, but in insurance, eh-eh, not so much.</p><p>We think it has to be broken - something has to change.</p><p>Big data will help better price risk, for the benefit of everyone.</p><p>In car insurance a huge chunk of the cost is to verify the size of the loss in the case of an accident.</p><p>Now, you only need to take a picture and our image recognition-driven car exterior assessment technology, which we provided to several insurance companies, will tell you that the accident will cost you this much and recommend whether you should report to your insurance company or not (which might raise your premiums for next year). [Called scratch and dent insurance in the US]. Also it tells you where the nearest garage is for help.</p><p>Big data will also help reconstruct the experience of dealing with an insurance company. Insurance companies are running up to us to work with us on this.</p><p>We have developed a credit scorecard for car insurance - like a FICO score - so we can help insurance companies distinguish good drivers and bad drivers.</p><p>Q Who owns the end customer when you partner with an insurance company? A It has to be beneficial to both sides and somehow it has to be sustainable.</p><p>We are better in using technology to reconstruct the users' experience and better at reaching the customers. Financial institutions have reputation, they have capital, they know how to design financial products. A lot of fund managers use Ant Fortune [an investing app]. They feel like this is their home; it's a platform linking them together and we give them a lot of technical support.</p><p>Q Yu'e Bao has grown so fast and it is so large that some people are worried about systematic risk? How does Ant Financial view this potential problem? A Yu'e Bao is a typical money market fund - it is pocket money for the online shoppers. Yu'e Bao is liquid, unleveraged, fully disclosed and transparent. Risk is quite low. Money market funds are a different animal - they can only invest in best short-term debt. Also unlike banks, money market funds don't have leverage.</p><p>Money market funds were first created in 1971 in the United States and they have never cost the taxpayers a penny. As far as I am aware, and I have studied this, there are only two funds that have lost any principal capital.</p><p>History tells us that thus far it is a reasonable regulatory arrangement.</p><p>The role of finance is not to kill risk, it is to balance the risk and benefits. Banks manage a mismatch in duration.</p><p>Q Are know-yourcustomer requirements loosening up? A KYC is important. Identification [verification] is the basis of finance. So we spend a lot of time on it. [If there is a more secure, efficient and user-friendly indentification verification system] then it benefits everyone including banks and us. The basis of finance is KYC. You can go as far as your KYC stretches. If you cannot get comfortable with a customer and his/her identity, don't serve them.</p><p>Q Does China's crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) suggest China is being less tolerant of financial innovation generally? A There must be some regulation of ICOs otherwise a lot of people's money will be lost. To a large extent China is right to tighten regulations.</p><p>It is very hard for regulators to balance the benefits and risk. In the US, after the financial crisis regulation became so tight that banks don't have much life any more.</p><p>China is indeed emphasising more security these days for the whole financial sector.</p><p>Regulations have cycles just like business has cycles.</p><p>The biggest bubble in Chinese fintech that we have already experienced was in P2P [peer-to-peer lending]. More than two thirds of P2Ps went under, and more will follow.</p><p>Back in 2014 Alipay made the decision not to provide payment services for P2P.</p><p>ICOs have taken only a few months to go through the same cycle that P2P went through across several years.</p><p>The combination of blockchain, bitcoin and the IPO creates a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>Yet the fintech trend is irreversible, and we believe that it will integrate into life, I call it FinLife. But in some areas it can afford to take a little break. FA</p><p>\"Finance  ;  ;  is so far  ;  ;  from being  ;  ;  inclusive  ;  ;  that we see  ;  ;  blue ocean  ;  ;  everywhere\"  ;  ;</p><p>\"The role of finance is not to  ;  ;  kill risk, it is to

Ant's $1.2 billion bid for Dallas-based money transfer service MoneyGram International is under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius) .</p><p>Ant Financial is \"on track to be the world's largest fintech company,\" Mubayi said.</p><p>Investors are understandably excited about Ant Financial's prospects and plans ahead of its public listing, tipped for next year. The IPO has the potential to be the largest fundraising ever by a fintech innovator. Ant Financial will still be 33% owned by Alibaba ifthe company is listed in the future, according to Alibaba's annual report.</p><p>Ant Financial is already estimated to be worth more than $70.5 billion, according to equity analysts at Goldman Sachs; bigger than the market capitalisation of Swiss bank UBS.</p><p>First developed as an online payment system for Alibaba's internet marketplace, its Alipay mobile payment platform has expanded into the physical world, enabling users to make payments instantly by scanning the QR codes in their smart phone.</p><p>It took a step further on September 1, deploying its facial recognition payment system \"Smile to Pay\" at a Yum China restaurant in its hometown ofHangzhou.</p><p>Chen also addressed fears that Ant's online money fund Yu'e Bao, meaning leftover treasure, has grown so large it poses a systemic risk.</p><p>The following transcript of the conversation has been edited for clarity.</p><p>Q Which areas of finance overseas offer the most promising opportunities for digital disruption and growth for Ant Financial?</p><p>A There is so much that can be done in payments, wealth management, consumer loans, SME [small- and medium-sized enterprise] loans and insurance.</p><p>Finance is so far from being inclusive that we see blue ocean everywhere.</p><p>In the US, payments are very out dated, even though it is the most advanced financial system in the world.</p><p>People should have their own balance sheet to manage their financial life. It will come and it will come fast.</p><p>Finance will be democratised, just like at Yu'e Bao. You have just one yuan? You can still grow it. At a traditional bank if you only have a little money, then who is going to talk to you?</p><p>Q What will you do with MoneyGram if Ant's acquisition is approved?</p><p>A I can't discuss that but what I can say is that international cross border payments cost up to 7% globally - more than twice as high as it needs to be.</p><p>Q What are your plans for growing \"Smile to Pay\"?</p><p>A There are different ways to complete payments. One of them is facial technology, but it's not clear if it will become the most widely used way to complete payments in the future.</p><p>The key yardstick is the users' experience.</p><p>We started with QR code payments [scannable codes that resemble square mazes], which became extremely popular.</p><p>When Apple Pay came out with its version of NFC [near field communications] payments there was quite some excitement, but it is far from being the major player.</p><p>Whatever payment method is most widely used will evolve the fastest and dominate payments.</p><p>Safety is not the major concern for payments - because transactions are already very safe, thanks to our AI-driven risk management system.</p><p>Our fraud loss rate is already lower than 1 in 1 million, meaning that for every one million dollars there is one dollar of loss.</p><p>That is better than bank debit or credit cards in China. Their official average loss rate is estimated to be about two basis points [0.02%]. Also bear in mind that China's bank loss rate is low compared with the rest of the world.</p><p>Q Don't people worry about privacy? Will this hamper Ant Financial's development?</p><p>A Privacy and data security are the building blocks of the digital age. People kind of assume in the big data age that their data will be detected and watched, but that is not the case.</p><p>Any data that is collected has to be authorised. Then before any one can use it the data has to go through desensitisation, which means it will be made anonymousno one will know you. Then the third step is that it will be encrypted. Even if someone steals your data they won't be able to read it - there is a lock on it. After that, then people inside Ant Financial can start to analyse the data and use it.</p><p>In the big data age we understand you very well but we don't know you - you are like a familiar stranger.</p><p>Without this protection finance would never progress - the business would be unsustainable. We're just starting to take advantage of data to serve the customer well - it is crucial.</p><p>Right now we think it is big data but 30 years from now the amount of data could be 500,000 times bigger.</p><p>But in the meantime the challenge of privacy protection and data security has just started.</p><p>Q But aren't hackers becoming ever more sophisticated and cyber attacks increasingly frequent?</p><p>A This is the war everyone faces in the digital age including traditional banks.</p><p>Ant faces many cyberattacks every day, which gives us a lot of experience. We've seen the most attacks and we've learnt a lot from them. This means attackers have not yet been able to outsmart us thus far, but you can never say never.</p><p>Q What is Ant doing in the field of insurance?</p><p>A We probably have the largest number of insurance users in the world. More than 350 million people have used one of the insurance products on our platforms, such as shipping return insurance.</p><p>This is a classic example of how you can entirely design and change an insurance product through technology. If you buy this [shipping return] insurance you can return items bought online for free if you end up returning the products you bought.</p><p>We worked with an insurance company - which used its own actuarial techniques to set rates.</p><p>The insurance company lost tens of millions in half a year for this shipping return product, so our big data and AI department worked closely with them in order to better identify risk. As a result they could distinguish between who would return items more often. With our big data analysis they were able to slash premiums for most people. In the end everyone bought the product.</p><p>Shipping return insurance is a very cheap product but this is something we really care about - why do we care? Because according to studies without this insurance a customer would buy a bit less online.</p><p>The product actually stimulates consumption, creating a virtuous circle.</p><p>It is also good for the merchants because it reduces their costs. Before this insurance, whenever customers had a bad experience they would call the merchants and fight with them. So the merchants had to hire a big customer service force. With this insurance product, whenever the client is unhappy he gets paid and no need for long phone conversations with customer service.</p><p>This is a typical example of how financial innovation can solve a pain point in life.</p><p>Another example is account safety insurance.</p><p>You may have some money in Alipay but you might be worried about fraud and account theft so you buy insurance. It costs just one or two yuan to insure $1 million equivalent against fraud and identity theft.</p><p>We think insurance probably has the highest pain point among financial services.</p><p>Almost everyone doesn't know which insurance policy to buy or who to trust: it's like a black box. In other areas like payments, wealth management, or consumer loans you have seen some innovation, but in insurance, eh-eh, not so much.</p><p>We think it has to be broken - something has to change. Big data will help better price risk, for the benefit of everyone.</p><p>In car insurance a huge chunk ofthe cost is to verify the size of the loss in the case of an accident.</p><p>Now, you only need to take a picture and our image recognition-driven car exterior assessment technology, which we provided to several insurance companies, will tell you that the accident will cost you this much and recommend whether you should report to your insurance company or not (which might raise your premiums for next year). [Called scratch and dent insurance in the US]. Also it tells you where the nearest garage is for help.</p><p>Big data will also help reconstruct the experience of dealing with an insurance company. Insurance companies are running up to us to work with us on this.</p><p>We have developed a credit scorecard for car insurance - like a FICO score - so we can help insurance companies distinguish good drivers and bad drivers.</p><p>Q Who owns the end customer when you partner with an insurance company?</p><p>A It has to be beneficial to both sides and somehow it has to be sustainable.</p><p>We are better in using technology to reconstruct the users' experience and better at reaching the customers. Financial institutions have reputation, they have capital, they know how to design financial products. A lot of fund managers use Ant Fortune [an investing app]. They feel like this is their home; it's a platform linking them together and we give them a lot of technical support.</p><p>Q Yu'e Bao has grown so fast and it is so large that some people are worried about systematic risk? How does Ant Financial view this potential problem?</p><p>A Yu'e Bao is a typical money market fund - it is pocket money for the online shoppers. Yu'e Bao is liquid, unleveraged, fully disclosed and transparent. Risk is quite low.</p><p>Money market funds are a different animal - they can only invest in best short-term debt. Also unlike banks, money market funds don't have leverage.</p><p>Money market funds were first created in 1971 in the United States and they have never cost the taxpayers a penny. As far as I am aware, and I have studied this, there are only two funds that have lost any principal capital.</p><p>History tells us that thus far it is a reasonable regulatory arrangement.</p><p>The role of finance is not to kill risk, it is to balance the risk and benefits. Banks manage a mismatch in duration.</p><p>Q Are know-yourcustomer requirements loosening up?</p><p>A KYC is important. Identification [verification] is the basis of finance. So we spend a lot of time on it. [If there is a more secure, efficient and user-friendly indentification verification system] then it benefits everyone including banks and us. The basis of finance is KYC. You can go as far as your KYC stretches. If you cannot get comfortable with a customer and his/her identity, don't serve them.</p><p>Q Does China's crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) suggest China is being less tolerant of financial innovation generally?</p><p>A There must be some regulation of ICOs otherwise a lot of people's money will be lost. To a large extent China is right to tighten regulations.</p><p>It is very hard for regulators to balance the benefits and risk. In the US, after the financial crisis regulation became so tight that banks don't have much life any more.</p><p>China is indeed emphasising more security these days for the whole financial sector.</p><p>Regulations have cycles just like business has cycles.</p><p>The biggest bubble in Chinese fintech that we have already experienced was in P2P [peer-to-peer lending]. More than two thirds of P2Ps went under, and more will follow.</p><p>Back in 2014 Alipay made the decision not to provide payment services for P2P.</p><p>ICOs have taken only a few months to go through the same cycle that P2P went through across several years.</p><p>The combination of blockchain, bitcoin and the IPO creates a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>Yet the fintech trend is irreversible, and we believe that it will integrate into life, I call it FinLife. But in some areas it can afford to take a little break.

Profitability increased thanks to cost drives, while balance sheets strengthened through derisking assets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banks' ability to grow revenue, however, remains a perennial challenge. The quest to growth may be harder in the digital age. In a recent report by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the global regulator warned that while fintechs still operate at the fringe of banking, the big tech firms - such as Amazon and Google - are starting to pose an existential threat to incumbent banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scale and scope advantages of traditional banks can often be outshone by the tech giants' capacity to invest and prowl to acquire. Proprietary customer insights enjoyed by banks are being sidestepped by ubiquitous data collection and superior analytical ability. Meanwhile, regulatory drives, such as PSD2 and Opening Banking, are giving the tech sector a helping hand in entering financial services.</p><p>Already, the tech titans have made a stride in payments, asset management, and insurance. The more formidable players, such as Amazon, are also beginning to offer core banking products like business loans and current accounts.</p><p>If the origination and distribution of financial products shifts from big banks to tech firms, so too could nearly two thirds of current banking profits. The FSB is not alarmist in its warning that banks may take on greater risks to recapture lost ground.</p><p>The financial industry must therefore focus on its \"disruption-proof\" core: customer experience, institutional trust, and regulatory excellence. Customer stickiness with incumbent players remains high: the dawn of Open Banking has yet to sway masses into changing their banking provider. Banks have a short window of opportunity to truly upgrade customer experience for the digital age. Banks' global digital investment is expected to grow four per cent per year to reach $300bn by 2021. But how they spend that investment must evolve.</p><p>Much of the digital investment to date has focussed on migrating and consolidating existing IT systems to address legacy issues. The nature of consumer-facing banking services has not meaningfully evolved.</p><p>The next phase of digital investment will need to focus on driving genuine innovation that reshapes the customer experience - else banks risk losing this business for a slicker operation.</p><p>Preserving institutional trust in the age of digital finance will also be key.</p><p>Banks are still recovering a decade on from the financial crisis, but the tech giants are starting to feel the pinch from changing public opinion. The trend of celebrating all things Silicon Valley has given way to a growing array of concerns, from data privacy to competition to \"fake news\".</p><p>Avoiding damage is fundamental to preserving trust. But as UK financial firms saw a five-fold increase in the number of cyber breaches in 2018, this is by no means a given.</p><p>Financial institutions face an increasingly complex threat landscape and risks associated with their own digital innovations. This calls for operational resilience to be viewed as no less important than financial resilience. Regulatory excellence in digital finance is the last piece of the jigsaw. Financial regulators are playing catch-up in evolving supervisory and conduct rules to accommodate new technology providers. Level playing field concerns are natural when the new entrants are startup fintechs, but the pendulum may need to shift to focusing on regulatory parity if the tech giants make a meaningful play for banking market share.</p><p>Banks still have the track record of enabling consumers, businesses and economies to growth on their side - but only for the time being.</p><p>To move on from turnaround to transformation, banks must now use digital investment to enable customers to bank in a way that tech firms will no doubt be itching to do themselves \u00a3 Kuangyi Wei is director of strategy and external affairs at Parker Fitzgerald.</p><p>Amazon and Google are starting to pose an existential threat to incumbent banks</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-147077873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VK2-VGM1-DYTY-C32K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

It also warned of new dangers, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/12/kristalina-georgieva-imf-washington-climate-crisis\">higher levels of corporate debt</url>, weaker lending standards, and cyber-attacks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an open letter to G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, FSB chairman Randal Quarles suggested that a long period of growth and rising asset prices had lulled institutions and firms into a false sense of security.</p><p>\"The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/12/kristalina-georgieva-imf-washington-climate-crisis\">outlook for global growth</url> has started to weaken and become more uncertain. Declining long-term interest rates have supported risky asset prices. Corporate and public debt levels continue to rise. And financial markets now expect very low, or even negative, interest rates to persist for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\"These increasing risks meet a financial system that is much more resilient than it was before the financial crisis. However, the long period of sustained global growth and rising asset prices may have weakened the incentives to take precautions against unforeseen events,\" he said.</p><p>The FSB boss said Brexit was also among the risks that leaders must be prepared to tackle.</p><p>\"We need to be ready to address evolving risks to global financial stability, be they related to current downside risks to growth and uncertainties around Brexit, or structural changes in the financial system, such as the growing role of non-bank financial intermediation,\" Quarles said.</p><p> The latest poll of UK finance chiefs showed that persistent uncertainty about how Brexit will unfold is increasingly knocking business confidence and making firms less prepared to invest.</p><p>Almost 60% of finance bosses surveyed by the accountancy firm Deloitte said cost cutting was a strong priority - the highest proportion in a decade.</p><p>Overall, 76% believe the UK business environment will be worse off as a result of Brexit. </p><p>The FSB's letter is aimed at leaders gathered in Washington DC this week, where the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are holding their annual meetings. The finance ministers and central bank bosses of the G20 will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/12/kristalina-georgieva-imf-washington-climate-crisis\">hold their own meeting</url> in the US capital on 17-18 October.</p><p>The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who formerly chaired the FSB, is expected to attend alongside the Bank of Japan boss, Haruhiko Kuroda, the World Bank president, David Malpass, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, David Solomon, as well as the new IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.</p><p>Carney and fellow governors have been told to keep a close eye on the impact of low interest rates, which have left investors searching for returns from riskier assets. The FSB said it is now developing a surveillance framework that will help assess those emerging dangers.</p><p>The letter also raised questions about potential risks linked to technological advances in the industry, includingthird parties and big tech firms entering the sector by providing essential services like cloud storage. Amazon has become a major player in banking, with its web services division picking up customers across the financial services industry.</p><p>The FSB plans to present its fifth annual report, which tracks reforms launched in the wake of the banking crisis, at the G20 finance ministers meeting later this week.</p><p>It is expected to highlight some progress: banks holding more capital as a cushion against losses, derivatives markets becoming more transparent, and asset-backed securities becoming less complex.</p><p>\"Yet our mission is far from complete,\" said Quarles. \"This is certainly the case with respect to the agreed G20 reforms, where the implementation progress remains uneven across key reform areas, and where we are in the process of evaluating that reforms are working as intended.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-56934782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X89-1D91-JCJY-G20J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

On June 3/4 that year, the world watched, horrified, as the communist government crushed demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Perhaps as many as 10,000 people, who had come out to protest about corruption and the slow pace of reform, were killed.Yet within a few years China had started to get the attention of international investors as it tinkered with new ideas and piloted schemes to see what would or would not work. Deng Xiaoping, the leader who first set China on the path to reform, inspiring his compatriots with the slogan \"to get rich is glorious\", visited Shenzhen in 1992 to unveil the first of its experimental special economic zones. The southern city, bordering Hong Kong, was then little more than a cluster of houses set in rice fields, yet within a few years it was one of China's most important manufacturing centres.But plenty more was going on behind the scenes. Kenneth Koo remembers visiting Beijing in September 1992 as part of a delegation from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and meeting Zhu Rongji in the Great Hall of the People.\"[He] stunned us by saying he was hopeful of getting the first mainland corporate listed in Hong Kong by the following summer, in a mere nine months,\" says Koo. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ken Koo, Citi</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Orient Securities</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Koo, who is now deputy general manager of Citi Orient Securities, based in Shanghai, refused to believe the timeline was possible.\"You have to remember that back then, there was no company law in China, no statutory rules for shareholders, no real accounting system, that's how raw it was.\" Zhu, who had attracted attention as a reformer when he was mayor of Shanghai, was the State Council's rising economic tsar and later became premier; and he proved as good as his word. In July 1993, Tsingtao Brewery sold shares to the public in Hong Kong, marking the first H-share listing.Sector by sector, China took its big state firms public. First came energy and telecoms, then insurance and airlines, and finally its big commercial banks.None of them were, in the purest sense of the term, privatizations: Beijing retains control of each corporate body. But, says Koo, the sales, \"did a lot of good for China. Most of those companies improved as they were exposed to the glare of public marketing and to annual and semi-annual reporting. It imposed some form of governance.\" China admires the US economy and financial system and know that it is important to have both a properly functioning bond market and a robust stock market \u00a0-\u00a0Ken Koo, Citi Orient Securities Economically and politically, China enmeshed itself in the global community it had once eschewed, joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 and relaxing the renminbi's strict peg to the dollar four years later. When the global financial crisis hit, it unveiled a huge stimulus package that kept its economy afloat.The process of engagement has accelerated. In 2013, president Xi Jinping unveiled the Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious plan to redraw the global trade map in China's image.Two years later, he launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a new multilateral, with the intention of taking on agencies such as the World Bank, controlled by western powers. A five-year-old \"~stock connect' programme that links Shanghai and Hong Kong, and allows investors to trade shares on the other market using local brokers, was a hit, persuading Beijing to introduce a similar scheme for bonds in 2017.China's currency is now an integral part of the basket of currencies that make up the IMF's special drawing rights (SDRs), while mainland securities are rapidly becoming mainstays of global indices. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Benjamin Lamberg,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Benjamin Lamberg, global head of medium-term notes and private placements and head of Asia credit at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, calls the decision to include Chinese bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, on April 1 2019, the country's \"Big-Bang moment\".So much for what has been done over the last 30 years. What comes next? Making concrete predictions about any country is problematic. Fortunes wax and wane, demographics shift, and financial crises knock budgets off kilter.The challenge of forecasting is magnified in a country like China, which has spent three decades defying all the odds. That the People's Republic has become the workshop of the world without opening its capital account is remarkable, as is the fact that so little is still known about the guts of Asia's largest economy.Even the prime minister distrusts GDP figures issued by the national data bureau.But drawing on our own experience, and after speaking to debt bankers and currency analysts, green finance gurus and investment bankers, all working in the country, Asiamoney feels confident enough to set out 10 bold predictions about where China will change, for better and for worse, in the three decades to come. 1. By 2050, China's bond market will be the largest and most interesting, liquid and heavily traded on the planetChina's bond market is the third largest in the world, with $12.3 trillion outstanding at the end of 2018, according to Swift, behind Japan ($13 trillion) and the US ($40.3 trillion). Despite a byzantine legal framework and a lack of liquidity \"\" matters that regulators must address \"\" foreign investment in onshore bonds has tripled to $300 billion since December 2016.Inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index will channel another $150 billion into the asset class by 2021, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole predicts that the market will quadruple in size by 2025 to between $47 trillion and $55 trillion, putting it on a par with the US. The process will be driven partly by necessity: China is desperate for fresh sources of capital to continue to fuel its economy, and is keen to disintermediate its banks. Renminbi debt is about to make the jump from niche product to mainstream asset class. Wherever you are, be it Sydney or Singapore, you will have to buy Chinese bonds\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Benjamin Lamberg, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \"They admire the US economy and financial system and know that it is important to have both a properly functioning bond market and a robust stock market,\" says Koo, of Citi Orient Securities.The process will be expedited by the rise of the renminbi.Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Lamberg expects renminbi-denominated debt to make up between 5% and 7% of the international debt market in five years, against less than 2% at present.\"Renminbi debt is about to make the jump from niche product to mainstream asset class,\" he says. \"Wherever you are, be it Sydney or Singapore, you will have to buy Chinese bonds.\" 2. China will become a leader in green finance and green bonds, cleaning up its act and becoming a soft power along the way. It has no other choiceChina is paying the price for its searing pace of development. Asiamoney asks Ma Jun, the former chief economist at the People's Bank of China who is now a clarion voice on green finance, if Beijing can take the lead in sustainable investing.\"We already are in many areas,\" he replies, pointing to electric car production, renewable energy output and a push to make 50% of all new housing carbon neutral by 2021. \"We can force banks not to lend to bad polluters, and do it more effectively than any other country.\"China accounts for 70% of all green bonds sold in the emerging world; mainland issuers, led by financial institutions, printed $31 billion worth of green bonds in 2018, or 18% of the total, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, ranking behind only the US.The PBoC is forging global partnerships while innovating furiously at home: take the pilot scheme in Huzhou that matches green projects with green bank loans. Critics might point to the veracity of onshore data and question the inclusion of clean coal in many so-called green projects, but the truth is China has to become the world leader in green finance. The degradation of its air and water, not to mention its soil, which Ma reckons will cost Rmb70 trillion ($7.23 trillion) to clean up, leaves it no other option. 3. China will not be the world's largest economy by 2050 Every agency that sets out to gauge the size of China's economy by 2050 reaches the same conclusion. All say it will be the world's largest, way ahead of the US. And all of them are wrong. China's economic growth has been slowing for years: most global bodies, the IMF included, see growth coming in at between 6% and 6.5% in 2019 and 2020, despite a trade war with the US. But those forecasts are based on fickle state data, and many say the real rate of growth is just half that.Morningstar forecasts GDP to be between 3.25% and 3.5% in 2019, while Mike Pettis, professor of finance at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, says it is \"not much more than 3%\".It was China's great fortune to open up just as globalization kicked in and a surge of young adults entered the workplace. These days, China is an expensive place to operate in, and old: the average mainlander will be 56 years old by the middle of this century, versus 44 in America.Total debt is nearing three times GDP, while the cost of combating climate change will surge as the country's north dries out and the south floods.\"People will look back in 30 years and see that today was peak China,\" says Fraser Howie, co-author of \"~Privatizing China'. \"Indonesia, India and Africa will accelerate, and China won't be much more of the global economy by mid-century than it is now. A long, Japan-style recession is a very likely and maybe a good scenario for China. If they manage the next transition without massive and violent upheaval, they'll have done well.\" 4. The renminbi will be Asia's reserve currency, but will still defer to the dollar In conjunction with the central bank, Beijing has managed expectations of its currency well. The renminbi was added to the IMF's SDR basket in October 2016 and now represents a shade under 11% of the basket, against 41.73% for the dollar and 30.93% for the euro. The renminbi could be among the top five most liquid and tradable currencies within three to five years \u00a0-\u00a0Paul Mackel, HSBC Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Lamberg predicts the renminbi's weighting will increase to around 14% or 15% when the IMF next evaluates its basket in 2020. But anyone expecting the renminbi to supplant the dollar as the world's reserve currency will be disappointed. That Beijing covets a more international renminbi is no secret.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Paul Mackel,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">HSBC</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"The US can print as many dollars as it wants,\" says Lamberg. \"China wants to wield that kind of power: to be able to issue its own currency when and how it wants, and to not be dependent on the greenback.\"But it will not rush the process, opting to \"continue moving toward a \"~clean floating' FX regime\", says Paul Mackel, head of emerging markets currency research at HSBC, as more global capital flows into mainland stocks and bonds.\"The renminbi could be among the top five most liquid and tradable currencies within three to five years,\" he adds. (It is currently eighth). Where its impact will be felt is in the belt-and-road countries, notably in Africa and central Asia, where it will, Lamberg says, \"within 10 years\"\u00a6 overtake the US dollar\", and across Asia, where it is, Mackel believes, already the most influential currency. 5. Shanghai will not be a global financial hub, but it will overtake Hong KongHong Kong's stock exchange had a banner year in 2018. A record 208 firms listed on the bourse, raising $36.6 billion, according to Deloitte, more than for any other city. Mainland firms still favour a listing in the former British colony: recent additions to the HKSE include phone maker Xiaomi and delivery platform Meituan Dianping. Yet Hong Kong faces an uncertain future. Many of its best traits, like freedom of speech and rule of law, are being eroded. It is also a prohibitively expensive place to live.The balance of power will slowly shift north to Shanghai, for two reasons.First, Shanghai is home to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the world's fourth-largest bourse by market capitalization (Hong Kong currently lies sixth) and is pushing hard to secure more listings by technology firms.On June 6, three firms were approved to list on the new Science and Technology Innovation Board, a Nasdaq-style venue that speeds up the IPO process, and waives restrictions on how firms are priced. Citi Orient's Koo says the new board will be a \"game-changer\".And second, because a confluence of events, from a more global renminbi to the inclusion of Chinese stocks and bonds in global indices, will force financial groups to open offices in Shanghai, following in the footsteps of firms like Aberdeen Standard Investments.\"To get a full picture of the market, you need people onshore: credit analysts, portfolio managers, local experts with the right understanding of context and culture,\" says Lamberg of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\"Everyone will need to have an onshore China strategy,\" says Ning Tang, chairman and chief executive of financial services group CreditEase.But in terms of global relevance, Shanghai is unlikely to vie with the likes of London or New York: the lack of a free-floating currency will see to that.Howie says: \"You need free flow of people, money and information to be a global centre. I don't see China having any of them.\" 6. China's capital account will not be fully openIn May 2019, when he became governor of the People's Bank of China, Yi Gang said capital account convertibility must be achieved \"gradually, steadily\", citing the chaos that engulfed Thailand during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. Nothing unsettles Beijing more than disorder and mayhem, so the carrot suspended in front of investors for 30 years will continue to dangle.\"I do not expect China to fully open up its capital account in the next 15 years,\" says Lamberg of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.Jonathan Slone, former chief executive of CLSA, a Hong Kong brokerage owned by Citic Securities, says the country will \"continue to liberalize, to move forward in a thoughtful way. But anyone who believes it will open its capital account [fully over the next 30 years] doesn't understand how the country works.\" 7. China's banks will face a crisis of identityThe appointment of former China Construction Bank (CCB) chief Guo Shuqing as banking regulator in 2017 was a shock to the system. He clamped down on lending, forced banks to resolve bad loans, and fined those who hid their non-performing loans. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cliff Sheng,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Oliver Wyman</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>\"Guo was giving the banking sector the Heimlich manoeuvre,\" says Jason Bedford, a financial analyst at UBS in Hong Kong. A year later, the political heavyweight was promoted to run the newly formed banking and insurance regulator.</p><p>For China's big state lenders, the meaty challenges lie ahead: deciding who they are and what they want to be. At home, they are threatened by the likes of Alibaba and Tencent, tech titans that have expanded rapidly and seamlessly into payments, wealth management products and banking.</p><p>These firms pose a \"subtle and significant threat\" to traditional banks, says Cliff Sheng, a Beijing-based partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman who advises several large fintechs. \"Consumers spend no time with lenders, but are on Tencent's apps seven hours a day.

Expect more competition and collaboration.</p><p>And what of their global ambitions? The likes of ICBC, Bank of China and CCB have expanded selectively, opening branches in big cities and snagging assets here and there, but avoiding buying sprees. Beyond that?</p><p> Consumers spend no time with lenders, but are on Tencent's apps seven hours a day. Traditional banks are losing the consumer's time and attention, but worse, they are losing out on the data they need \u00a0-\u00a0Cliff Sheng, Oliver Wyman </p><p>UBS's Bedford says China will \"work assiduously to continue to clean up the banking system, but it will gradually wane in relative importance as the capital markets grow in scale and strength and become much more internationally accessible\".</p><p>But will any of the big banks have the guts and gumption to go global?</p><p>Howie thinks not: \"Wherever Chinese corporates go, China's banks will be. They'll do what Japan's banks have always done with their firms. No more, no less.\" 8. Fintechs will encounter a double backlash The salad days are over for China's leading financial technology firms. Yes, they continue to roll out new services at home, while scouring the world for assets to buy and markets to disrupt, but gone is the light-touch regulation that enabled them to grow big, fast.</p><p>The regulator has cracked down on peer-to-peer lenders: in February 2019, it closed 380 online lenders and froze $1.5 billion in assets. China's big private firms are savvy survival experts adept at reading the political runes, and fintechs are no exception.</p><p>\"They started life in a loosely regulated market, but regulators now want to constrain them,\" says Sheng of Oliver Wyman. \"Fintechs will have to decide whether to be financial institutions or technology enablers.\"</p><p>It is worth noting that Ant Financial is repositioning itself as more of a technology firm, while Tencent is keen to specialize in building and marketing technology that supports smaller lenders, particularly in emerging markets, sources say.</p><p>As the backlash against big tech ramps up in the west, China's fintechs, observing events from afar, may withdraw to focus on the one market they know best, one industry analyst predicts. 9. Wealth management is set to explode</p><p>Along with bonds and the renminbi, this is the big one. There are approximately 1.9 million high net-worth individuals in China, classified by Wealth-X as anyone with a net worth of between $1 million and $30 million.</p><p>Many are first-generation tycoons who came of age as China started to open up, says CreditEase chairman Ning, whose firm is a leading provider of wealth management products. He reckons Rmb200 trillion ($29 trillion) will pass into the hands of a second generation of family members in the 2020s, and how the industry handles that challenge will affect China for decades to come.</p><p>\"It's a profound moment,\" he tells Asiamoney. \"It's the first time so much wealth has changed hands. If it works, there is a strong possibility that in 30 years' time, China will have the world's biggest wealth management industry.\"</p><p>But if the process is botched \"\" if advice is poor or goes unheeded, or if fortunes are frittered away or channelled blindly into speculative and risky investments that \"cause the financial markets to become very turbulent, a huge amount of wealth will be destroyed\", he adds.</p><p>The challenge is immense. While some super-wealthy Chinese live global lives, their fortunes overseen by bankers in Singapore and Zurich, London and New York, many others \"have no idea what portfolio management is\", says Ning, and are often swayed by wild promises of huge returns. \"You have to do a lot of basic financial literacy. China's market is very big, but there isn't much low-hanging fruit. With a lot of people, you have to start with the basics.\"</p><p>Expect to see a clutch of world-class Chinese asset and wealth managers emerge over the next 30 years, based in Shanghai and with offices around the world, while an elite group of private banks, among them Credit Suisse and UBS, profit handsomely onshore. 10. After a strong start, the belt and road initiative will fade from view President Xi Jinping's project of the century, launched in 2013 with the aim of rewriting the global trade map, won't be a bust. It has led to hundreds of billions of dollars of projects being built in Asia, Africa and Europe, from airports and highways to dams and ports. But too many are frivolous or expensive, mire the host country in debt, and are accused of being poorly built and environmentally damaging boondoggles.</p><p>Ma, the central bank's green guru, fears that unless BRI projects are designed more efficiently, \"it will lead to the emission of many times the current carbon levels in future decades\".</p><p>The latest BRI forum, held in Beijing in April, was poorly attended, and the project is increasingly unpopular both abroad and at home. When Asiamoney met with a group of elite business students in Beijing, mention of the plan was met with derision.</p><p>\"I foresee rhetoric around the BRI slowly being scaled down,\" says Privatizing China author Howie.</p><p>\"It won't be a bust, and the infrastructure that is being built will remain, but its global and political ambitions will be wound down, and it will come to be seen as a costly enterprise that generated little in return, and has just annoyed too many people around the world.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1fzrv0xm5cnf1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK1-5CR1-F0GS-H4VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Digitalization is at the forefront of the challenges facing the banking industry as it undergoes a period of unprecedented upheaval.Profit margins and returns are being squeezed as traditional banks face a perfect storm of negative interest rates, tight regulatory scrutiny and increased competition from new entrants, which range from small fintech upstarts to the giants of Big Tech. Regulatory authorities are increasingly interested in the new products and business models being adopted by market participants. These new market participants have captured the zeitgeist by catering to tech-savvy consumers who demand seamless online banking, instant information and high-quality services at lower costs. </p><p>And regulatory authorities are increasingly interested in the new products and business models being adopted by these market participants.The user experience is being tailored for mobile devices, and product features are adapting to the fast-changing consumer behaviors. Increased competition also comes from BigTech companies with large customer bases and major capabilities in the digital world: Google, Apple and Amazon are all scaling up their financial service capabilities and expanding into markets previously reserved for traditional banks. These companies continue to utilize the network effect to create platforms with plenty of users and the data that comes along with the users. More and more customers are offered various interactions in a single application as shown by the success of so-called \"super -apps,\" such as WeChat offered by Tencent in China.Payments are becoming increasingly integrated into other services and are less and less visible. The significance of cash is diminishing as well. Bricks-and-mortar branches are being replaced by chatbots programmed by natural language processing based on artificial intelligence (AI).Market participants and regulators are discussing both the benefits digitalization brings and the challenges it poses. So far, where Big Tech has entered the market, it has sought to collaborate with global financial services firms. This approach has the advantage that tech firms can work with regulated entities. Google and Citigroup have recently announced a partnership for a personal checking account service, while when Apple had launched its credit card, it did so with the help of Goldman Sachs, which is the issuer.But with the increasing influx of new technology players in banking, regulators are looking to prevent any loopholes in the supervisory scope and address new risks arising from such collaborations, through adequate prudential measures.Fintech and the scope of regulation and supervisionCollaboration between banks and fintech companies brings clear benefits, such as catering to customer demand for quick solutions, as well as the facilitation of cross-border banking services. But as a result, new systemically important institutions may emerge from these developments that will inevitably use Big Data and artificial intelligence extensively while closely working with the banking sector. US$111.8 bnGlobal investment in fintech companies in 2018 Source: KPMG, \"The Pulse of Fintech 2018\" As collaboration with traditional banks becomes more common, it raises the question of whether fintech companies should require a license to engage in banking business, whether directly or indirectly. Forcing fintech players that are partnering with banks within the purview of banking regulation and supervision to acquires a license would be premature as they do not extend financial services per se, but are only competing for small links of the value chain. However, it may be prudent to put a monitoring mechanism in place in order to facilitate quick supervisory adjustments in case of noticeable changes.With the proliferation of payment services from the likes of Apple and Google, data misuse becomes a big area of concern, as tech companies will have access to the personal data of billions of users that can be sold or used for marketing purposes. This goes hand-in-hand with the risk of a non-transparent credit scoring, which is leading to a so-called \"black-box effect.\" Credit scoring models that are based on artificial intelligence (AI) may use that data without the knowledge of the customer.As banks look to control costs and grapple with ever-more complex IT solutions, outsourcing is on the rise. But this outsourcing trend raises concerns over risk and market concentration.Towards a systemic crisis?If outsourcing leads to a situation where activities such as cloud computing end up being offered by just a handful of players, there could be severe operational risk implications for the whole banking sector. \"If any of these players were to get into trouble, a huge number of banks might be affected, possibly unleashing a systemic crisis,\" said Andrea Enria, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB in a speech in March 2019. The new level of interconnectedness within the banking value chain creates a complex network where any breach may have an impact on the entire value chain and could spark a systemic crisis Cybercrime is another obvious risk, particularly given the new level of interconnectedness achieved by the \"sliced and diced\" banking value chain supported by various players including banks and fintech companies. This creates a complex network where any breach may have an impact on the entire value chain and could spark a systemic crisis.The more business models become digital, the more important IT will be and the more complex technology will become as a result. Components of such complexity, such as AI, are prone to failures that are not easy to detect if small, or to more nuanced cyberattacks planned by entities that thoroughly understand the financial system. The risks embedded in these complexities are not restricted to technical disturbance of operational processes. It may manifest into substantive aspects of supervision, for example, the black-box effect mentioned earlier. Such challenges are tougher to deal with given the accelerating pace of digitalization, thereby requiring adaptations and market assessments that are more frequent. 3,583Number of fintech startups in EMEA as of February 2019Source: Statista Regulators and supervisors are actively and openly engaging in the deliberations around digitalization. \"We are neutral on technology. But one thing we are not neutral on is risk,\" said Enria.Supervisors recognize the challenge in dealing with innovation but ultimately wish to adhere to the core principal of \"same risk, same rules, same supervision.\" This means that banks should be supervised proportionate to their individual risk regardless of whether they use innovative or traditional methods.Different authorities have offered varied approaches to keep pace with technological advancements in the banking and finance industry. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in its early initiatives came up with the FCA \"sandbox,\" which provided a space for fintech startups and even larger established financial services firms to prove that their business models work and are compatible with the regulatory framework. This has enjoyed considerable success with some fintech players who have benefited from the FCA's approach calling for a global sandbox network.Meanwhile, the European Banking Authority has emphasized the increasing importance of new fintech providers in its new guidelines for outsourcing arrangements. While discussing the use of fintech solutions by traditional banks to achieve operational and cost efficiency, the EBA noted that \"outsourcing is a way to get relatively easy access to new technologies and to achieve economies of scale.\"Supervisors have stressed the need to ensure a high level of prudential safety as banks navigate various phases of technological change. Therefore, regulators and supervisors need to stay ahead of any new, emerging risks. A challenging aspect of dealing with the risks imposed by digitalization for banks is to ensure that they build up expertise and knowledge while establishing adequate governance structures and proper risk management practices. This also mandates simple measures such as regular training of employees and raising awareness of the problems with eliminating or attempting to diminish evident risks.Harnessing technology for supervisionSupervisors have not just reflected on the challenges of digitalization and possible ways of dealing with it, but have embraced ways of using technology and innovation to support supervision and increase efficiency.Supervisory technology\u2014 suptech\u2014the use of innovative technology by supervisory agencies to support supervision, are evolving in areas such as data collection and data analytics. With the increasing influx of new technology players, regulators are looking to prevent any loopholes in the supervisory scope and address new risks arising from such collaborations, through adequate prudential measures As new digital business models lead to an ever-increasing amount of high-frequency data, AI and machine learning can help to manage and mine this data. Supervisors can use machine learning to identify patterns that may help to predict systemic risks, analyze credit risk taken by banks, and even play a role in detecting money laundering. Repetitive and periodic tasks can be digitized and therefore free up the workforce to engage in new supervisory challenges.Digitalization can also make the supervisory process more efficient and less bureaucratic. However, supervisors emphasize that they should approach AI with caution due to potential risks and the need to make comprehensible decisions even when using suptech.Another area where technology might alter supervision is the way data is shared between banks and supervisors. One option to address the uprising challenges of digitalization for regulatory authorities could be to establish \"direct reporting\" processes. Direct reporting models can increase efficiency and ease the burden of data collecting. Big Data and AI may thus help to overcome information asymmetries. Suptech represents a refreshing development in the approach to supervising digitalization in the financial sector. What's next? While supervisory agencies gear up for newer challenges offered by digitalization, market participants must also get ready for an oversight regime that strives to strike a balance between evolving consumer choices, technological innovation and the scope of banking regulation and supervision.Click here to download 'Digitalization: Regulating the future of finance' PDF[1]Reetu Vishwakarma (Foreign Lawyer, Frankfurt) assisted in the development of this publication.[View source[2].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitecase.com/sites/default/files/2019-12/fro-december-2019-digitalization-regulating-future-finance-final.pdf\">https://www.whitecase.com/sites/default/files/2019-12/fro-december-2019-digitalization-regulating-future-finance-final.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/financial-regulatory-observer-december-2019/digitalization-regulating-future-finance\">https://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/financial-regulatory-observer-december-2019/digitalization-regulating-future-finance</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411157695905328175776100116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XT4-4B81-JCMN-Y0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1859\"/><timeReceived>8:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

The idea is simple, a website where the world can communicate. Do you have a stock related question, then why not ask 50,000 individual members? Are you a shareholder of Apple Inc(NASDAQ:AAPL)? Join the many members engaged in this stock right now. Come see for yourself at www.investorim.com for your complimentary subscription.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Foundry is among the most recent companies to conclude internal probes that were launched last year as part of a huge crackdown on the practice of changing the dates on grants to pump up the value of the stock option. From a press release dated Friday June 15, 2007.</p><p>Dozens of companies were pulled under an accounting spotlight that has helped reveal rampant backdating practices, but to date there have been few glaring legal ramifications. For the most part, the whole backdating issue remains a minor annoyance for investors.</p><p>In one of the higher profile cases, Apple and its <person><nameText>CEO Steve Jobs </nameText></person>were cleared in April by the SEC of any backdating charges after the company concluded its own investigation. Apple's former finance chief Fred Anderson, however, agreed to pay back more than $3 million relating to a backdated option. He also paid a small fine to settle the SEC case without admitting any wrongdoing.</p><p>Some backdating cases took a different turn, as at Comverse where top executives have been charged with fraud related to option grants. Former Comverse CEO Kobi Alexander, ex-finance chief David Kreinberg and onetime senior general counsel William Sorin were charged in August with defrauding shareholders by backdating options.</p><p>Kreinberg and Sorin pleaded guilty charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. Kreinberg agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Alexander fled to Namibia and was arrested there in September. He faces an extradition hearing later this month.</p><p>Foundry joins other big tech shops like Juniper and Broadcom that have now accounted for their backdating expenses. And if Apple's case is any indication, regulators may be willing to repeat the company's all clear sign.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>All material listed within InvestorIM (\"Profiles\") was based upon information supplied by the company or from other sources believed to be reliable.

The \u201cHarnessing the power of disruption\u201d report, released today, identifies key financial services areas open to - and already being impacted by -  advances in technology, changes in demographics and customer behaviour. In key areas including insurance, lending, savings and investments, and transactions, the analysis charts the \u201cdisruption\u201d occurring and quantifies the positive impact on consumers, businesses and the financial services industry serving them.  Of the total \u00a3106bn of estimated new business by 2030, PwC estimates more than half (\u00a353.6bn) will be driven by insurance (\u00a349.5bn) and SME lending (\u00a34.1bn) advances as firms operating in this area mobilise to meet changing consumer habits. </p><p> Emerging risks and new tech could drive disruption in commercial lines insurance equivalent to 25% of current revenues, leading to an estimated market uplift of \u00a327.6bn by 2030. Disruption opportunities in the life and pensions sector could also benefit the market by \u00a315.7bn.  Almost a quarter (24%) of the personal insurance market could be disrupted by 2030 due to the changing nature of risk and better data, resulting in a \u00a36.6bn boost. New entrants are already capitalising on the demand for new, more customer-centric and digitally enabled services. Examples include apps supported by AI-driven digital assistants allowing customers to buy and manage their home and rental insurance policies with minimal effort.  Globally, SME\u2019s financial needs are increasingly being met by new players such as the internet giants. In the UK, big tech or smaller digital challengers could dominate the currently underserved micro-SME lending sector, due to the better information they possess and the improved user experience they can offer. This could kickstart commerce worth an extra \u00a34.1bn (37%) of today\u2019s SME market.  With consumer habits continuing to evolve rapidly alongside major advances in technology, industry giants, who still hold the customer share advantage, will vie with start ups and major tech firms for the new business, the analysis finds.     Shazia Azim, Head of Strategy and COO of Financial Services at PwC, said:     \u201cOur analysis shows an upswing of more than \u00a3100bn by 2030, if sector incumbents and new entrants successfully horizon scan evolving consumer needs across key areas including insurance, SME lending and asset management.  \u201cFinTech presents a fantastic opportunity for financial services businesses to harness technological disruption and help shape the future of the industry. Crucially it helps level the playing field for those start ups and scale ups using and developing cutting edge technologies. As a result, these newer players will be better equipped to battle for market share with the larger firms still adapting to the rapid pace of change.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that firms operating in a sector where the consumer is becoming more sophisticated and more demanding will have to embrace technological disruption \u2013 or be disrupted themselves.\u201d     Customer appetite, trust, and shifts in macro economic trends influencing customer demand for new products will drive innovation in  five key \u201cenablers\u201d areas, which are weighted in favour of market debutantes.     Technology\u2013 new entrants are cloud-based and put customer experience at the heart of their technology design. Contrast this with some incumbents\u2019 reliance on legacy technology frameworks that depend on systems developed in the 1960s and are still used to support $3 trillion of commercial flows.       Regulation -  challengers are able to create new services and attract customers onto their platforms without having to fulfil the majority of complex licensing requirements required by traditional players.       Switching \u2013  regulation is making switching easier and more straightforward than ever. Challengers are targeting new demographics and creating a clear distinction between old and new.     Talent  \u2013 traditional financial services roles are being replaced and augmented by automation. The focus on data and analytics is creating intense competition for digital and data-savvy talent, to the advantage of tech giants directly aiming to serve the FS sector.       Funding - the relative size and availability of funding     First mover advantage often belongs to the big tech players or start-ups. However these groups do not have a monopoly on the creative mindset, responsive business models and transformational approach needed for operating in a disrupted landscape.  Sector incumbents can combine those attributes with their established relationships and foundation of trust, and consequently be well-placed to service their markets, PwC suggests.     Andrew Kail, head of financial services and partner at PwC, said:     \u201cThere are plenty of examples of disruption taking place across the financial services market. Traditional firms and fintech start-ups are offering consumers new ways to transact and manage their money. Illustrating the competition in the market, digital players from beyond the sector are creating financial services from scratch to produce attractive new products.     \u201cWe\u2019re only seeing the beginning of the disruptive change that will change the face of every sub-sector, from insurance to asset and wealth management and from transactions to pensions. And for firms operating in any of those markets, tomorrow\u2019s competition could come from anywhere.  \u201cPwC is currently working with more than 800 UK and global businesses on financial services technology projects.  \u201cConsumers and businesses using innovative products want more tailored, more efficient and more secure technology. In order to meet this demand we may also see more joint ventures between the behemoths and the new entrants to combine forces around market share and new product.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1007511120190507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2B-PT01-DXCW-D2WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1015\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 7, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The \u201cHarnessing the power of disruption\u201d report, released today, identifies key financial services areas open to - and already being impacted by -  advances in technology, changes in demographics and customer behaviour. In key areas including insurance, lending, savings and investments, and transactions, the analysis charts the \u201cdisruption\u201d occurring and quantifies the positive impact on consumers, businesses and the financial services industry serving them.  Of the total \u00a3106bn of estimated new business by 2030, PwC estimates more than half (\u00a353.6bn) will be driven by insurance (\u00a349.5bn) and SME lending (\u00a34.1bn) advances as firms operating in this area mobilise to meet changing consumer habits. </p><p> Emerging risks and new tech could drive disruption in commercial lines insurance equivalent to 25% of current revenues, leading to an estimated market uplift of \u00a327.6bn by 2030. Disruption opportunities in the life and pensions sector could also benefit the market by \u00a315.7bn.  Almost a quarter (24%) of the personal insurance market could be disrupted by 2030 due to the changing nature of risk and better data, resulting in a \u00a36.6bn boost. New entrants are already capitalising on the demand for new, more customer-centric and digitally enabled services. Examples include apps supported by AI-driven digital assistants allowing customers to buy and manage their home and rental insurance policies with minimal effort.  Globally, SME\u2019s financial needs are increasingly being met by new players such as the internet giants. In the UK, big tech or smaller digital challengers could dominate the currently underserved micro-SME lending sector, due to the better information they possess and the improved user experience they can offer. This could kickstart commerce worth an extra \u00a34.1bn (37%) of today\u2019s SME market.  With consumer habits continuing to evolve rapidly alongside major advances in technology, industry giants, who still hold the customer share advantage, will vie with start ups and major tech firms for the new business, the analysis finds.     Shazia Azim, Head of Strategy and COO of Financial Services at PwC, said:     \u201cOur analysis shows an upswing of more than \u00a3100bn by 2030, if sector incumbents and new entrants successfully horizon scan evolving consumer needs across key areas including insurance, SME lending and asset management.  \u201cFinTech presents a fantastic opportunity for financial services businesses to harness technological disruption and help shape the future of the industry. Crucially it helps level the playing field for those start ups and scale ups using and developing cutting edge technologies. As a result, these newer players will be better equipped to battle for market share with the larger firms still adapting to the rapid pace of change.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that firms operating in a sector where the consumer is becoming more sophisticated and more demanding will have to embrace technological disruption \u2013 or be disrupted themselves.\u201d     Customer appetite, trust, and shifts in macro economic trends influencing customer demand for new products will drive innovation in  five key \u201cenablers\u201d areas, which are weighted in favour of market debutantes.     Technology\u2013 new entrants are cloud-based and put customer experience at the heart of their technology design. Contrast this with some incumbents\u2019 reliance on legacy technology frameworks that depend on systems developed in the 1960s and are still used to support $3 trillion of commercial flows.       Regulation -  challengers are able to create new services and attract customers onto their platforms without having to fulfil the majority of complex licensing requirements required by traditional players.       Switching \u2013  regulation is making switching easier and more straightforward than ever. Challengers are targeting new demographics and creating a clear distinction between old and new.     Talent  \u2013 traditional financial services roles are being replaced and augmented by automation. The focus on data and analytics is creating intense competition for digital and data-savvy talent, to the advantage of tech giants directly aiming to serve the FS sector.       Funding - the relative size and availability of funding     First mover advantage often belongs to the big tech players or start-ups. However these groups do not have a monopoly on the creative mindset, responsive business models and transformational approach needed for operating in a disrupted landscape.  Sector incumbents can combine those attributes with their established relationships and foundation of trust, and consequently be well-placed to service their markets, PwC suggests.     Andrew Kail, head of financial services and partner at PwC, said:     \u201cThere are plenty of examples of disruption taking place across the financial services market. Traditional firms and fintech start-ups are offering consumers new ways to transact and manage their money. Illustrating the competition in the market, digital players from beyond the sector are creating financial services from scratch to produce attractive new products.     \u201cWe\u2019re only seeing the beginning of the disruptive change that will change the face of every sub-sector, from insurance to asset and wealth management and from transactions to pensions. And for firms operating in any of those markets, tomorrow\u2019s competition could come from anywhere.  \u201cPwC is currently working with more than 800 UK and global businesses on financial services technology projects.  \u201cConsumers and businesses using innovative products want more tailored, more efficient and more secure technology. In order to meet this demand we may also see more joint ventures between the behemoths and the new entrants to combine forces around market share and new product.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1007511120190507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W29-CY81-DXCW-D37B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1015\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 7, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Today, consumers connect with major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn each day before they even leave the house.</p><p>Intact sees the potential for these tech firms to also sell auto, home and travel insurance policies at the click of a mouse - and that time might be close at hand.</p><p>Googlewill soon test out GoogleCompare, which is an auto insurance shopping site, in the United States, according to a recent report by Reuters.</p><p>These companies \"who have strong brands, who have a very good understanding of consumer behaviour, who have agile technology, [to] come in and start disrupting how the business is distributed,\" Mr. Brindamour said.</p><p>Intact distinguishes between competitors in \"manufacturing,\" which is the actual underwriting of insurance policies, and \"distribution,\" which is the sale of those policies to the consumer either directly or through broker networks. Intact already has more than 17 per cent of the property and casualty insurance market and intends to grow that share.</p><p>It's the distribution side where Mr. Brindamour said the company is \"getting prepared\" for new players.</p><p>They aren't alone. Other financial institutions, including banks, life insurers and asset managers, are looking to social media, mobile apps and other yet-to-bedreamed-up technology to target consumers in new ways and meet them where they are: online.</p><p>Now, Intact says building its digital presence is a priority, and intends to make its branding more streamlined and stronger. \"We're putting a lot of emphasis on digital leadership,\" Mr. Brindamour said. The company operates under the banners Belairdirect, Grey Power and BrokerLink as well as Intact.</p><p>Technology is already reshaping Intact's business through telematics, which use wireless and digital technologies that send and receive information within a vehicle. Some insurers have rolled out telematics that monitor drivers in exchange for discounts for good behaviour.</p><p>Intact launched its telematics (also known as usage-based insurance) program in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick about a year ago and now has more than 60,000 customers enrolled in the program. It is preparing to launch such monitoring systems in Alberta, pending regulators' approval.</p><p>All that data can be useful, but Intact is still sorting out how best to use it. \"I think we're learning to deal with the massive amount of new data coming our way,\" Mr. Brindamour said.</p><p>Intact benefited from improvements in weather conditions and favourable underwriting results in this quarter, and quarterly profit nearly doubled. That led the company to fourth-quarter earnings of $205-million from $107-million a year earlier, handily beating analyst expectations.</p><p>The company hiked its dividend by 10 per cent to 53 cents a share on Wednesday, reflecting that 2015 marks the 10th-straight year of increases for the company since its initial public offering in late 2004. Shares of Intact, which was formerly known as ING Canada Inc., have produced a 274per-cent total return since then.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20150205rbswintact</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F7B-Y4S1-JCRP-C02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Predicting the future is a tough task and in an industry thats changing as fast as financial services, thats even harder, but as we look ahead into 2019, there are some cues we can take from the focus banks, insurers and asset managers are making in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia Pacific to revamp their technology for smoother integration with tech giants. The year ahead should also see financial firms making more use of big data to launch entirely new products and develop more tailored pricing, as well as increase their efforts on digital solutions for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporate banking. This list is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully its a good start to get people excited about 2019. So, here are some of the top trends to keep an eye on this year: 1) Technology upgrades for better integration with digital giants: For established banks and insurers, its important to upgrade and elevate their enterprise technology and expertise to the same level of digital sophistication of Internet giants and platform players such as Line in Thailand and Japan, Alibaba in China or Flipkart in India. </p><p>That will help them with breakthrough, more integrated financial services products. Nowadays, for example, you have leading insurance players in India, Singapore and other countries in Asia Pacific selling a number of protection products through e-commerce sites, ride-hailing apps or online travel companies. Banks in Thailand are also partnering with digital giants to make sure they are an integral part of their customers daily life. The question every bank and insurance Chief Information Officer should be asking now is: how can I make sure we have the right technology and culture in place so that we can integrate our products and services and be nimble enough to partner with the big tech/digital players? 2) Enhanced pricing with digital tools and wider use of big data: Digitisation will need to move from optimizing the overall customer experience to product design and be more central in developing sophisticated pricing models. Financial services firms should make more use of big data for the purpose of pricing, especially for segments where structured data availability is very limited and particularly where pricing is limited. Having that ready will help banks and insurers develop and offer structured bundled products: think having your car insurance, along with home insurance, along with a savings account as one offering. In Thailand, for example, we already have insurance companies using tools such as Internet of Things (IOT) devices to collect more data in order to provide custom pricing, a trend that should become more prevalent as the technology and know-how around big data analytics gets more widespread. 3) Think small to make it big: There will be a greater focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand and other Southeast Asia markets in the coming year, given the macro outlook for greater protectionism and rising nationalism around the world. Financial services firms should heed that call and focus on offering more banking and insurance products to SMEs, but in order to better service that segment theyll have to use more big data for the purpose of underwriting policies, for example, and use digital channels for smarter and more efficient distribution of financial products to SMEs, which has been lacking in most countries in the region. 4) Direct-to-consumer (D2C) links to improve governance pitfalls: In a world with increased scrutiny of conduct by financial service providers, insurance companies and wealth management firms will have to focus on building a more direct relationship with their customers, rather than having an over-reliance on commission-based relationships via agents, as these can be prone to poorer/weaker governance. Digital will be the fastest, most efficient way for financial firms to do that, given the prevalence of smartphones and other devices at the hands of millions of people in the region. Companies will likely begin to sell services and products through their apps directly to consumers, bypassing the middlemen and creating a more agile and efficient business. 5) The evolution of human-assisted roboadvice: Fully automated wealth management services and roboadvice tools have been all the rage the past years. We will see a much greater level of simplification and digitization in the area of wealth management, with an increased focus and greater maturity in the area of robo-assisted manual advisor. This hybrid model will combine bid data that financial firms have been building and optimizing the past years with new analytics tools that human advisors can use to create smarter, more nimble and personalized solutions with a human touch that customers want.

Predicting the future is a tough task and in an industry thats changing as fast as financial services, thats even harder, but as we look ahead into 2019, there are some cues we can take from the focus banks, insurers and asset managers are making in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia Pacific to revamp their technology for smoother integration with tech giants. The year ahead should also see financial firms making more use of big data to launch entirely new products and develop more tailored pricing, as well as increase their efforts on digital solutions for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporate banking. This list is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully its a good start to get people excited about 2019. So, here are some of the top trends to keep an eye on this year: 1) Technology upgrades for better integration with digital giants: For established banks and insurers, its important to upgrade and elevate their enterprise technology and expertise to the same level of digital sophistication of Internet giants and platform players such as Line in Thailand and Japan, Alibaba in China or Flipkart in India. </p><p>That will help them with breakthrough, more integrated financial services products. Nowadays, for example, you have leading insurance players in India, Singapore and other countries in Asia Pacific selling a number of protection products through e-commerce sites, ride-hailing apps or online travel companies. Banks in Thailand are also partnering with digital giants to make sure they are an integral part of their customers daily life. The question every bank and insurance Chief Information Officer should be asking now is: how can I make sure we have the right technology and culture in place so that we can integrate our products and services and be nimble enough to partner with the big tech/digital players? 2) Enhanced pricing with digital tools and wider use of big data: Digitisation will need to move from optimizing the overall customer experience to product design and be more central in developing sophisticated pricing models. Financial services firms should make more use of big data for the purpose of pricing, especially for segments where structured data availability is very limited and particularly where pricing is limited. Having that ready will help banks and insurers develop and offer structured bundled products: think having your car insurance, along with home insurance, along with a savings account as one offering. In Thailand, for example, we already have insurance companies using tools such as Internet of Things (IOT) devices to collect more data in order to provide custom pricing, a trend that should become more prevalent as the technology and know-how around big data analytics gets more widespread. 3) Think small to make it big: There will be a greater focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand and other Southeast Asia markets in the coming year, given the macro outlook for greater protectionism and rising nationalism around the world. Financial services firms should heed that call and focus on offering more banking and insurance products to SMEs, but in order to better service that segment theyll have to use more big data for the purpose of underwriting policies, for example, and use digital channels for smarter and more efficient distribution of financial products to SMEs, which has been lacking in most countries in the region. 4) Direct-to-consumer (D2C) links to improve governance pitfalls: In a world with increased scrutiny of conduct by financial service providers, insurance companies and wealth management firms will have to focus on building a more direct relationship with their customers, rather than having an over-reliance on commission-based relationships via agents, as these can be prone to poorer/weaker governance. Digital will be the fastest, most efficient way for financial firms to do that, given the prevalence of smartphones and other devices at the hands of millions of people in the region. Companies will likely begin to sell services and products through their apps directly to consumers, bypassing the middlemen and creating a more agile and efficient business. 5) The evolution of human-assisted roboadvice: Fully automated wealth management services and roboadvice tools have been all the rage the past years. We will see a much greater level of simplification and digitization in the area of wealth management, with an increased focus and greater maturity in the area of robo-assisted manual advisor. This hybrid model will combine bid data that financial firms have been building and optimizing the past years with new analytics tools that human advisors can use to create smarter, more nimble and personalized solutions with a human touch that customers want.

Yet they have amassed only 3.5 percent of the total $1.04 trillion in banking and payment revenues so-far in US.<br/> In the UK, new entrants have captured 14 percent of the total (EURO)206 billion or $238.45 billion in industry revenues, with the majority going to non-bank payments companies.<br/> Accenture assessed more than 20,000 banking and payments institutions across 7 markets around the world to determine the level of change that digital technologies have brought about in banking.<br/> Since the financial downturn, a growing number of companies across the world have sought to position themselves as cheaper and more user-friendly alternatives to banks by making better use of new technology.<br/> Banking and payments institutions have decreased by nearly 20 percent from 2005 to 2017. Still, one in six current institutions is what Accenture considers a new entrant, or companies that have entered the market since 2005.<br/> More than half of new current accounts opened in the United States have been captured by three large banks, which have had more money to invest in digital than smaller regional players.<br/> In the UK the situation has been different, thanks in part to a push from regulators aimed at fostering greater competition in the financial sector and diminishing the dominance of large banks.<br/> New entrants account for 63 percent of financial players in the UK. The report also found new entrants are taking over one third of new revenue, pointing to their potential to pose a greater competitive threat going forward.<br/> In Europe, including the UK, 20 percent of banking and payments institutions are new entrants and have captured nearly 7 percent of total banking revenues.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INFOTC-n10703490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INFOTC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THG-7XP1-DYDW-74G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423499</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"344\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Infotechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 18, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

What's more, tech giants Google and Apple had stepped into the space by offering similar features, he says.Rather than shutting down the company, its leaders and investors agreed to roll Yozio's capital into a new venture based on an idea from the startup's engineers, Daligault says. The company, under the new name Findera[2], would turn the tables on big tech by becoming an inventive little competitor to an entrenched leader in its field, LinkedIn. (Yozio's investors includedFoundation Capital,Illuminate Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, WIN Network, and Morado Ventures.)Daligault joined with other co-founders of Findera who saw an opening for a faster, free alternative to LinkedIn for individuals and small businesses that want to find new professional contacts or potential hires. </p><p>Rather than basing its service on a social media model, as LinkedIn does, Findera built a search engine that taps into professional profiles it compiles from public and private sources.The Findera service, which has been operating in a private alpha mode, launched for public use this week. Anyone can query the database that, thus far, covers 130 million people who work at about five million companies. Users can search based on multiple variables\u2014for example, someone could seek the names of marketing directors for high-revenue enterprises within a specified industry. Users can also sort the profiles they find into an unlimited number of lists for different purposes, export the lists to spreadsheets, and share them with colleagues. Creating an account and a user profile is optional, but more features, such as exporting lists, are available to account holders.Daligault, now Findera's COO, says a series of other new features are in development, such as allowing users to post an 'I'm hiring' sign on their profiles, and add a free job listings page detailing their open positions. This mechanism could be broadened to serve the goals of other professionals, such as journalists reaching out to potential sources, he says.Eventually, Findera plans to offer search features based on its analysis of the associations among its users, gleaned through its graph search technology.'This will take time,' Daligault says. 'It will take a lot of adoption to make it useful.'Findera's progress may be heavily influenced by the evolving global regulatory environment around individual data privacy, and a growing public awareness of the issue.When Yozio's founders fixed on their new vision for Findera in February of 2017, Facebook had already been investigated by the Federal Trade Commission[3] for allegedly deceptive practices that the agency said made it unclear to users how data from their personal profiles could be shared with outsiders. But that probe was a minor blip on the radar compared to the uproar early this year when Facebook revealed that about 87 million of its personal profiles had been extracted[4] by other companies including Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used them to target political ads to voters during the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential election.Since then, Congress has widened its scrutiny of online privacy practices to include other tech giants. On the eve of Findera's public launch this week, a Senate committee held another hearing[5] on consumer data privacy, where executives from Google, Twitter, Amazon, Apple and AT...ere called to appear. While Congress has been holding hearings and mulling possible federal privacy regulations, individual states, including California, have already passed their own data privacy statutes.On top of all that, enforcement began in May for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation[6](GDPR), a stringent regulatory framework that imposes severe penalties on companies that violate the privacy of individuals whose data comes under the E.U.'s jurisdiction.Findera's roadmap for attracting users already demonstrates the impact of the GDPR on U.S. tech companies that would otherwise aspire to a create a global user network. In the startup's terms of service, Findera advises: 'If you are a resident of the E.U., Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland, you will not be able to create a Findera account at this time.' Other companies have also roped off the E.U. and other jurisdictions for the time being, while they figure out whether operating there would be worth the expense of complying with the GDPR and other national privacy regulations.Findera freely shared its terms of service, and Daligault welcomed a discussion with Xconomy about the way the company might have to tailor its offerings and craft its user settings to keep pace with the regulatory environment regarding data privacy. In a way, Findera enjoys the luxury of being informed about the controversies that have already arisen over data privacy while its search engine is still very new and its policies can be quickly adjusted. Daligault says he's wary that Findera could be seen as 'the next Cambridge Analytica.'Daligault says Findera can offer something valuable to self-employed people and small companies that lack access to the kinds of databases and technical resources available to big, moneyed businesses looking for professional contacts.'People who can pay get all that information,' Daligault says.Findera buys access to some of these private databases of people and their work roles. It also continually crawls the Web to find current facts about workforce members, and structures that scattered data to bring it together and make it searchable. For example, it might find someone's e-mail address on their blog site, even though it isn't displayed on their public LinkedIn profile, Daligault says.Findera is trying to address a major pain point in forming new professional relationships\u2014actually being able to get through to someone once you've found them. People often withhold their e-mail addresses on their public LinkedIn profiles. LinkedIn users can send each other messages through the website if they've already accepted each other as professional connections. But users trying to reach out to a new contact might need to pay for a LinkedIn Premium account in order to send a message through the company's InMail feature, or hunt among their own connections for a colleague who could introduce them.Findera is contemplating several ways to facilitate more direct contact with new work associates. When users set up their Findera accounts, using a Google or Microsoft account, the company's terms and conditions allow it to scan the metadata of their e-mails and calendars. Users can cancel this permission at sign-up or any time later, the company says.Daligault says collecting data about a user's connections through their e-mail headings and calendars helps Findera build a map of associations that is more representative of the user's 'true connections' than those on LinkedIn, which, he says, encourages people to invite a broader array of more distant associates into their networks. In the future, Findera's social map could help its users find one of their current colleagues who actually knows a prospective new contact well enough to effect an introduction, he says.But as Findera scans a user's e-mail and calendar metadata, does it also extract the e-mail addresses of the account holder's contacts, and use those addresses to build out its own profiles of those co-workers and friends, who may not be Findera account holders? Yes, Daligault says.Whether Findera could someday be vulnerable to regulatory action or public resistance to this kind of data-mining remains Reprints[7] | Share: <url

This is a venture that boasts a growing line of products that, as the name suggests, uses olive oil as its base ingredient, but separates itself from others that do the same by the all-natural quality of every item on the ingredient list.

It is an inexact measure of how effectively a product or service is gaining acceptance, credibility, and, yes, sales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, in many ways, the first annual Accelerator Awards, staged recently by Valley Venture Mentors, represented a highly competitive contest of traction - which of the 30 companies in the first cohort of VVM's Accelerator Program had it, and which ones could gain a lot more of it if they had some more capital to work with.</p><p>If the numbers written on the ceremonial checks handed out at the awards ceremony on April 30 are any indication - and most involved would say they are - then Jessica Lauren has certainly achieved some traction with Olive Natural Beauty Inc.</p><p>This is a venture that boasts a growing line of products that, as the name suggests, uses olive oil as its base ingredient, but separates itself from others that do the same by the all-natural quality of every item on the ingredient list.</p><p>Lauren won a check for $35,000, the largest amount handed out that night by a panel of judges, each of whom had, in essence, $20,000 to apportion and were free to dispense it any way they chose. Lauren intends to stretch those dollars about as far as humanly possible, allocating them for everything from more aggressive marketing programs to building inventory to taking on a strategic partner, as she seeks to take her company to the proverbial next stage.</p><p>\"It costs money to run a business, and anything would really help push us to the next level,\" she said, adding quickly that the amount on her check constitutes far more than 'anything.' \"This is going to be huge for us.\"</p><p>For this issue and its focus on entrepreneurship, BusinessWest talked at length with Lauren and others from that first cohort who successfully communicated a level of traction for their businesses to both their peers and those aforementioned judges.</p><p>Dave Waymouth, for example, took home a $32,500 check to advance his veture, PetSimpl, which markets a device - one he believes is a vast improvement over anything currently available - that can help pet owners keep track of their furry loved ones.</p><p>Lightspeed Manufacturing in Haverhill is now producing the so-called Pip, named after Waymouth's terrier mix, which in many ways inspired this business (more on that story later).</p><p>Waymouth is taking orders, and he expects his product to officially hit the market this summer and be in several outlets in time for the holidays.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jake Mazur and his partner, Soham Bhatt, hit their highly competitive market with Artifact Cider roughly a year ago. They now have their product in 40 liquor stores and eight bars along the I-91 corridor, and intend to use the $20,000 they won to help pay for a part-time salesperson to increase their cider's reach and strengthen its brand.</p><p>The accelerator project's first cohort has 27 more stories like these. They are all different, but there are many common denominators, especially that quest for traction.</p><p>Getting a Grip</p><p>'I love you guys, but ... no way.'</p><p>That's one of the qualitative assessments used in conjunction with actual numbers (1-9) on the score sheets employed by so-called 'herds' within that first accelerator cohort as the entrepreneurs judged their peers and fellow competitors in one of the early phases of the process that decided who received checks on April and how big they were.</p><p>That phrase obviously pertained to someone who would score a '1' or '2,' and thus it wasn't used often, if at all, said Paul Silva, executive director of VVM, as he noted that the 30 companies chosen to be in that first cohort were clearly among the more promising startup ventures in this region - and well beyond, as things turned out.</p><p>Other assessments, used far more often, included 'weak story and not enough customer validation,' somewhat agree/you got me onto the right side of the fence,' 'believable story but not enough customer validation,' and 'a rare unicorn of perfection,' which would constitute a '9.'</p><p>The unicorn has become the unofficial symbol of VVM, and it was on display prominently at the awards ceremony. It represents an ambitious goal, something rare, but also (at least in the VVM universe) something real.</p><p>Finding a unicorn is the unstated mission of all the entrepreneurs involved with the accelerator program, said Silva, noting that these individuals went through a rugged period of learning and assessment designed to provide tough love, mentoring, and, for several ventures, very-much-needed cold, hard cash.</p><p>Those aforementioned herds were comprised of five entrepreneurs each, and the herds did not judge those in their own group, said Silva, adding that they gathered scores to six questions (statements, actually) - ranging from 'the company has proven, in-depth understanding of their customers and the customers' pains' to 'the company has a proven revenue model, logical pricing, and has an accurate handle on all applicable costs; they know what can kill them!' - to effectively narrow the field to 12 finalists.</p><p>This smaller field was then assessed by the group of 14 judges, who are also investors, who heard 10-minute presentations from the finalists and then could follow up with more questions and input during a trade-show' period before the awards presentation.</p><p>Lauren obviously impressed those judges, with both what she's accomplished to date and the potential to soar much higher.</p><p>Like the others we spoke with, Lauren said her venture was born through a mix of necessity and both experience with other products on the market and frustration with them.</p><p>\"Growing up in an Italian family, olive oil was an important part of our lifestyle in terms of being healthy and taking care of yourself and your skin,\" she explained. \"And when I went to college, I went to work for an apothecary, and that experience really opened my eyes to the cosmetics industry in the U.S., because there are literally no regulations - there are tons of ingredients that go into cosmetic products that are not regulated or tested or approved by the FDA or any other organization.\"</p><p>What evolved over time, then, was a business focused on the many beneficial properties of olive oil and featuring the transparency and natural ingredients missing from most products made in the U.S.</p><p>She started with a lab in her kitchen, testing various products and providing them to friends and relatives, who started asking for more. And, as she said herself, \"the rest is history.\"</p><p>Explaining in more detail, she said olive oil has become, in many respects, a gourmet product. She is riding that wave, certainly, but in a unique way.</p><p>Her products have achieved traction in a number of ways, she said, noting that she's sold more than 400,000 units to date (like a true entrepreneur, she got more precise, offering the number 404,000). The products are sold through 30 retailers in the U.S. and Canada, and Lauren is in serious negotiations with a major chain she opted not to name that will greatly improve that number if all goes well.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, she's getting some solid reviews, which are crucial because of the sheer volume of competition.</p><p>For example, Michelle Phan, founder of the website ipsy.com, which helps consumers wade through the myriad products on the market through reviews and recommendations, tried some of Lauren's lip balm and discussed it glowingly in one of her online videos.</p><p>As part of that PR and marketing push toward which Lauren wants to direct some of her winnings, she's striving to win some exposure in People, Good Housekeeping, and other publications with a strong focus on health and beauty and that feature companies making such products.</p><p>If all goes as planned - and she expects it will - sales volume, currently around $250,000, should eclipse $1 million in 2016.</p><p>A Breed Apart</p><p>Waymouth said Pip, his terrier mix, went missing early one evening a few years ago. As anyone who's been through such an ordeal would understand, this was quite a traumatic experience.</p><p>\"We live near busy roads, and he sees every car as something with a friend in it,\" he explained, adding that, fortunately, the dog was found just a few hours later.</p><p>But the experience left Waymouth frustrated by the pet-protection products available on the market - and determined to build the proverbial better mousetrap. He calls it a \"LoJack for your pet,\" a reference to the vehicle-tracking system designed to help police recover stolen vehicles.</p><p>\"I'm a big tech guy, so I assumed there were GPS trackers that did this,\" he said of his thought process after Pip - now the company's 'spokesdog' and the face of the venture, pictured on the business cards and website - was found safe. \"But when I looked, everything was too big for him, or it had horrible battery life.\"</p><p>At the time, he was enrolled in the MBA program at the Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst, and decided to enter a business-pitch competition and make his case for a more effective product. He finished third in that contest and then went through several more rounds where he flushed out the business model and came up with a way to make the product smaller and with longer battery life.</p><p>He eventually prevailed in the extended competition, winning a total of $30,000 to build a prototype. He was then accepted into MassChallenge, which helped create connections to Verizon and other strategic partners and make the concept reality.</p><p>The Pip uses mostly the same cutting-edge technology found in a smartphone to send a text message to the pet owner when the animal in question leaves a so-called 'safe zone' - the owner's home and area around it, as well as a several-foot-wide area around the pet while it's being taken for a walk, for example. With the press of a button, the owner gets turn-by-turn directions to locate the animal. When the pet is in that safe zone, the device stays in a low-power mode, Waymouth explained, thus greatly extending battery life.</p><p>The first manufacturing run will be for 1,000 of the devices, he said, adding that many orders came in through a Kickstarter campaign, and others continue to trickle in through the website. That will be followed by a run of 5,000 and perhaps another of that size if demand warrants.</p><p>The Pip will soon be available on Amazon, and Waymouth is expecting that it will become an in-demand item for the upcoming holiday season. The current sticker price is $99, with a $5 month charge for the cellular connection, or $199 for the 'unlimited option.' Over time, and as the technology improves, he expects those price points to come down.</p><p>While getting ready for the Christmas season, Waymouth is also in hard pursuit of capital for the venture, and is finding many interested parties.</p><p>\"I've gotten more interest than I can really deal with, which is a great problem to have,\" he explained, noting that negotiations continue on a first round of financing he expects will approach or exceed $500,000.</p><p>One of those interested parties is the Springfield Venture Fund, he said, adding that its participation will require him to move his headquarters from Northampton to Springfield (that's one of the conditions of the fund, backed by MassMutual). Either way, the company fully expects to stay within the 413 area code.</p><p>\"We're planning on staying in this region,\" he said. \"We want to be a Western Mass. success story.\"</p><p>Core Business</p><p>Those same sentiments were echoed by Mazur, who said his aptly named product is fast gaining that all-important traction in this area.</p><p>Elaborating, he gave a rather loose definition of an 'artifact' as something created by man, and from another era, that's been discovered or rediscovered. Hard cider, he went on, was a popular and potent potable in New England a few centuries ago, primarily because the soil here was more suitable for growing apples than it was for cultivating the hops needed for beer.</p><p>And cider remained popular until Prohibition, when many of the apple trees planted more than 100 years earlier were cut down, and in the time it took to grow new ones, many Americans had switched allegiance to beer, he said, continuing the history lesson. But over the past five years or so, hard cider has made a comeback, with a number of products occupying package-store shelves.</p><p>The Artifact Cider Project, as it's formally known, is part of the wave, said Mazur, but the product differentiates itself in what is now the fastest-growing segment of the liquor market by the way it's made - with local apples and unique blends.</p><p>The story begins, sort of, several years ago, when Mazur was diagnosed with celiac disease, an autoimmune disease of the small intestine caused by a reaction to gluten, which is found in wheat and similar crops, including hops.</p><p>\"I couldn't have beer, so, prompted by that diagnosis, I discovered cider,\" he said, adding that this interest was shared by Bhatt, a friend since middle school whose aptitude in science, engineering, and culinary arts has effectively complemented Mazur's background in business - he was a consultant for several years - and, most recently, farming.</p><p>\"Local agriculture is my passion in life, so Artifact is a combination of our respective professional backgrounds,\" he noted, adding that the venture was launched on a virtual shoestring in 2013, and the first cider was introduced in June 2014.</p><p>Today, the company has three brands, or blends: 'New World,' the first product; 'Wild Thing,' described as a \"supremely tart, sessionable\" cider; and 'Colrain,' named after the Franklin County town where the apples used to make it grow.</p><p>They come in kegs and 22-ounce bottles, or \"bombers,\" said Mazur, adding that the obvious goal moving forward is to sell more of them, and the $20,000 won through the accelerator program will certainly help with that assignment.</p><p>\"One of the things we want to do with the money we received through Valley Venture Mentors is hire a part-time salesperson to help build the brand,\" he explained. \"We're mostly focused on our existing accounts; we're not trying to grow too quickly.</p><p>\"Eventually, we'd like to get our cider into Eastern Mass. and Boston, but we're really focused on the Pioneer Valley as our home base,\" Mazur went on. \"We want to be successful here before we expand too broadly.\"</p><p>Two marketing interns, one from Smith College, the other from Mount Holyoke, will be working for the company this summer, he noted, adding that they'll be handling, among other things, cider tastings and other events to introduce or reintroduce people to cider and the Artifact label.</p><p>Money Talks</p><p>Speaking for all those who took home ceremonial checks from VVM, Mazur said the money comes at an important time and provides needed fuel as the company looks to grow its brand.</p><p>\"We're a small company, so getting capital at this stage is going to change things quite a bit for us,\" he noted. \"We really bootstrapped this company - we started it with our own personal finances, and we've done everything on the cheap. We've made the money we started with go quite a long way.\"</p><p>Such is life for the startup business owner looking to take an idea from drawing board to reality - and gain that precious commodity called traction.</p><p>The companies in this first cohort all have some of it. The challenge - and the mission - is to earn more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BSWEST-3728776491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BSWEST2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GB9-FBD1-JD2T-F3SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 BusinessWest</copyright><publicationName>BusinessWest</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1049-9822</issn><volume>Vol. 32</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>May 18, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Startups</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Competition</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Entrepreneurs</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>CLASSIFICATION: </className><className> Small business</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00096KX</classCode><className>NEW BUSINESSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DFLI</classCode><className>STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N441320MM</classCode><className>TIRE DEALERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp; PARTNERSHIPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001319</classCode><className>PETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000017</classCode><className>ADHESIVES &amp; SEALANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001082</classCode><className>MARKETING CAMPAIGNS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N441320MM</classCode><className>TIRE DEALERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001313</classCode><className>PERSONAL FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

His charter for digital human rights requires action from us all. Bryan Appleyard reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">--------------------</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bestselling novelist and now anti-Silicon Valley activist Dave Eggers recently gave a lecture to 300 high-school pupils in Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it as the platform of their parents and grandparents,\" he tells me. \"They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p>The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook.</p><p>Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cack-handed cover-up and, earlier this month, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without.</p><p>Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p>\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture.</p><p>She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of LeanIn.org, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\".</p><p>But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that s.... doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfair-competition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers was scheduled to give overnight (NZT) for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London.</p><p>He was to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells' 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online.</p><p>Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move towards every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world.</p><p>\"An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty- Four for millennials and snowflakes.</p><p>The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during three- minute \"bathroom breaks\".</p><p>The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.</p><p>\"So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all,\" says Eggers. \"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything?</p><p>\"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a common sense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\"</p><p>This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes. They should have a more humble approach to their work and their place in the world. Also an awareness of their power and an awareness that they are just a tech company, sellers of emojis and frivolities. If they were a little bit more humble from top to bottom, I think we could have a conversation about regulation and basic human rights.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the US political landscape is now so opposed to regulation of any kind, nothing is likely to happen. Eggers also sees little hope that other obvious ways to tame Silicon Valley will be used - for instance, legally defining the giants as publishers, which would make them responsible for their content, or breaking them up with competition laws.</p><p>\"There's no appetite for these things. The last time major monopolies were broken up was the phone companies and that was 40 years ago.\"</p><p>They are publishers, because these words online are permanent: they are able to be seen by thousands and millions of people. Of course they're publishers. But they've been dodging that and they will continue to do so. For whatever reason, tech companies remain above the law.\"</p><p>We are all to blame, he says. Users submit to highly addictive software and gadgets, affecting themselves and their children in the process.</p><p>\"The more we require schoolchildren to do their work online, to spend more time in front of their screens, the more we are guiding them into a world we know is not good for them.\"</p><p>He compares the state of the internet companies to that of Big Tobacco in the early 1990s: the evidence against them is overwhelming but still we remain addicts.</p><p>Eggers himself uses a basic LG flip phone. He writes on a 14-year-old Apple Mac that is not connected to the internet. He checks his emails on another machine a couple of times a day.</p><p>\"All the old software still works and I don't have to submit myself to indentured servitude to Adobe or some other company.\"</p><p>Overall, though, he's optimistic. The Texas teenagers were no longer in thrall to the Valley giants and regarded their parents' screen addiction with dismay.</p><p>He even detects signs that Zuckerberg is waking from his moral slumber, putting money into philanthropy and maybe even considering the possibility that he does not own the future. A lengthening list of smart Valley apostates are leaving, in disgust, these companies that peddle addiction.</p><p>\"All the power lies in the hands of users. They should use that power and opt out and move their money and their eyeballs elsewhere.</p><p>\"You can enact radical shifts. These things have only been around a few years, but we think of them as a permanent aspect of life. They shouldn't be.\"</p><p>Or, as Michelle Obama said of Sandberg's Lean In manifesto, \"that s... doesn't work all the time\". In the case of tech companies, one might add: \"If ever.\" - Sunday Times, London</p><p>--------------------</p><p>CAPTION:</p><p>Anti-Silicon Valley activist Dave Eggers believes there's something \"culturally wrong\" at Facebook.

His charter for digital human rights requires action from us all. Bryan Appleyard reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">--------------------</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bestselling novelist and now anti-Silicon Valley activist Dave Eggers recently gave a lecture to 300 high-school pupils in Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it as the platform of their parents and grandparents,\" he tells me. \"They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p>The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook.</p><p>Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cack-handed cover-up and, earlier this month, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without.</p><p>Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p>\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture.</p><p>She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of LeanIn.org, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\".</p><p>But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that s.... doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfair-competition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers was scheduled to give overnight (NZT) for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London.</p><p>He was to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells' 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online.</p><p>Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move towards every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world.</p><p>\"An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty- Four for millennials and snowflakes.</p><p>The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during three- minute \"bathroom breaks\".</p><p>The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.</p><p>\"So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all,\" says Eggers. \"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything?</p><p>\"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a common sense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\"</p><p>This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes. They should have a more humble approach to their work and their place in the world. Also an awareness of their power and an awareness that they are just a tech company, sellers of emojis and frivolities. If they were a little bit more humble from top to bottom, I think we could have a conversation about regulation and basic human rights.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the US political landscape is now so opposed to regulation of any kind, nothing is likely to happen. Eggers also sees little hope that other obvious ways to tame Silicon Valley will be used - for instance, legally defining the giants as publishers, which would make them responsible for their content, or breaking them up with competition laws.</p><p>\"There's no appetite for these things. The last time major monopolies were broken up was the phone companies and that was 40 years ago.\"</p><p>They are publishers, because these words online are permanent: they are able to be seen by thousands and millions of people. Of course they're publishers. But they've been dodging that and they will continue to do so. For whatever reason, tech companies remain above the law.\"</p><p>We are all to blame, he says. Users submit to highly addictive software and gadgets, affecting themselves and their children in the process.</p><p>\"The more we require schoolchildren to do their work online, to spend more time in front of their screens, the more we are guiding them into a world we know is not good for them.\"</p><p>He compares the state of the internet companies to that of Big Tobacco in the early 1990s: the evidence against them is overwhelming but still we remain addicts.</p><p>Eggers himself uses a basic LG flip phone. He writes on a 14-year-old Apple Mac that is not connected to the internet. He checks his emails on another machine a couple of times a day.</p><p>\"All the old software still works and I don't have to submit myself to indentured servitude to Adobe or some other company.\"</p><p>Overall, though, he's optimistic. The Texas teenagers were no longer in thrall to the Valley giants and regarded their parents' screen addiction with dismay.</p><p>He even detects signs that Zuckerberg is waking from his moral slumber, putting money into philanthropy and maybe even considering the possibility that he does not own the future. A lengthening list of smart Valley apostates are leaving, in disgust, these companies that peddle addiction.</p><p>\"All the power lies in the hands of users. They should use that power and opt out and move their money and their eyeballs elsewhere.</p><p>\"You can enact radical shifts. These things have only been around a few years, but we think of them as a permanent aspect of life. They shouldn't be.\"</p><p>Or, as Michelle Obama said of Sandberg's Lean In manifesto, \"that s... doesn't work all the time\". In the case of tech companies, one might add: \"If ever.\" - Sunday Times, London</p><p>--------------------</p><p>CAPTION:</p><p>Anti-Silicon Valley activist Dave Eggers believes there's something \"culturally wrong\" at Facebook.
