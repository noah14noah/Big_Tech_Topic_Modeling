Never before have we seen such huge power of \u2018Big Tech\u2019, in terms of their reac...</p><p>Yesterday\u2019s US House Judiciary hearing into the dominance of the four most powerful tech companies in the world - Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - came at a pivotal moment. Never before have we seen such huge power of \u2018Big Tech\u2019, in terms of their reach, wealth and market dominance. All four companies were represented by their CEOs at the hearing. On an individual level, living through a global pandemic, we are all increasingly reliant on their services for so many aspects of our lives, whether news, education, work, food and health information.   And yet while the power of Big Tech has grown to staggering new levels, their regulation and oversight has not. Just look at the negligible tax paid by these companies globally - the amount they have avoided is potentially as high as $100bn over the last 10 years - while public coffers go into freefall, and the level of disinformation facilitated.  The World Health Organisation recently described the false information shared on Facebook about vaccinations as \u201ca major threat to global health that could reverse decades of progress made in tackling preventable diseases.\u201d This is a reality regulators are starting to wake up to, both in the US and Europe.  Of course at its best, technology that allows us to connect with friends and families, to share experiences and to speak out against injustice to a mass global audience is important and powerful. When social media first attracted huge numbers of users it was seen as a \u201cgreat leveller\u201d, a tool for democratising political debate and circumnavigating repressive governments and censorship laws.  The speed at which information can spread has allowed protest networks and other resistant movements to have spectacular spillover effects. It has played an obvious role in the WikiLeaks expos\u00e9s, the Arab Spring uprisings, the Occupy movement, and anti-austerity movements in Europe. Over the past decade, hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo have blossomed into full-blown campaigns for change, as activists have shared their stories and disturbing footage of violence, discrimination and hate.   But the growth of a monopoly of Big Tech firms who control the data and information of billions of people comes at a serious cost. Such a concentration of power in the hands of such a small number of companies poses a danger to democracy - particularly when it comes to platforms like Facebook and Google, which have become new and hotly contested battlegrounds for political campaigns.  These platforms give politicians access to hugely valuable data about the voters they\u2019re trying to reach. One of the best-known examples of this is how Cambridge Analytica claimed it was able to harvest the data of 50 million US citizens through their Facebook profiles as part of their work for the Donald Trump campaign. Although the rules around this have now been tightened up, the ability to sell information about its users is key to Facebook\u2019s profitability.  While it\u2019s not new that communication is fundamental to political campaigning, the tactics being used on digital platforms are still in their infancy. Campaigns now pay a lot of money for experts who can develop strategies for microtargeted ads, which design messages specifically aimed at a group of voters (segmented via the data that is bought from the platforms themselves or off-the shelf audiences from data brokers).  Trump\u2019s digital leads credit their social media strategy with securing his Presidency in 2016. They claim, from 2014 onwards, they would be running between 40,000 to 50,000 variants of their adverts on Facebook each day, testing how they performed in different formats and with slightly different messages aimed at different voter groups. On the day of the third presidential debate in October 2016 - as the traditional media raged about the Access Hollywood tapes - Trump\u2019s campaign was running 175,000 variations of a \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 message on Facebook.   So, as much as new technology offers many new positive ways for reaching voters, it also increases the risk of the process being distorted. For example, by targeting specific segments of the population to suppress their vote, spreading misleading and inflammatory statements or doctoring material via \u2018deepfakes\u2019 to undermine political opponents. And now, as the COVID pandemic changes so many aspects of our lives, some States in the US are pushing for online voting for November\u2019s Presidential election, which raises new risks of interference. The UK\u2019s long-awaited report into Russian interference found that despite the central role played by social media companies in elections, they \u201care failing to play their part\u201d in addressing threats to democracy.   A big part of the problem is that for too long many digital companies have operated as black boxes, without meaningful scrutiny or accountability. A number of these businesses derive the majority of their profit from commodifying our data - also known as surveillance capitalism - and selling it to the highest bidder. Google and Facebook and their subsidiaries make about 83 percent and 99 percent of their respective revenue from selling ads.At yesterday\u2019s Congressional hearing Representative Jaypal laid out data showing Google controls up to 90% of this advertising market. The complex algorithms they use are so secretive we don\u2019t even know on what basis we are shown information and how we have been profiled.  The impact of these political digital strategies may be unclear and, while we\u2019re not suggesting that everyone is naively persuaded by a well designed Facebook ad, the fact campaigns are willing to spend many millions of dollars investing in these platforms suggests they could have a real impact. It is time to lift the lid on online political campaigns and make it harder for political players to target us with information that could either be damaging or false - or simply conceal who is paying for the information or why it\u2019s being seen by some groups of voters and not others. At the moment, information on political advertising - for example via Facebook\u2019s ad libraries - is all too often incomplete, unverified and patchy, with many countries not even fully covered by the limited transparency measures that do exist leaving citizens in the dark.   Yesterday\u2019s historing hearing closed with a robust statement by Representative Cicilline, \u201cThese companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power,\u201d he said on his conclusions from the antitrust investigations. \u201cThis must end. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\u201d  It wasn't always this way, nor do we have to accept the current situation as one that we simply cannot change. Regulators now have a golden opportunity to recalibrate the system and ensure it protects people\u2019s rights and our democracies. The next six months will be quite a ride - the US elections in November will likely see these tensions play out in a dramatic way, follow up from yesterday\u2019s hearing and the EU\u2019s proposal for a Digital Services Act expected later this year is already attracting a huge lobbying battle.

It hasn't had much impact on profits yet</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAST week Schumpeter met two tech tycoons who control businesses in total worth $600bn. In both cases the mayhem around them was what you would expect if Beyonc\u00e9 hit town, minus the musical talent and looks. Hotel floors were locked down by the official secret service; the corridors were crammed with lines of petitioners and in one case a Wall Street boss gatecrashed the room in order to hug his idol.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The message from both titans\u2014you ain't seen nothing yet\u2014was imperious. Over the next decade, they say, conventional industries will face an onslaught from tech competitors wielding vast financial resources, new technologies and massive reserves of data. It is a view that has swept through traditional firms' boardrooms, too, where enthusing about virtual reality and singing the praises of Jeff Bezos, Amazon's boss, is almost obligatory. The notion of disruption, with its promise to destroy the status quo and then renew it, is the most fashionable idea in global business since the craze for emerging markets over a decade ago.</p><p>Yet there is a puzzle at the heart of the orthodoxy. Few bosses, in public or in private, expect their own firms to decline, and hardly any American companies are valued by investors as if their profits will fall. The tech revolution, it seems, will be momentous, but harmless, with no corporate victims. Something does not add up.</p><p>If disruption is defined as conventional firms being clobbered by digital ones, there is certainly some of it about. This month Toys \"R\" Us went bankrupt, joining many clothing and hardware retailers felled by e-commerce. On August 23rd shares in WPP, an advertising firm, slumped after it said clients were cutting spending partly because of technological change. A few days later Amazon closed its acquisition of Whole Foods, a food retailer, and cut its high prices, spreading fear in the supermarket industry's aisles.</p><p>At least six conventional industries have been eviscerated by digital innovation in the past two decades\u2014music, video-renting, books, taxis, newspapers and clothes retailing. In financial terms the survivors are shadows of their former selves. The New York Times Company's profits are 67% below their peak. It is a similar story at Barnes &amp; Noble (76%) and Universal Music (about 40%).</p><p>But these firms and their peers were never large. In 1997, when Mark Zuckerberg was 13 years old and the six industries were in their prime, they accounted for 2% of the profits of the S&amp;P 500 index of big American firms. The toll that digital disruption has taken so far on overall earnings is thus tiny. Across America's economy profits are high and stable relative to GDP.</p><p>If technological disruption was about to inflict a new and more devastating blow on traditional firms, you would expect to see lots of them with miserly valuations, as investors discounted a slump in their profits. Yet such firms are uncommon. Only about 40 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have a price-earnings ratio of less than 12, which is a sign of imminent decline. That is similar to the share two decades ago and half the number of ten years ago.</p><p>Only two industries are priced for devastation. General Motors and Ford are valued at just seven times profits. Investors expect Tesla, a manufacturer of electric cars, to steal market share, and ride-sharing firms to cut demand for cars. Airlines are dirt cheap but that is because the market frets about a price war and the chance of tighter antitrust regulation, not about disruption.</p><p>Many industries that you might imagine to be directly in the crosshairs of Silicon Valley are expected to plod along happily. Consider television, where Amazon, Netflix, YouTube and Apple are pouring money into buying and making new shows. There are certainly worries about consumers cutting the cable-TV cord, but the incumbent cable firms and content producers are in aggregate valued on 20 times profits, implying cash flows will continue to rise. Likewise, hotel companies, rather than being wiped out by Airbnb and throttled by online travel agents, enjoy similar perky valuations to those they had ten years ago.</p><p>The list goes on. The credit-card giants, Visa and MasterCard, are on a roll, and are together worth almost as much as Amazon: there is little sign of disruption by digital-payments firms. From stodgy banks (facing a putative threat from fintech) to electric utilities (which might be disrupted by batteries and smart grids) it is a similar story: valuations imply that investors are relaxed. Even food retail's giant sitting duck, Walmart, is forecast to see pre-tax profits increase by a cumulative 6% over the next three years. </p><p>Investors appear to be assuming an accommodation between big tech and the rest of big business, not a bloody showdown. The five largest tech firms (Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft) have valuations that suggest their combined share of total corporate profits will rise from 7% now to 13% in a decade. They are expected to keep near-monopolies for decades in products that attract huge public interest, such as search and social media. But they are not expected to lay waste to America Inc.</p><p>That is reasonable. Many incumbent industries have high barriers to entry. Two of the largest, banking and health care, are surrounded by a mesh of regulation. And existing big firms have raised their game. Most giants, from Walmart to General Electric, have digital or e-commerce divisions. America's incumbents spend five times more on research and development than the five big technology companies do.</p><p>But it is possible that the present balancing act may topple over. Either tech breakthroughs or deregulation could make it easier for tech firms to compete against conventional ones. If the tech boom becomes a bubble, there will be pressure on tech bosses to lower the hurdle rates they use for new projects and invest much more heavily in old industries. If they are rational, they will resist the temptation, but when you are holed up in a hotel room surrounded by admirers it can be easy to lose perspective.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-P96OVHJ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PKD-G3S1-JBKN-B383-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Like so many visitors to New York, she spent most of her time sightseeing, and an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBa9vkerJbG/?igshid=cfzm5zn8ff9p\">Instagram</url> from her trip shows her mugging with a dinosaur at the American Museum of Natural History. For the first time, she used       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/t/airbnb/\">Airbnb</url> for lodging. A few weeks later, she tried to login to her account, only for Airbnb to inform her that she had been banned because her account \"didn't follow our Terms of Service and community standards,\" according to screengrabs she provided to\u00a0Rolling Stone.\u00a0She says she followed up with customer service twice, but to no avail.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For months, Flour was baffled. She knew it was not uncommon for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-sex-work-big-tech/\">big tech platforms to discriminate against sex workers</url>. But she hadn't used her business name or email address in registering her account; she had used her legal name and her personal email. (Most sex workers do not use their legal names publicly, for safety reasons and due to the stigma associated with the profession.) More to the point, she hadn't been traveling on business, and didn't shoot any adult content at the host home. She had absolutely no idea how Airbnb would have ever figured out that she did       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/t/sex-work/\">sex work</url> in the first place.</p><p>\"I spent the last few years mulling it over in my mind. Trying to figure out how they knew. I thought maybe the owner of the place?,\" she tells <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rolling Stone.</emphasis> \"But never thought data mining was the answer. It's weird to think they are going so out of their way to remove accounts and block people in my industry from using their service.\"</p><p>A report from last week suggests Airbnb may be doing just this. The Evening Standard <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/airbnb-software-scan-online-life-suitable-guest-a4325551.html\">reported</url> that Airbnb owns a patent for AI software that could screen users based on \"ISPs, Public and Commercial Databases, Social Networks, Blogs\" and \"Other\" personal data in the cloud. The software was patented by a background checking startup called Trooly, which was acquired by Airbnb in 2017. The software would use such information to assess \"traits such as 'neuroticism and involvement in crimes' and 'narcissism, Machiavellianism, or psychopathy',\" which would mark a potential Airbnb user as potentially \"untrustworthy.\" Some of these metrics of untrustworthiness, such as affiliation with hate websites or being \"a known fraudster or scammer,\" make sense. Others appear to be more subjective. Personality traits linked to lower scores include such abstract traits as \"badness\" and \"neuroticism\"; behavior traits linked to lower scores include \"involvement with drugs or alcohol,\" or \"authoring online content with negative language\" (a description that basically would apply to every blogger ever).\u00a0</p><p>As<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.xbiz.com/news/249406/airbnb-admits-ownership-of-ai-technology-that-targets-sex-workers-others\">Xbiz later</url> reported, the patent's software would score users poorly if they were associated with \"sex work\" or had been \"involved in pornography,\" and Flour is not the only adult performer who claims to have been targeted by Airbnb. Last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/airbnbs-war-on-porn-stars-they-locked-me-out\">adult performer Sara Jay told the</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Daily Beast</emphasis>that she too had her account terminated without warning or explanation; when she asked why, Airbnb's legal team said that it had found evidence she had \"advertised sexual services,\" such as a link to her website and an escort site operating out of Panama. (The escort site, Jay said, had used her photo without consent.) While the story didn't explain how, exactly, the website had discovered Jay was a sex worker to begin with, something like software that sweeps your digital footprint for arbitrary \"untrustworthiness\" characteristics potentially could.\u00a0</p><p>In a statement to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rolling Stone,</emphasis> Airbnb denied \"us[ing] the methods listed in the patent as suggested\" in the\u00a0Evening Standard\u00a0story. \"As with any other company, there are a number of patents we file, ranging from searching listings to automating booking availability, and it does not mean we necessarily implement all or part of what's in them,\" the spokesperson says. But this is not the same as saying that Airbnb does not use methods similar to those listed in the patent, or that they do not use the methods listed in the patent at all. When asked about why Flour was banned from the platform specifically, the Airbnb spokesperson said that she was \"removed over a year before Airbnb acquired Trooly, and therefore the patent,\" though a Skift <url normalizedValue=\"https://skift.com/2017/06/16/airbnb-buys-background-check-startup-trooly-to-combat-scams/\">piece</url> announcing the acquisition says that Trooly had been \"helping Airbnb authenticate user identities since 2015.\"</p><p>In terms of the specific screening methods it does use, the spokesperson said that Airbnb \"screens all hosts and guests globally against regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watch lists\" and runs \"background checks for certain felony convictions, sex offender registrations, or significant misdemeanors.\" Such a thorough vetting process is obviously necessary in light of Airbnb's history of fielding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/airbnb-guest-sexual-assault-allegation\">sexual assault claims</url> and a recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/orinda-shooting-fifth-person-dead-halloween-party-shooting-airbnb-rental-2019-11-02/\">fatal shooting at a party house.</url>But they don't account for why women like Flour would be banned from the service simply on the basis of their professions, or potential future algorithms that may or may not use external factors such as social media profiles to deem a user's worthiness.\u00a0</p><p>Flour never heard from Airbnb why she was banned in the first place, and since it's been almost four years since she was kicked off the platform, she doesn't expect to. But the kicker, for her, wasn't getting banned for no reason. It was receiving an email from Airbnb, just a few months after, asking users to sign a Community commitment \"to fight bias.\"</p><p>\"They wouldn't reply to my support emails,\" she says. \"But they sent me spam about how their platform was anti-discrimination.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RLNGST-935048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RLNGST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXV-MBG1-JC3V-6505-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468655</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Rolling Stone</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1921\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Also, under such liability provisions, if platforms want to aggregate news from publishers, they would be obliged to pay a fee, share agreed data, and allow readers to easily get to the publisher's site.</p><p>News in the era of big tech</p><p>A Star series is examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_96_14022019018006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T504-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1 are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_95_14022019016001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T4G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_76_14022019014001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T52W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1 are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_103_14022019026001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T427-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_93_14022019016006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T55T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_97_14022019016001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T4VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it's not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here's the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world's largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google's and Facebook's aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India's major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebookstyle violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google's and Facebook's business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google's and Facebook's model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn't necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet's giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook's Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies' impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let's put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won't hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_118_14022019018006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-6381-JB3N-T4KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A typical response goes like this \u2013 what is the big deal if I read a TOI news story or commentary via Google search, I am still reading TOI content.</p><p>It is a big deal because when Google is aggregating content through its news service, it is taking the cream of digital advertising, but it\u2019s not paying a dime to create that content.</p><p/><p>Illustration: Anirban Bora</p><p>Now think about this: if this keeps happening indefinitely, news media companies that invest in talent and technology to produce content will be essentially spending money so that Google and Facebook can make money.</p><p>That is absurd and, if you value a free media, dangerous. Here\u2019s the thing, though \u2013 this dangerous absurdity goes on everywhere and most governments in democracies seem loath to do anything about it.</p><p>This is especially true in India, the world\u2019s largest democracy with a vast potential for rapid growth in readership and viewership of news.</p><p>India, as we all know, is exhilaratingly and intimidatingly complex. Understanding India, as credible Indian media outlets try to do, does not come cheap.</p><p>But in the near future, how viable will the economics of news production be if readers and viewers consume news mainly via Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s aggregations and algorithms and the two Silicon Valley companies make tons more money at the cost of those who are actually creating the content?</p><p>But none of India\u2019s major political parties seems too bothered by this.</p><p>Democratic politics without a financially viable, independent local media is almost a contradiction in terms. Our politicians, however, seem to get upset with global internet companies and social media platforms only on issues relating to fake news and election campaigns.</p><p>For sure, fake news and Facebook-style violations of data privacy during election campaigns are big issues. But the issue of how to keep producers of real, verified, credible news from getting swamped by Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s business practices is arguably an even bigger issue.</p><p>Think about this: If independent journalism keeps becoming financially unviable, fake news merchants and data manipulators will have a free run.</p><p>India, therefore, needs to seriously consider policy responses to Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s model of distributing news. Some proposals are floating around, including those made in the Cairncross Review.</p><p>A European Union proposal will empower publishers with the right to ask for more money from web platforms. The British report talks of setting up a powerful regulator to oversee commercial relationships between internet behemoths and news publishers. France has actually imposed a levy on big tech companies from this year.</p><p>India needn\u2019t necessarily take these or other solutions on board. We can think of our own solutions.</p><p>But, first, we need to start thinking. And when we do that, our policy makers should know they have to be ready for fierce responses from internet\u2019s giants. Google has threatened to withdraw its news service from EU if the latter imposes the rule that publishers have the right to ask for more money.</p><p>The good thing is that there are two recent examples of Indian policy makers smartly regulating aspects of internet business.</p><p>First, India repulsed the attack on net neutrality rejecting, among other arguments, Facebook\u2019s Free Basics campaign. Second, a commission established to propose data localisation delivered a report on the basis of which a new law is being drafted.</p><p>There is also, however, a recent example of how not to regulate internet business. The changes in e-commerce rules that took effect from February 1 are perfect examples of bad policy making.</p><p>Those rules were abrupt, they micromanaged business decisions best left to businesses, and they raised a very profound question as to why exactly the government was in a hurry to do this when so many other, more important regulatory issues are being postponed because elections are on us.</p><p>India must review Silicon Valley companies\u2019 impact on the news business, and it must do it right. Let\u2019s put it this way \u2013 our politicians should remember Google won\u2019t hire reporters to cover their campaign speeches.</p><p>So, some sincere concern for those who actually hire reporters is entirely in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF0-ST31-JB3N-T3TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"812\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Today, copyright and news aggregation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Musicians and video producers have copyright over their work, but in many countries, news publications are not afforded the same protections for their articles. That's allowed websites that aggregate original reporting from other publications to pop up. These websites often trick readers because they are sometimes designed to dupe the public into believing they are run by the credible publications they aggregate reporting from. These misleading websites don't pay for the news they repurpose, but they often find ways to monetize that content and don't share their profits.</p><p>Google News, Apple News, Amazon Echo, or Facebook news feeds exacerbate the situation because some are set up so that when readers click on articles, they are kept within the platform's site. \"Google News does take readers to the publisher's network, but bypasses the showcase, money-making home page, which undercuts brand presence,\" the International News Media Association (INMA) report says. \"Taking the reader off the publisher's network entirely by Apple and Facebook also denies the media company the usage data.\" It also causes \"brand flattening\" - minimizing the connection and value between a story and the publication that produced it.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Platforms pay for use of text intellectual property.</p><p>\"We need a system whereby the platforms that benefit so much from the engagement driven by news return value to the people who create that content,\" said David Chavern, a chief executive at the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing approximately 2,000 newspapers in the United States and Canada, in the INMA report. \"This isn't to say that all news is equally valuable - and we aren't anticipating a collective effort to set prices for specific content - but the platforms' unique unwillingness to pay news publishers has to end.\"</p><p>To protect the intellectual property of publications, INMA believes digital platforms should pay to use text-based news stories - a change that will require new legislation.</p><p>The European Union has already supported such a measure through a publishers' right directive, which was recently passed by all of its member states. The directive does not cover links shared on social platforms, but includes summaries or substantial passages of stories.</p><p>INMA also suggested tech giants should adopt content licensing deals like the one Facebook has recently offered large U.S. publishers in exchange for permission to use headlines and previews of stories on their platform. INMA looks somewhat favourably at the subscription revenue share model championed by Apple News+, where consumers pay $12.99 a month for access to content from hundreds of publications. Publishers split about half the money Apple makes from subscribers based on how much of their content is consumed.</p><p>Platforms pay for use of audio intellectual property.</p><p>Unlike news articles, from which publishers can earn ad dollars, it is much more difficult to monetize audio news clips, especially because, says INMA, publishers have already been asked to provide snippets of their content to digital platforms - for free.</p><p>The rise of smart home speakers like Google Home and Amazon's Echo and Alexa have led INMA to feel copyright protections are needed for text news that is read aloud. It points to music industry \"carriage fees\" - payments to artists based on how much of and the number of times a piece is played - as a potential solution. INMA says regulators would need to approve such fees before they could be enacted.</p><p>Remove platform ecosystem trap on news.</p><p>Most digital platforms that aggregate news create a \"trap,\" which keeps readers from being sent to a publisher's site when they click on a story. Apple News, for example, touts that it provides news readers can trust \"all in one place,\" but INMA says, \"that place is Apple and it's hard to escape or monetize even if you log in as a subscriber to that news brand when prompted.\"</p><p>The platforms that readers are kept within often minimize a publication's branding by shrinking logos and sometimes removing a publisher's design schemes.</p><p>INMA prefers the Google News model, which avoids an \"ecosystem trap\" by taking a reader directly to a publisher's site and allowing them to view ads and next article recommendations from the news organization.</p><p>Platforms accept liability for distributing content.</p><p>Digital platforms provide a variety of services that sometimes mirror offerings from publishers or telecommunications companies, but neither a publisher nor a telecommunications title fully encompasses what these platforms do.</p><p>INMA believes the platforms should be given their own classification as a \"network distributor of content\" and create a secondary legal liability for distribution of content.</p><p>The liability would cover fabricated news and defamatory material - whether generated by the platform, users or advertisers - and would prevent publishers from being undermined.</p><p>Also, under such liability provisions, if platforms want to aggregate news from publishers, they would be obliged to pay a fee, share agreed data, and allow readers to easily get to the publisher's site.</p><p>A Star series is examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry. Stories include:</p><p>Overview: Media and big tech face off in digital age</p><p>Copyright and news aggregation</p><p>Thursday: Privacy and consumer data</p><p>Tax status</p><p>Fake news and fake ads</p><p>Quality subscription content</p><p>Platform news tax</p><p>Ad technology dominance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019101656009340</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-TV71-JBTY-W18K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

How does the saying go?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RAHM EMMANUEL: You never want a serious crisis go to waste.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALICE BRENNAN: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It sounds especially gharish in the crisis we're currently facing... all over the world, many of us are dealing with loss and chaos ... our entire ways of life turned completely upside down ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the truth is, some people look at tall of this ... and see dollar signs ... that it's fertile ground to make money</p><p>There are a lot of people out there right now either already winning from this pandemic, or calculating how to win from it in the future.</p><p>Some are legit -- I mean who hasn't subscribed to an extra streaming service or online fitness app in the last month?</p><p>But some are less legit -- the nefarious winners.</p><p>So this week on the show -- we wanted to find out exactly who these winners are Who is winning from this crisis and how?</p><p>To start off with we sent our reporter Geoff Thompson to find some scammers he begins our story... at a stakeout outside a Perth post office.</p><p>ADRIAN FRANCIS: Hi Geoff GEOFF THOMPSON: yeah G'day Adrian can you hear me alright? ADRIAN FRANCIS: (tap tap) Ah yeah. Just bear with me for a second while I just make sure I'm actually doing a job at the moment. A surveillance job at the moment, so I'm in the car. My apologies. GEOFF THOMPSON: Ah Gotcha, that's alright. It is actually it's about some face masks.(Laughs)</p><p>Private investigator Adrian Francis is sitting in his car staking out a Perth Post Office - he's on the hunt for scammers</p><p>ADRIAN FRANCIS: Basically, it's a report that we've got through the website where somebody is allegedly misrepresenting the quality of some masks that have come in from overseas. As you can imagine, there's a lot of masks from India, China. A lot of I suppose mainly Asian countries are, poorly manufacturing masks and then submitting them as N-95 masks. So we're just having a quick look to see the supposed to be arriving at a post office box within the next couple of hours. So we're just gonna try and see who's picking them up.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: Adrian's a former policeman from NSW but now he spends most of his time investigating counterfeit products.</p><p>He suspects the mask delivery he's staking out will be dodgy ones from overseas.</p><p>ADRIAN FRANCIS: They're bulk amounts, they're quite cheap. But obviously they're putting up the price by 3, 400 per cent. You know, we're hearing that some of these, whether it be hand sanitizer or masks, are being, manufactured and distributed by organised crime groups.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: People have been leaving anonymous tip-offs on Adrian's website about Coronavirus scams like backyard brewed hand sanitiser that's labelled and sold as the real deal big company stuff. Along with masks health workers so desperately need.</p><p>ADRIAN FRANCIS: you've got to ask yourself. If there's such a short supply of them, why is there such a high supply of them on the Internet?I shouldn't laugh about this, but we had a funny incident the other day where someone sent us a photograph of a mask they purchase, which they said that was quite thin. And they'd sneezed in the mask and it had blown the front of the mask out. So the mask was just hanging down.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: In the end, no-one ever came to pick up the bulk face mask order at the Perth post office but Adrian has no shortage of other scam tips to chase down.</p><p>Coronavirus is keeping the scam-busters of the world busy too.</p><p>KITBOGA: Do you have any of that available - the the cure?</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: Coronavirus scams are going viral...</p><p>SELLER: Yes, sir. Actually, sir, this immunity blend. The main focus for this one is to protect against environmental threat uh...it's very effective to fight against coronavirus because of it contains 100 percent pure essential oils and it also supports healthy immune function KITBOGA: Just to be sure, I want a cure. It's been tested and this works or,... SELLER: YesKITBOGA: ok.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: That old man's voice belongs to a young American who calls himself Kitboga.</p><p>KITBOGA: Most people just call me Kit and I have a livestream, a YouTube channel</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: The former software engineer now makes a living scamming the scammers.</p><p>He's been doing it for about three years ... it's part public service, but mostly Kit's on a mission to publicly shame the unsuspecting staffers manning the scammer's call centres.</p><p>KITBOGA: My goal is to raise awareness about what the scammers are doing, as well as provide some entertainment in the whole area of it. So I play different characters and I try to put the scammers through pretty ridiculous situations</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: In his videos he usually dresses up to mask his true identity - he sits in front of a green screen wearing wigs and big aviator sunglasses over which his trademark cynical eyebrow arches</p><p>KITBOGA: In my car I had these old aviator glasses and I just put them on. And I think that just became the thing.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: ...and he alters his voice to lure the scammers in to taking his bait.</p><p>KITBOGA: I can pitch my voice higher. Do it like a call that's like a valley girl voice, which this is how you have to talk without it. It's kind of weird, but if you pitch shift your voice a little bit higher then it sounds. You know, like I'm maybe a young girl. Or this is like an older woman, maybe with a really, really bad cell phone connection. So if I feel like I need to ... you know if I want to play like Russian Voice or something like that, I can make it sound like I have a really bad phone connection.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: The pandemic has given Kit even more material to work with.</p><p>And he live streams everything to thousands of fans.</p><p>KITBOGA: there's thousands and thousands of domain names being registered related to the Coronavirus. And I've randomly pulled some of them up. And you can actually see that they're developing scams and different things around it.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: As I watch Kitboga do his thing - it's alarming to me that there seems to be no end to what Coronavirus snake oil sellers are prepared to promise anything for a buck.</p><p>KITBOGA: Is it true that if you put it underneath your toenails, it absorbs into your bloodstream faster? SELLER: Yes, you are correct. KITBOGA: Good, good, good. Could you do me a favour? Can you list up the ingredients one more time? It was cinnamon...SELLER:, cinnamon, glow, biid, lemon, lime, eucalyptus, rosemary, peppermint, spearmint and oregano, essential oils. KITBOGA: You know, I think I gave all that in my kitchen right now. I'll probably just go up and kind of. I don't know, maybe I can blend it all up and make a soup out of it.SELLER: Uhm upon checking. Thank you, sir. Your. We have a problem with your address because it's not found in the USPS. KITBOGA: It doesn't exist. Just like your cure. You're lying son of a gun.SELLER: Right. So I think. Oh, dear, no, we're good. Now, are you kidding me? KITBOGA: It's not. Yes. I just want to show to people who are desperate. You're a liar and a thief. You should be locked up.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: Back in Australia we've got our own breed of online scam hunters.</p><p>ALEX: It's 13 past 10 and I've just finished a teleconference with the rest of the scams team.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: As Alex begins another busy day working remotely from his Canberra home ... he's trying to keep up with the surge in COVID19 scams targeting Aussies.</p><p>ALEX: So looking at these now, we've got a page for toilet paper sales with no delivery on a social media platform, with accompanying reviews, masks on delivery and masks non-delivery.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: A law grad with a masters in IT, Alex is a senior member of the ACCC's ScamWatch team.</p><p>ALEX: There's four phone numbers from phishing attacks which we'll pass to telcos to have a look at. And the second Covid 19 psychic healing scam that we've seen</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: Alex clocked a big one on Tuesday morning this week at --</p><p>ALEX: ...10:40. We've just discovered 16 reports that all talk about receiving an SMS that says you were due to receive an ATO refund of one thousand seven hundred eighty six dollars and fifty one cents. Visit h._d._t._v Vasconcelos slash ATO dot gov dot au dot tax manager dot info forward slash claim and the site looks identical to my GOV. It is a really, really good phish. So I am deeply concerned. I'm going to stop this now and notify the Cyber Security Centre and see if we can't take down the site and get some warnings in place as quickly as we can.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: Right now, the scams have stepped up.</p><p>Alex and the team are working around the clock to protect us from scammers capitalising on Coronavirus confusion</p><p>DELIA RICKARD: We have seen them going from a trickle in January, February to getting over 50 a day. So so far we've had six hundred eighty six reports, but the numbers are going up every day.</p><p>GEOFF THOMPSON: Alex's boss Delia Rickard is the deputy chair of the ACCC.</p><p>Since the start of the year, the ACCC had received more than 1100 reports of online scams relating to Coronavirus ... estimated to have cost Australian scam victims a total of nearly 150,000 dollars.</p><p>DELIA RICKARD: You've got people at home, they don't necessarily have the same IT protection on their home devices as the ones that work. Suddenly, people have never online shopped in their life or online shopping. People may be worried about others who are worse positions than themselves wanting to donate to them. And people are desperate for information. So when they see something that looks to them like it might help them find about how they can get tested or what's happening, and they click on links without thinking about it. So it is absolutely fertile ground for scammers, unfortunately.</p><p>ALICE BRENNAN: Federal authorities are continuing to investigate the ever-increasing number of scammers looking to make a quick buck out of corona fears.</p><p>But there's another type of scam investigator... who's looking to filter out swindlers on the stock market...and they're aiming to make a profit while they do it.</p><p>Another one of our reporters Mario Christodoulou takes up the story... in Sydney's eastern suburbs.</p><p>JOHN HEMPTON: We spend most of our time chasing fraudsters, our job on the short side is to find every such scumbag in financial markets in the world and short a tiny bit of every one of their companies.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: That's John Hempton. He's the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Bronte Capital, a Bondi-based investment fund.</p><p>And he describes his business model like this.</p><p>JOHN HEMPTON: We turn shit into gold. We find the shittiest companies in the world bid against them and when those bets pay off, we try to buy the best in the world.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: It's safe to say that right now... the financial world, like the real world, is suffering... a lot.</p><p>REPORTER: a record shattering 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week,</p><p>REPORTER: the Australian sharemarket plunging more than 7 per cent in early trade</p><p>REPORTER: the chancellor has announced a multi-billion pound support package to help businesses through the corona virus crisis.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: If you're an investor and you have enough money and enough experience -- now is a good time to make bank.</p><p>John, for example, is a short seller.</p><p>A short seller is someone who sells a stock on the open market expecting or betting that it's probably going to drop in value, at which stage they can buy it back at a lower price.</p><p>Sell high, buy low.... Make money off the difference.</p><p>But short selling is risky... John makes most of his money the traditional way - investing in companies that will increase in value and, hopefully, make lots of money.</p><p>But when he is in short-selling mode, he's not looking for companies that are going to increase in value - he's looking for companies he expects to fail. He calls them scumbag companies - fraudsters, shysters and people who cook the books.</p><p>JOHN HEMPTON: We have computers to track bad people and we have more than 200 shorts on at any time. Wherever they are, anywhere in the world, as long as they're in the stock market and they're involved in things that you can bet against.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: Unsurprisingly, scumbag companies, to use John's words, tend to be overvalued. So he bets against them, hoping to make money when they collapse.</p><p>JOHN HEMPTON: when the market is falling hard like it's been falling lately, that diversified short book tends to fall even harder. And so we tend to make money on those shorts.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: Short sellers are sometimes described as professional sceptics. And it's this instinct that drove John to interrogate the early nonchalant response to the virus.Back in February - three weeks before Coronavirus was declared a pandemic - he started to read medical journals</p><p>JOHN HEMPTON: That's actually one of the most frustrating periods in my life, because I was reading this stuff and thinking, oh, my God, this could be horrible. And I was modelling out just how horrible. But at the same time, you know, you had Donald Trump, for instance, just flat out dismissing it as an issue in the United States. And Scott Morrison, if he said anything, was saying highly reassuring statements. Right up to and including he's quite late statement saying that was okay going to the Football. Now, just as all politicians didn't see what was going on in the medical journals, the market didn't see. It was very strange you had reputable scientists in reputable journals saying, look, there's a reasonable chance of complete utter global catastrophe here.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: Among investors, there's a race to predict the course of the virus. Because if you can predict when the virus will peak, you can also predict when the market will start recovering. And if you know that..well...that's pretty valuable information.</p><p>But how do you do that? Well, I'd like to introduce you to this guy.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: Christopher Joye, I'm chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Coolabah Capital</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: Christopher Joye is a busy man.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: Let's just get through it Mario, let's start right at the top. MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: His job is to protect and increase other people's wealth - a lot of it. He says Coolabah Capital manages about 4 to 5 billion dollars...</p><p>Christopher takes me through a series of slides and pauses at one in particular - a graph, showing a bold red line moving up and down like a Swiss mountain range. But this graph isn't infection rates or mortality data, this graph shows traffic congestion.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: We monitor traffic congestion in Chinese cities or pretty much all global cities.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: So what does traffic congestion have to do with a pandemic? Well, it's giving Christopher Joye an insight into how quickly China is recovering from the CoronaVirus.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: So if we just switch the screen to Beijing traffic, our hypothesis is they're telecommuting a little bit more so it hasn't quite recovered the 2019 levels. It's a little bit below 2019 levels. Now, why is this important? Because we want to know when China's factories or so-called supply chains come back on line.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: Every morning he wakes up and looks at information sources spread across three continents, trying to find that key data point which will give him an edge.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: I woke up at about 3:30 a.m. I'm checking not just in the movement in the U.S. equity market, in the US bond market, but also now I'm looking at infection rates around the world, the evolution of those infection rates, are they starting to decelerate? I'm looking at fatality rates. I'm looking at traffic congestion. I'm looking at restaurant bookings. I'm looking at public transport usage. Everything and anything, electricity consumption. Different forms of satellite image that give us a sense of pollution levels around the world to see whether industrial centres are truly back online</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: He's trying to figure out when the virus will peak, and, after it peaks. What happens next...will markets return to normal?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: We want to anticipate the future, we want to try and divine the financial market destiny and we want to understand the true nature of the virus as well as we possibly can.</p><p>MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: Christopher's trying to figure out whether Australia will bounce back from COVID 19 -- Will things ultimately return to some sort of new normal? What companies will disappear? Who will lose their jobs? What industries will be the first to come back online? And which will never return at all?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JOYE: The key question, though, for investors is, is this a temporary shock or is this likely to be a permanent shock? Our view is it is going to be temporary. If what I'm saying is right. If it's a temporary shock, if financial markets have potentially reacted in an exaggerated fashion to this shock, then there is every possibility that financial markets will also eventually normalise and that we can pick up cheap assets right now and make money out of those assets.</p><p>ALICE BRENNAN: There are companies already showing signs of recovery.</p><p>... and some haven't just recovered ... they're growing.</p><p>Many of them are technology stocks: Apple, Netflix, Amazon - they're capitalising on the suddenly burgeoning stay-at-home economy.</p><p>There's one such company that's experienced spectacular growth - you may have heard of it -- though it was once a little known video-conferencing program.</p><p>ACTOR: Bringing your together your team on Zoom feels just like you're all in the same room Zoom is now the most popular product on Apple's App Store.</p><p>And with that I'm handing over to my colleague -- fellow reporter Meghna Bali -- and as she discovered, it's hit the big time... in spite of a succession of PR disasters.MEGHNA BALI: So while stay at home orders have declared workplace banter and casual corridor brainstorming a thing of the past... there's one form of communication that's certainly on the up at the moment...The ole zoom conference...ALICE BRENNAN: I think everyone's here now because Geoff just joined us. Hello, Geoff. GEOFF THOMPSON: Hello. MARIO CHRISTODOULOU: And like just about everyone else ... we've stumbled into this new way of working...KAT GREGORY: Our wifi has been down for 24 hours.GINA MCKEON: While Alice is setting up, we'll do a quick whip around about how everyone's doing and feeling with their stories before the script reviewMEGHNA BALI: In the last two months Zoom's user numbers have ballooned in a way even their CEO couldn't have imagined. From 10 million to 200 million. The great thing with Zoom, it's it's so easy to use. And you've got a hundred people that can go on at the same time. And, you know, that's why we're on it every day. The company's share price has soared too... from 68 point 72 US dollars at the start of January ... to a record-high of almost 160 US dollars a share at the end of March. Zoom is undoubtedly a big winner in the corona crisis ... But this unexpected growth has exposed some serious issues with the app. We should probably consider, you know, whether we should communicate over Zoom as well. ALICE BRENNAN: how do you communicate with sources who don't want to talk over Zoom?MEGHNA BALI: Well, I mean, if my contacts for this story are anything to go by, I mean, everyone has preferred stuff like WhatsApp.</p><p>PATRICK WARDLE: HelloMEGHNA BALI: Hi, Patrick. How are you? PATRICK WARDLE: Good. I just got back from surfing, so I'm stokedMEGHNA BALI: Patrick Wardle lives by the beach in Hawaii... in between surf sessions, he works as the principal security researcher at a software company called Jamf, and he's a former NSA hacker. He's worried about the world's new reliance on Zoom. And, yeah ... we spoke via Whatsapp PATRICK WARDLE: Zoom has been designed first and foremost to be incredibly user friendly and also Zoom's priority you know, kind of as a Start-Up. Silicon Valley Start-Up is to grow its user base so it can expand as a company and IPO and make a lot of money. And that's well and good. But the problem is that pretty much flies completely in the face of security. Security is not something that makes you money.MEGHNA BALI: ...hackers have been taking advantage... PATRICK WARDLE: So hackers are the spy agencies now in a way had an easier time because they can target these people at home. Anytime there is a disaster or a situation where there's kind of fear, a lot of unknowns, hackers and malware authors, unfortunately, really jump on that as an opportunity, because amongst all the chaos from their point of view, it's really an incredible opportunity to often exploit people. MEGHNA BALI: So what kind of hacking are we talking about here? Well, the boom of Zoom has illuminated it's various security flaws.And those flaws have made way for some hilarious hijacking -- or zoom-bombing -- as it's called. HAMISH BLAKE: Zoom for one more!MEGHNA BALI: Like Australian comedian Hamish Blake... who's been dropping in on virtual workspacesSTUDENT: Can anyone else see Hamish Blake? HAMISH BLAKE: Hey guys how's it going? STUDENT: Are you going to take over our lectures?HAMISH BLAKE: Can't do the lectures sorry just zipping around, picking up tutes. MEGHNA BALI: But as Patrick tells me, zoom bombing is just one of the app's serious issues...PATRICK WARDLE: Last year we had an issue where a malicious Web site could actually remotely turn on a user's webcam if they had Zoom installed and kind of spy on them. MEGHNA BALI: There have also been more sinister instances... where hackers infiltrate calls and often shout racist slurs and threats. TEACHER: Who is saying that?MEGHNA BALI: It's now also emerged that thousands of Zoom videos are available online for anyone to see... including sensitive therapy sessions... WEBINAR: And together... we'll just begin by taking a deep cleansing breath .MEGHNA BALI: ...business meetings and nudity from an online Brazillian waxing class. These videos were uploaded by other Zoom users -- anyone was able to access them because recordings all have the same default file name... so it was easy to find them. And last month The Intercept exposed that Zoom video calls were not end-to-end encrypted, despite the company's claims that they were.Then Vice reported the company had accidentally leaked thousands of user's email addresses and photos.. because of an issue with how the app handles contacts.And on TOP of that -- we now know that Zoom was also sending user data to Facebook -- info like when the user opened the app, their device model, the time zone and city they're connecting from and a unique advertiser identifier... which helps companies send targeted ads. PATRICK WARDLE: Zoom said, hey, this was a mistake. We're sorry. And to their credit, fixed this. But the fact that that code was in this product that is being installed by millions of users around the world, again, kind of illustrates that, you know, Zoom's approach to security, and privacy is lacking. MEGHNA BALI: Zoom C-E-O Eric Yuan publicly apologised for the myriad of flaws in a blog post on the site two weeks ago.ACTOR: We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home. However, we recognize that we have fallen short of the community's - and our own - privacy and security expectations. For that, I am deeply sorry.MEGHNA BALI: In the same post, Yuan outlined seven steps the company will take to protect its users... including diverting resources to tackle the safety issues.Two days after that apology... The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab published a damning report about Zoom's security. It found that Zoom was sometimes routing traffic, including videos and encryption keys, through servers in China... which means that technically the company was legally obligated to give those keys up if China requested them. So up went another blog post from the Zoom CEO.ACTOR: In our urgency to come to the aid of people around the world during this unprecedented pandemic, we added server capacity and deployed it quickly - starting in China, where the outbreak began. In that process, we failed to fully implement our usual geo-fencing best practices. We have since corrected this... We have also been working on improving our encryption and will be working with experts to ensure we are following best practices.MEGHNA BALI: And then there was ... another announcement ...This week, Eric Yuan posted that users will actually be able to opt in and out of the regions they want their data to go through ... but you can't opt out of the region you're based in, and the feature is only available to PAYING customers. And the CEO noted that \"data of free users outside of China will never be routed through China.So given the risks, should we still be using Zoom...The most sensitive Australian government agencies are thinking twice about it... I checked with all our Federal departments.6 out of 14 told me that staff could use Zoom in exceptional circumstances... that's for unclassified meetings with external stakeholders and members of the public. Here's what the other departments had to say: Finance, Health and the Attorney General have blocked installation of the app on their networks... Defence told BB they've issued general advice about safe use of tech -- but wouldn't confirm to us if they've banned Zoom.Veterans Affairs wouldn't specify if staff used the app or not either. The Department of Home Affairs told me it didn't rely on Zoom for internal communication. The Department of Social Services said it didn't use it... and the Department of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to my questions. Rachael Falk, CEO of The Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre says Australian agencies need to be more vigilant. RACHAEL FALK: Anything that requires probably sensitive information they exchanged probably unwise for any government agency or public officials to be using it because it's not inherently secure. MEGHNA BALI: She says in some way... Zoom has been a victim of its own success. RACHAEL FALK: I kind of have some sympathy for the Zoom people because good on them. You know, they've got massive- their customer numbers must be through the roof. But at the same time,You really need to be accurate with your security advice and the information you give your customer base, because if you don't, they will leave you and they'll crucify you because you have to be really clear about what you will deliver and won't deliver. MEGHNA BALI: The issues have led rivals to capitalise on Zoom's misfortunes... and spruik their own video-conferencing products. Microsoft Teams clocked 44 million users in mid-March... jumping 12 million users in a week... While daily usage of Google Meet is 25 times higher now than it was in January. It's not hard to imagine that video conferencing software will become a more prominent technology in a post-corona world.Social isolation means many of us are relying on technology in some way to work and socialise ... but potentially also fight the virus And as my colleague Kat Gregory reports ... that fight may come at a cost to our privacy.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Imagine for a second that just by using your mobile phone, you could track who has Covid 19? And you could figure out if you've been in contact with them? Would you do it? I reckon your answer could be different to a few months ago.After all this sort of technology - known as digital contact tracing - could save a lot of lives right?That's a HUGE benefit to all of us. PATRICK FAIR: I think the idea of using technology to contact trace is a bit of a no brainer, could save a great deal of time and economic impact if done properly.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: That's Patrick Fair - an IT lawyer and academic at Deakin University.</p><p>He and other IT privacy experts point out, there's big players that could make big wins. And it could come at the expense of our privacy.</p><p>Some tech companies are looking to make billions of dollars by creating and selling these contact tracing apps to governments desperate to stop the spread of the virus. These companies also have the potential to make big money for years to come with all the data collected from us - which can be sold to advertisers for large sums. And then there's the surveillance opportunities that this information offers to governments. All that data on our health, our movements and our interactions could be very tempting. PATRICK FAIR: My concern is that we need to be careful to have in place the controls necessary to keep the information that's collected, particularly the information that's aggregated safe from being used for other purposes.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: At the moment in Australia, our method of contact tracing is manual. That means we rely on people with the virus to remember where they've been and who they've been in contact with.</p><p>But the Australian Government is launching a smartphone app to do this digitally...</p><p>It's based on the one being used in Singapore - called Trace Together.</p><p>Basically the app records if you've spent 15 minutes or more in close proximity with someone who has COVID-19.</p><p>ACTOR: Play your part in fighting Covid-19 with just two simple steps: One, download Trace Together, and two, turn on your bluetooth.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: The government is developing the app with help from the private sector...namely companies like Atlassian who've done some initial engineering.</p><p>At this stage it won't be mandatory -- meaning we opt INto it. But the government hopes at least 40 percent of us do.</p><p>Patrick Fair says, it needs to be done right, because if we don't, then our privacy and civil liberties are at risk.</p><p>PATRICK FAIR: it demonstrates the possibility of using information about what people are doing under close supervision and that that will be a temptation for government agencies who can see other applications and uses for that to deploy it for regulatory and enforcement purposes.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: At the moment Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and China have been able to do pretty effective contact tracing with apps. But it's raised a lot of questions about what happens with that personal data now and beyond this pandemic.</p><p>JOE ROGAN: There's a real concern about this stuff.. Just give up a little bit of your civil liberties, give up a little bit of your freedom, and we're gonna keep you safe.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Particularly since these government agencies have been able to hone in on the data collected from people's phones.</p><p>That's worrying 20-year-old University student Milo Hsieh.</p><p>MILO HSIEH: they enforce it through, they track your phone to know where you are and call you every day.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: He returned home to Taiwan from studying in the US in mid March and he's been monitored by the government while in mandatory quarantine at his family home ever since.</p><p>MILO HSIEH: And yeah you're basically put under government surveillance for two weeks.\"</p><p>KAT GREGORY: If he goes out he could be fined thousands of dollars, thrown in jail or put in a quarantine facility. MILO HSIEH: One concern I personally have is which part of the government has been processing my data. Whether they're still doing it. How do I know that I'm no longer being tracked? All sorts of these questions arise. What is going on in the background, after this 14 day period?</p><p>KAT GREGORY: And it's not an easy question to answer right now - how his information will be used in the future is really unclear.</p><p>China is a more extreme example. Tech companies tap into smartphone users' GPS or geo-location points and assign them a colour code of green for low risk, yellow or red for high risk.</p><p>It's based on where they've been and if they've been exposed to virus carriers. That code then determines where that user can go.</p><p>This raises concerns about heavy government and police surveillance.</p><p>But very recently two of the world's biggest tech companies announced a system that they say could protect citizens' privacy as well as help stop the virus spread.</p><p>YOUTUBER: What timeline are we in? Answer. The confusing one, because Apple and Google have apparently joined forces...</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Soon both Google and Apple will send updates to users' smartphones that can support whatever sort of contact tracing app governments decide to use.</p><p>Although the system is based on bluetooth, not GPS, and would be encrypted.</p><p>PETER ECKERSLEY: But I think this kind of deployment by the technology companies is by far the fastest and most reliable way to do it.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Peter Eckersley spent many years working for the Electronic Frontier Foundation - which advocates for digital privacy.</p><p>He favours Apple and Google taking the lead here</p><p>This move gives them some control over the tech and app developer market and a chance to be seen as good corporate citizens.</p><p>They just need to ensure government agencies can't cash in too.</p><p>PETER ECKERSLEY: And certainly there's, you know, some track record of various governments, including the Australian government, being voracious in terms of trying to gobble, gobble up data like this and then often just sitting on it and not really using it necessarily that that effectively to help anyone but creating a lot of privacy and civil liberties risks. Fortunately, that doesn't have to be the way we respond here.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: The tech giants say it'll be hard for governments, other tech or advertising companies and even themselves to access any personal data because it wont be stored in a central database.</p><p>It's not clear whether the Australian Government is intending to work in sync with the Apple and Google updates... And that has some privacy experts concerned.</p><p>Firstly, if the Australian Govt wholly adopts the TraceTogether model.. Some of the information we put into the app will be shared with the health department - like what's been happening in Singapore and that's a bit different to the tech companies' model.</p><p>RHYS FENWICK: if you're found to be infected, it's not a voluntary thing. The Ministry of Health will take your number and it will take the people you've been in contact with.</p><p>That gives the government a lot of crucial information about people, their movements and their health status. That information is power - which could last well beyond COVID-19.</p><p>I've been chatting with Rhys Fenwick. He's part of a global non-profit organisation called CovidWatch.org</p><p>RHYS FENWICK: Once we establish the norm that it's okay for the government to use that once people have gotten you started something normal. And once people see it as something that's helpful. It could then be applied in a bunch of situations that are less urgent than a global pandemic.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Rhys' team has been developing a contact tracing app since January - one with privacy at its centre.</p><p>RHYS FENWICK: So we've moved away from our original GPS idea and instead for now, we're using Bluetooth to do contact tracing. KAT GREGORY: Why have you moved away from GPS to Bluetooth. RHYS FENWICK:A few reasons. Firstly, one of our biggest concerns is privacy. GPS data or your location data is very, very hard to anonymize.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Basically bluetooth picks up signals from people's phones near you and those connections are stored in the phone as unique number codes.</p><p>RHYS FENWICK: Now, if next week I come down with a dry cough and I go to the doctor, it turns out that I have Coronavirus or COVID-19, I will look on my phone and I'll see all the random numbers from all the people I connected with and I will post them on the app.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Then users who might have been in contact with him would be alerted.</p><p>The app's voluntary and relies on the user to enter their own data. That information is encrypted.</p><p>Singapore's TraceTogether model also uses bluetooth and isn't mandatory.</p><p>The difference is what happens to that data - with CovidWatch's app, it stays on the phone, so it's not shared with any government agencies.</p><p>But the Australian government is adamant our privacy will be protected. In a statement the Minister for Government Services Stuart Robert said:</p><p>ACTOR: The app is fully encrypted and cannot be accessed by anyone, including the user. The data of close contacts will only be shared with health authorities after an individual has tested positive for coronavirus and consents to it.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: In any case, it's easy to imagine that some big data companies will do well out of this pandemic.</p><p>RHYS FENWICK: obviously if anyone can create an app that can do this, it would be quite lucrative if they have the right connections. KAT GREGORY: How lucrative could it be? RHYS FENWICK: One one thing I can think I can give you is one contract that I saw. So this was not a hypothetical. This is a contract that I saw some of you replied with was asking for twenty five million dollars. KAT GREGORY: JeezRHYS FENWICK: It's pretty lucrative. Now, that was on the side of the small active companies looking to make it rich.</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Already the Australian Government has paid out more than 3 million dollars just to one technology company called Delv to help with the Government's COVID-19 information apps launched in March.</p><p>It appears that at this stage Atlassian hasn't won any significant paid government contract for its engineering work on the contact tracing app.</p><p>But the potential is huge for big tech companies.</p><p>RHYS FENWICK: When we're looking at large, well-established corporations that are already tied into government and to an extent into things like the military and kind of military contractors they would be looking at, well, upwards of twenty five million dollars</p><p>KAT GREGORY: Government Services Minister Stuart Robert has since provided further details about the contact tracing app. He says if a user confirms they have been diagnosed with coronavirus, their data will be sent to a secure national health storage facility and then passed on to state governments and that data will not be stored or used for surveillance.</p><p>ALICE BRENNAN: That's it from us here at Background Briefing for this week.</p><p>If you like what you hear don't forget to rate and review us wherever you get your podcasts in the apps.

As Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/business/apple-shazam-eu-data.html\">what interests Ms. Vestager about the transaction</url> is not the amount of money at stake, but the amount of data. In a rapidly expanding information economy, she believes the control of data is a new regulatory frontier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe\u2019re really making an effort to understand the different laws of data \u2014 how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview. \u201cWhat will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?\u201d</p><p>If not a household name in the United States, Ms. Vestager, 50 and a native of Denmark, is perhaps the world\u2019s most famous (or infamous, depending on where you stand) regulator. She has spent the past four years investigating American tech firms, finding them wanting and ordering them to pay billions of dollars in fines and back taxes.</p><p>Her rulings against Apple, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm have positioned the European Union, rather than Washington, as the world\u2019s de facto Big Tech regulator \u2014 and established Ms. Vestager as an international regulatory celebrity, if such a thing is not an oxymoron. She helped to inspire <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/watching/recommendations/borgen\">the lead character in a Danish television series</url>. Crowds flock to hear her speak.</p><p>\u201cEurope is acting to enforce antitrust laws where the U.S. is not,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, who feels that American regulators dropped the ball when they decided not to pursue a case against Google in 2013 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html\">Yelp is a longtime Google antagonist</url>). \u201cIronically, many of the complainants in the E.U. antitrust case against Google are U.S. companies, pursuing justice in Europe precisely because the U.S., has not acted,\u201d he said in an email.</p><p>While Ms. Vestager\u2019s global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.</p><p>Though a long shot, Ms. Vestager is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-margrethe-vestager-european-commmission-president/\">among the potential contenders</url> for president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. It is the most powerful job in the bloc \u2014 one never held by a woman, or by someone with her public profile.</p><p>Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.</p><p>Critics of Ms. Vestager include leaders of American tech companies who have crossed her and who take issue with both her approach and her facts; Republicans in Congress; some members of the Trump administration; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vestager-gets-vindictive-1474498823\">the Wall Street Journal editorial board</url>; and groups like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/resources/business-roundtable-letter-eu-heads-state-or-government-regarding-state-aid-investigations\">the Business Roundtable</url>, a conservative-leaning, pro-business collection of American chief executives.</p><p>Apple is especially aggrieved. In 2016, Ms. Vestager <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html\">ordered Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros in back taxes</url>, or about $15.5 billion, saying that the company had illegally received a tax break that was not available to others. Apple has begun paying the money into an escrow account, but both the company and Ireland have appealed the decision. They say it ignores how much tax Apple has already paid to Ireland, misrepresents the tax rate the company is subject to there, and reflects either a willful misreading or an ignorance of tax law.</p><p>Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.</p><p>\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.</p><p>Both Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief, have traveled to Brussels to argue their cases in person, apparently in vain. Last June, Ms. Vestager <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html\">fined Google \u20ac2.4 billion</url>, or about $2.8 billion, after concluding that it had unfairly used its search engine to favor its services over those of its rivals. It was the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history, and more than double similar fines levied by the United States.</p><p>Last May, she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/technology/facebook-european-union-fine-whatsapp.html\">fined Facebook \u20ac110 million</url>, or about $131 million, after concluding that it had misled the European authorities about its acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp. And in January, she       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/business/eu-qualcomm-fine-antitrust.html\">fined the American chip maker Qualcomm \u20ac997 million</url>, or about $1.2 billion, saying it had abused its market dominance to shut out competitors.</p><p>For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users\u2019 personal information.</p><p>As the top European official enforcing competition laws, Ms. Vestager has primarily concentrated on how a range of companies use, or abuse, their market dominance. But she has also emerged as a major voice of warning about the effect of tech firms on our habits, our privacy, our ability to make human connections and even democracy itself. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html\">Europe has a new data privacy law</url> that is to take effect May 25.)</p><p>[Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.]</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\u201d said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.</p><p>He added: \u201cI believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we\u2019re seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\u201d</p><p>Appearing last November at a tech summit meeting in Lisbon, Ms. Vestager was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/11/29/16712940/margrethe-vestager-european-commission-competition-regulation-recode-decode-kara-swisher-podcast\">interviewed onstage by Kara Swisher</url>, host of the Recode Decode podcast, as about 15,000 people looked on. Many in the audience were young techies who greeted the commissioner with something like euphoria, particularly when she declared that \u201cwe need to take our democracy back\u201d from social media.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what my generation looks for in a politician,\u201d said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \u201cThe moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She\u2019s the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\u201d</p><p>Other jurisdictions are following Europe\u2019s regulatory lead. Brazil, among other countries, has begun an antitrust case against Google, and one of the search giant\u2019s Brazilian competitors said last summer that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-firm-presses-ahead-with-antitrust-case-against-google/\">it would use the European arguments</url> in its own lawsuit. And in November,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">the state of Missouri opened an investigation</url> into whether Google violated the state\u2019s antitrust and consumer protection laws.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good if we can inspire each other globally,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.</p><p>She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)</p><p>Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She\u2019s not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \u201cBelieve in God, fear the church\u201d philosophy.)</p><p>She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party\u2019s parliamentary leader six years later \u2014 she was already national chairwoman \u2014 and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.</p><p>\u201cShe was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\u201d said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.</p><p>As for the boring part: \u201cShe has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\u201d Ms. Svane said in an interview. \u201cThe party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs \u2014 even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.</p><p>\u201cAll of us have multiple selves,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\u201d She learned to smile more, she said, \u201cto be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\u201d</p><p>Her party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits \u2014 forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises \u2014 while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.</p><p>She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \u201ca reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\u201d</p><p>In 2014, Denmark made her the country\u2019s appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.</p><p>Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager\u2019s husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.</p><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sometimes been asked if I\u2019m a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, \u2018They don\u2019t know any different \u2014 this is the mother they\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lately she has been thinking about power \u2014 what it is, who has it, how it is used \u2014 after reading the historian Mary Beard\u2019s latest book, \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/books/review-women-power-manifesto-mary-beard.html\">Women and Power</url>.\u201d \u201cThe #MeToo movement can be maybe the most important catalyst for decades in doing that,\u201d Ms. Vestager said. \u201cIt tears down our understanding of power.</p><p>\u201cPower is not something you own,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only something you\u2019re borrowing.\u201d</p><p>Milan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Ben Berke from Boston. </p><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager, </nameText></person>Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, is perhaps the world\u2019s most famous regulator, having spent the past four years investigating American tech firms, finding them wanting and ordering them to pay billions of dollars in fines and back taxes.

As Europe's competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what interests Ms. Vestager about the transaction is not the amount of money at stake, but the amount of data. In a rapidly expanding information economy, she believes the control of data is a new regulatory frontier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're really making an effort to understand the different laws of data - how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,\" Ms. Vestager said in an interview. \"What will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?\"</p><p>If not a household name in the United States, Ms. Vestager, 50 and a native of Denmark, is perhaps the world's most famous (or infamous<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis>depending on where you stand) regulator. She has spent the past four years investigating American tech firms, finding them wanting and ordering them to pay billions of dollars in fines and back taxes.</p><p>Her rulings against Apple, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm have positioned the European Union, rather than Washington, as the world's de facto Big Tech regulator - and established Ms. Vestager as an international regulatory celebrity, if such a thing is not an oxymoron. She helped to inspire the lead character in a Danish television series. Crowds flock to hear her speak.</p><p>\"Europe is acting to enforce antitrust laws where the U.S. is not,\" said Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, who feels that American regulators dropped the ball when they decided not to pursue a case against Google in 2013 (Yelp is a longtime Google antagonist). \"Ironically, many of the complainants in the E.U. antitrust case against Google are U.S. companies, pursuing justice in Europe precisely because the U.S., has not acted,\" he said in an email.</p><p>While Ms. Vestager's global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.</p><p>Though a long shot, Ms. Vestager is among the potential contenders for president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. It is the most powerful job in the bloc - one never held by a woman, or by someone with her public profile.</p><p>Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.</p><p>Critics of Ms. Vestager include leaders of American tech companies who have crossed her and who take issue with both her approach and her facts; Republicans in Congress; some members of the Trump administration; the Wall Street Journal editorial board; and groups like the Business Roundtable, a conservative-leaning, pro-business collection of American chief executives.</p><p>Apple is especially aggrieved. In 2016, Ms. Vestager ordered Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros in back taxes, or about $15.5 billion, saying that the company had illegally received a tax break that was not available to others. Apple has begun paying the money into an escrow account, but both the company and Ireland have appealed the decision. They say it ignores how much tax Apple has already paid to Ireland, misrepresents the tax rate the company is subject to there, and reflects either a willful misreading or an ignorance of tax law.</p><p>Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.</p><p>\"I think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\" said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.</p><p>Both Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief, have traveled to Brussels to argue their cases in person, apparently in vain. Last June, Ms. Vestager fined Google (EURO)2.4 billion, or about $2.8 billion, after concluding that it had unfairly used its search engine to favor its services over those of its rivals. It was the largest such penalty in the European Commission's history, and more than double similar fines levied by the United States.</p><p>Last May, she fined Facebook (EURO)110 million, or about $131 million, after concluding that it had misled the European authorities about its acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp. And in January, she fined the American chip maker Qualcomm (EURO)997 million, or about $1.2 billion, saying it had abused its market dominance to shut out competitors.</p><p>For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users' personal information.</p><p>As the top European official enforcing competition laws, Ms. Vestager has primarily concentrated on how a range of companies use, or abuse, their market dominance. But she has also emerged as a major voice of warning about the effect of tech firms on our habits, our privacy, our ability to make human connections and even democracy itself. (Europe has a new data privacy law that is to take effect May 25.)</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.</emphasis>]</p><p>\"What's fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\" said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.</p><p>He added: \"I believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we're seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\"</p><p>Appearing last November at a tech summit meeting in Lisbon, Ms. Vestager was interviewed onstage by Kara Swisher, host of the Recode Decode podcast, as about 15,000 people looked on. Many in the audience were young techies who greeted the commissioner with something like euphoria, particularly when she declared that \"we need to take our democracy back\" from social media.</p><p>\"She's what my generation looks for in a politician,\" said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \"The moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She's the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions are following Europe's regulatory lead. Brazil, among other countries, has begun an antitrust case against Google, and one of the search giant's Brazilian competitors said last summer that it would use the European arguments in its own lawsuit. And in November, the state of Missouri opened an investigation into whether Google violated the state's antitrust and consumer protection laws.</p><p>\"It's good if we can inspire each other globally,\" Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.</p><p>She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)</p><p>Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She's not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \"Believe in God, fear the church\" philosophy.)</p><p>She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party's parliamentary leader six years later - she was already national chairwoman - and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.</p><p>\"She was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\" said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.</p><p>As for the boring part: \"She has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\" Ms. Svane said in an interview. \"The party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\"</p><p>Ms. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs - even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.</p><p>\"All of us have multiple selves,\" she said. \"Being a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\" She learned to smile more, she said, \"to be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\"</p><p>Her party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits - forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises - while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.</p><p>She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \"a reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\"</p><p>In 2014, Denmark made her the country's appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.</p><p>Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \"Borgen,\" struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager's husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.</p><p>\"Here, it's more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\" she said. \"I have sometimes been asked if I'm a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, 'They don't know any different - this is the mother they've got.'\"</p><p>Lately she has been thinking about power - what it is, who has it, how it is used - after reading the historian Mary Beard's latest book, \"Women and Power.\" \"The #MeToo movement can be maybe the most important catalyst for decades in doing that,\" Ms. Vestager said. \"It tears down our understanding of power.</p><p>\"Power is not something you own,\" she continued. \"It's only something you're borrowing.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Milan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Ben Berke from Boston.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005852093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S9C-V0J1-DYR7-C1WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 5, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Now we know who it is we must rely upon to keep our children safe online. It's not our new Digital Safety Commissioner, since no such person exists just yet. It's not the children's advocates and champions, including the ISPCA, who are dismayed by the failings in the Government's Action Plan for Online Safety.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not the experts like Dr Mary Aiken or Professor Barry O'Sullivan who, despite being internationally recognised for their battles for cybersafety, weren't even consulted on this plan. And certainly not those teachers, like Terry O'Sullivan in Kerry, who have seen the benefits of banning smartphone ownership among their young pupils - he wasn't asked for his input, either.</p><p>No, it turns out that the people we'll be trusting to keep our children safe from online predators, groomers, gaming addictions, bullies, extreme pornography and graphic violence are... the shareholders in the technology companies.</p><p>That's right, the same shareholders whose dividends depend on the tech companies' profits. The same tech companies whose eye-watering revenues depend on their ability to keep on recruiting new customers. The same new customers who come, of necessity, from that teenage cohort whose mobile phone ownership, in this country, is as high as 100%.No other age group, according to the Government's own figures, spend as much time online, nor have such a high percentage of mobile phone ownership. Any tech company that isn't targeting them, actively and aggressively, isn't going to survive very long.</p><p>Any tech company that isn't focused on recruiting more teenager smartphone users isn't going to be issuing any fat dividends. And any tech company that isn't issuing fat dividends will not have happy shareholders.</p><p>And yet, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week he's relying on the shareholders to keep the tech companies in line. That's why he didn't threaten online service providers with legal consequences if they fail to take all necessary measures to keep children safe. It's not because this country is in the pocket of the big tech companies, perish the thought.</p><p>It's because, as he put it, 'they know that failing to act when it comes to online safety is damaging their reputation and potentially damaging their shareholder value in the longer term'.</p><p>Relying on the shareholders to monitor the tech companies is a bit like trusting the fox to guard the fowl house because, if he eats all the hens, he'll go hungry 'in the longer term'.</p><p>Like the fox, the shareholders will take what they can get, and then move on to fresh pickings. They will keep investing so long as the tech companies keep making money. And the tech companies will keep making money so long as they keep recruiting young customers.</p><p>And the tech companies will keep on recruiting younger and younger customers until our Government grows the cojones to punish them, with fines and sanctions, for failing to protect vulnerable young minds from the excesses of the net.</p><p>The Taoiseach's approach, effectively, is to wait until sufficient harm is done to shame the tech companies into regulating themselves. Imagine if he suggested lifting restrictions on the sale of cigarettes to under 18s on the same rationale? Imagine he reckoned that the tobacco companies would eventually remove the carcinogens and the addictive chemicals from their products, once people started dying of lung cancer, because of the reputational hit to their share prices? IMAGINE expecting the tobacco companies' shareholders, rolling in fat dividends from a whole new market of teenage smokers, to be the ones to act where governments did not? There was a time when cigarettes were marketed for their health benefits - they were believed to clear the lungs and reduce stress. In this instance, though, we can't even claim ignorance like the tobacco companies tried to back then: we all know how damaging smartphones are to children (though it will be years before the full scale of the consequences actually hits home).</p><p>The WHO has just formally classified online gaming as an addiction, and the evidence of the harmful impacts of early exposure to hardcore porn is impossible to dispute. Add in the risk from online predators and bullies, the sexting, the blackmailing, the decline in real-life friendships and activities, and the endlessly ingenious methods being devised, as we speak, by tech companies to increase and multiply online activity in ever-younger customers.</p><p>And we're reduced to relying on their shareholders, the drivers of this frenzied pursuit of ever-greater profits, to protect our children from their own endeavours.</p><p>Shareholders won't protect our children, Taoiseach, any more than tobacco companies protect smokers. That's not their job: but they'll doubtless be raising a glass to the fact that, when it comes to protecting children, you're not prepared to do yours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-139592845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSY-WJD1-DY9P-N44Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 14, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Instead, the city, the developers, and existing residents decide.</p><p><br/> This leads to conversations\u00a0like this CHS comment thread[1], where it's generally agreed that #8216;everyone on Capitol Hill#8217; is against small apartments. Of course they are - they already live on Capitol Hill! The apartments aren't being built for them.<br/> As a homeowner near Capitol Hill*, I wish more people who live on Capitol Hill   people whom I generally believe to be pro-social justice   would take a moment to think about the young people who want to live in a diverse, transit-friendly neighborhood with good access to jobs, but can't afford it. Not everyone works at a big tech firm or bought their house in the 70s.<br/> In other words, I wish these folks would take a moment to think about\u00a0people like Duane Taylor[2]:<br/>SEATTLE   Duane Taylor was studying the humanities in community college and living in his own place when he lost his job in a round of layoffs. Then he found, and lost, a second job. And a third.<br/> Now, with what he calls #8216;lowered standards#8217; and a tenuous new position at a Jack in the Box restaurant, Mr. Taylor, 24, does not make enough to rent an apartment or share one. He sleeps on a mat in a homeless shelter, except when his sister lets him crash on her couch.<br/> Duane would probably like an affordable apartment on Capitol Hill. I'm sure if he knew that attending a community meeting would increase the supply of affordable housing, he would have made the effort to attend. But I doubt he has access to CHS from his mat in the homeless shelter. And so the result is that #8216;everyone#8217; at the meeting opposes affordable apartments.<br/><br/>Look, we can debate forever whether these micro-apartments are #8216;legitimate#8217; or just #8216;regulatory loopholes#8217; being exploited. For whatever reason, housing is in demand and this is what's being supplied. There are a million reasons why a certain type of housing gets built over another. And the trend, in Capitol Hill and\u00a0elsewhere[3], has been to\u00a0oppose[4]\u00a0all\u00a0forms[5]\u00a0of zoning changes, #8216;micro-housing#8217; or not.<br/> Here's the broader point. Washington State has the most regressive tax system in the country**. Yet we manage to provide halfway-decent public services and quality of life for two and only two reasons: we're growing (6th fastest[6]), and we're young (19th[7]\u00a0youngest). That means more people paying in to the system than receiving benefits. If that growth starts to slow and the population starts to age, we'll be in deep fiscal doo-doo and quick. Having young people is the best way to ensure long-term growth. Just ask Japan.<br/> Fortunately for Seattle's fiscal future, the youngsters just keep on coming (yay\u00a0highest favorability rating[8]\u00a0in America!).\u00a0From the aforelinked article:<br/> Across town, Roman Tano, 20, woke up recently at YouthCare's James W. Ray Orion Center, another shelter for young adults that offers training programs. In October, its capacity grew to 20 beds from 15.<br/> Two months ago, Mr. Tano gave up an apartment in his native Dallas after losing his job. He sold his Toyota and sought opportunities in the Pacific Northwest[***].<br/> People like Duane and Roman are going to be paying for my retirement some day. I'm not sure why I'd welcome them with anything other than open arms****. It's good for Seattle and good for America (people are\u00a015% more productive[9]\u00a0when they live in cities).<br/> Unfortunately, there are only a few neighborhoods in this town suitable for young people seeking good jobs and car-free living. Capitol Hill is one of them. I'd like to see many more of these neighborhoods, through strategic up-zoning and and expanded transit network. Until then, we need a find a way to live together harmoniously, even if it means it's a bit harder to stash 2,000 pounds of privately-owned steel, glass and rubber in the public right-of-way.<br/> -<br/> *I live in Squire Park, which some unscrupulous real estate agents call Capitol Hill. Truth is, I couldn't afford real Capitol Hill! But I've got Ba Bar[10] now, so suck it, Hillsters! ** Washington's poorest residents pay 17 cents on the dollar in state and local taxes, more than any other state. Full report\u00a0here[11].<br/> *** How much lower is Mr. Tano's carbon footprint since he left Texas and ditched his Toyota? Yet another reason to bring people to temperate, walkable Seattle. **** A couch on Capitol Hill was my first bed in Seattle when I arrived here many years ago.<br/> [1]: <url

It has no enforceable mandates, it focuses overwhelmingly on technical fixes to what are also political, social and economic problems and its framing around terrorism and hate speech is far too narrow, treating the symptom of the problem while ignoring the underlying disease. We don't need to militarize the problem or play Whac-A-Mole with extremists: We need to govern platforms. The Christchurch Call won't accomplish that.</p><p>In its wake, this week, the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News, a group of parliamentarians from 14 countries, continues its work with a second set of hearings in Ottawa. The work of the committee (of which I will serve as a witness) has become a catalyst for a community of scholars, policy-makers and technologists who believe that a broader conversation about tech governance - one that squarely addresses problems embedded in the design of digital platforms themselves - is long overdue.</p><p>These problems include the financial model of what Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff calls \"surveillance capitalism,\" by which vast stores of data about our lives are used to target content designed to change our behaviour. The problems of surveillance capitalism include the way platforms manage their vast scale using opaque, commercially driven and poorly understood algorithmic systems and the market dominance of a small number of global companies with rapidly growing purchase on our social, political and economic lives.</p><p>While governments have been slow to take on the challenge of governing big tech, those that turned attention to this policy space in a serious way are coming to markedly similar conclusions. In short, that there are no silver bullets to the social and economic costs caused by the platform economy.</p><p>Instead, governments in France, Germany, Britain, the European Union, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and even a growing number of political leaders in the United States are articulating a need for a broad and comprehensive platform-governance agenda that is both nuanced to account for domestic differences in areas such as free-speech laws, and internationally coordinated to create sufficient market pressure.</p><p>The contours of this agenda are taking shape through three policy frameworks. The first: content policies. Democratic governments need to decide whether their speech laws require updating for the digital world and how they will be enforced. At the moment, we have delegated this regulatory role to the platforms, who hire thousands of moderators to enforce their terms of service agreements. Democratizing this system will involve difficult decisions around liability (who should be liable for speech online, the individual who spoke, or the company that amplified, and profited off, the speech?), moderation (who is responsible for implementation, the platforms who host and filter content, or the governments that are ultimately democratically accountable?) and transparency (how can we bring daylight to the secretive art of microtargeting, by which advertisers target and effectively influence narrow bands of people using extremely precise data?). Early experiments in content policy by Germany and France are yielding evidence of what works and what doesn't, examples upon which other countries can iterate.</p><p>Second: data policies. If we believe in the premise that society should be able to leverage public data for the public good, citizens should have far greater rights over the use, mobility and monetization of their data, and regulation must be matched with meaningful enforcement. Even the reported FTC fine of $5-billion to Facebook was seen as inconsequential by the markets. The EU General Data Protection Regulation provided an example for such a package that is being tinkered with in other jurisdictions, including in California, where California Consumer Privacy Act is poised to push Silicon Valley directly from its home state.</p><p>Third: competition policies. The EU and Britain have begun to explore new ways to curb the power of digital giants, and several of the U.S. Democratic presidential candidates have come out in favour of pursuing antitrust regulation. Such efforts could also include restrictions or rollbacks on how services and platforms are acquired and developed, as well as antitrust oversight that accounts for more than price increases in judging a company's market power, but also how much data it controls, whether it constrains innovation and whether it threatens consumer welfare.</p><p>On Monday, Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains built on Mr. Trudeau's speech, laying out the 10 principles of a proposed <url normalizedValue=\"https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ic.gc.ca%2Feic%2Fsite%2F062.nsf%2Feng%2Fh_00108.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CAdrianLee%40globeandmail.com%7C33124443006645f0c54d08d6df88f5e9%7C44376110425e46ab942e26c9518bfd03%7C1%7C0%7C636942176679277380&amp;sdata=ajpnyOElzDdib54o7U7L6E48fReAX%2Fh07gAcW5l4%2Fds%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ic.gc.ca%2Feic%2Fsite%2F062.nsf%2Feng%2Fh_00108.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CAdrianLee%40globeandmail.com%7C33124443006645f0c54d08d6df88f5e9%7C44376110425e46ab942e26c9518bfd03%7C1%7C0%7C636942176679277380&amp;sdata=ajpnyOElzDdib54o7U7L6E48fReAX%2Fh07gAcW5l4%2Fds%3D&amp;reserved=0</url>. It's a signal that Ottawa might finally be ready to take a broader view of its responsibilities. But whether this charter can be more than a collection of digital initiatives and instead become a co-ordinated policy agenda, implemented with the urgency that the problem demands, remains yet to be seen.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-who-will-answer-the-christchurch-call-nobody-if-tech-platforms/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-who-will-answer-the-christchurch-call-nobody-if-tech-platforms/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20190522ellipsis_L4QQV3PO5RHLZNP22FU3UOZJQE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5T-59V1-F072-J53M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1117\"/><timeReceived>6:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But who will benefit?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE DATA economy is a work in progress. Its economics still have to be worked out; its infrastructure and its businesses need to be fully built; geopolitical arrangements must be found. But there is one final major tension: between the wealth the data economy will create and how it will be distributed. The data economy\u2014or the \"second economy\", as Brian Arthur of the Santa Fe Institute terms it\u2014will make the world a more productive place no matter what, he predicts. But who gets what and how is less clear. \"We will move from an economy where the main challenge is to produce more and more efficiently,\" says Mr Arthur, \"to one where distribution of the wealth produced becomes the biggest issue.\"</p><p>The data economy as it exists today is already very unequal. It is dominated by a few big platforms. In the most recent quarter, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook made a combined profit of $55bn, more than the next five most valuable American tech firms over the past 12 months. This corporate inequality is largely the result of network effects\u2014economic forces that mean size begets size. A firm that can collect a lot of data, for instance, can make better use of artificial intelligence and attract more users, who in turn supply more data. Such firms can also recruit the best data scientists and have the cash to buy the best AI startups.</p><p>It is also becoming clear that, as the data economy expands, these sorts of dynamics will increasingly apply to non-tech companies and even countries. In many sectors, the race to become a dominant data platform is on. This is the mission of Compass, a startup, in residential property. It is one goal of Tesla in self-driving cars. And Apple and Google hope to repeat the trick in health care. As for countries, America and China account for 90% of the market capitalisation of the world's 70 largest platforms (see chart), Africa and Latin America for just 1%. Economies on both continents risk \"becoming mere providers of raw data...while having to pay for the digital intelligence produced,\" the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development recently warned.</p><p>Yet it is the skewed distribution of income between capital and labour that may turn out to be the most pressing problem of the data economy. As it grows, more labour will migrate into the mirror worlds, just as other economic activity will. It is not only that people will do more digitally, but they will perform actual \"data work\": generating the digital information needed to train and improve AI services. This can mean simply moving about online and providing feedback, as most people already do. But it will increasingly include more active tasks, such as labelling pictures, driving data-gathering vehicles and perhaps, one day, putting one's digital twin through its paces. This is the reason why some say AI should actually be called \"collective intelligence\": it takes in a lot of human input\u2014something big tech firms hate to admit. </p><p>If history is any guide, the risk is not so much that humans will automate themselves away. Previous technological disruptions have at times even increased labour's share of income, as new types of jobs emerged. The question is rather how much such data workers will be paid. As things stand, their work may become systematically undervalued, reckons Glen Weyl of Microsoft. One reason is the structure of online markets: big platforms are not just monopolies, but monopsonies, meaning that they have the power to hold down wages for data labour. Tellingly, none has ever really considered paying users for the data they generate. The economics of data, too, put pressure on the price of data labour: why, for instance, should a firm pay a high price for an individual's data if it can infer them cheaply from another person's information?</p><p>A data economy in which those who produce a large part of the main input are perennially underpaid is unlikely to be a healthy economy. Those with the greatest expertise, such as radiologists who can check the accuracy of an algorithm that recognises medical images, might hold back their knowledge and refuse to participate. Data workers with low pay and no say in the use of the information they generate will increasingly feel alienated, which could lower the quality of their work. And solving the problem through redistribution\u2014as Gavin Newsom, California's Democratic governor, wants to do with a \"digital dividend\" to be levied from tech giants and disbursed to the state's citizens\u2014would be a burden on the data economy and lead to trade conflicts. Such subsidies would be vulnerable to cuts as the political winds change.</p><p>All these complications explain why another proposed remedy keeps popping up: creating property rights on personal data to increase people's bargaining power. Yet this in itself would not help much. If most people understandably ignore the complex privacy policies that come with online services, how can they be expected to shop around for the best price for their data? And property rights could actually make things worse. Since most personal data are fundamentally a social construct to which more than one person has the right, individuals could engage in a race to the bottom. Each member of a family, say, could sell their genetic information and by doing so reveal much of their relatives' DNA.</p><p>Instead of giving citizens individual control over their data, they should hold it collectively, argues Mr Weyl. He and an activist organisation he helped found, RadicalxChange, want everyone to join what they call \"data co-operatives\".  These would act much like trade unions in the conventional economy. They would, among other things, negotiate rates for data work, ensure the quality of members' digital output, bill data firms that benefit from this output, and distribute the proceeds.</p><p>Like data trusts, robust data co-operatives will not emerge overnight. They need support from all involved. There are early signs that this may be forthcoming. Some Western countries may soon discuss a \"Data Freedom Act\", based on a draft by RadicalxChange, which would create a new regulated entity for that purpose. In a first for a tech-giant boss, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January called on the industry to show more respect for \"data dignity\"\u2014meaning to give people more control over their data and a bigger share of the value these data create. The public, for its part, is getting ever more concerned about what happens with its data. Roughly eight in ten Americans, for instance, now think they have very little or no control over the data which companies collect about them.</p><p>Expect debates about such ideas as data co-operatives to become more heated as the data economy grows. Encouragingly, as Mr Arthur points out, humanity has overcome a similar conundrum before. In the 1850s, the Industrial Revolution brought big increases in production, along with Dickensian social conditions. It took 100 years for societies to adapt; some never did. In the data economy, too, it will take a long time to build the appropriate mechanisms and institutions. No one yet worries that revolutions and wars will be fought over data, but there is no guarantee. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-QT8CEGC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y81-4F71-DY2R-219X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1218\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

It's that emphasis on \"new\" that will make it easier for the Justice Department to launch an investigation, say experts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Obama's biggest obstacle to its antitrust policy is that the federal courts have developed a number of defendant-favoring rulings that have made it difficult for the Justice Department to win,\" said Keith Hylton, antitrust professor at the Boston University School of Law. \"That makes tech attractive to the Obama team, because there will be cases that the courts haven't ruled on before.\"</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>top antitrust official, Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney, last week announced the reversal of a Bush-era policy that had weakened the government's ability to take on monopolies.</p><p>Also last week, European regulators levied a record $1.5 billion fine against Intel Corp.for unfairly paying computer makers to delay or even cancel products that contained chips made by rival AMD.</p><p>\"In the tech sector, it's possible to get such an advantage with a product, that nothing else is worth buying,\" said Martin Reynolds, analyst with tech consultancy Gartner. \"There becomes an inertia effect, where a product builds a critical mass, and it's difficult to move away from it.\"</p><p>Among the most common ways for leading tech firms to gain market share is through mergers and acquisitions. But with the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>vowing to be aggressive on the antitrust front, those types of tie-ups may now face much closer inspection in the United States.</p><p>Here's a snapshot of some potential losers and winners in the new antitrust era:</p><p>Losers: Experts said companies that dominate their fields are the most likely to draw the attention of antitrust officials.</p><p>Googletops most analysts' lists of tech companies likely to attract notice. It has already been down the antitrust road. During the Bush era, Googlecame under close examination when it tried to ink an advertising partnership with rival Yahoo -- a move that was subsequently abandoned.</p><p>\"Googlehas a durable network effect, becoming far more valuable to consumers than other competitors,\" said John Harkrider, co-chairman of the antitrust practice at Axinn Veltrop Harkrider LLP. \"Creating a competitive product to Googleisn't difficult, but it has so many people using it, that it has become difficult for anyone to break into that market.\"</p><p>Googlesaid it is not an antitrust target.</p><p>\"We know that competition on the Internet really is just one click away, so we work hard to make sure that we earn our users' trust and support every day,\" Googlespokesman Adam Kovacevich said. \"We make it easy for users to switch to competing services, help other business be more competitive by lowering their IT and advertising costs, and have developed open source browsers that foster competition.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft, which has already found itself on the opposite ends of U.S. and EU court rulings this decade, could again be under scrutiny because of the dominance of its Windows operating system.</p><p>Windows is cheap compared with competitors like Red Hat's Linux and Apple's Mac OS, and a large percentage of personal computers come with Windows pre-installed -- 83%, according to Gartner. Accordingly, a majority of software gets written exclusively for Windows-based computers and ultimately forces consumers to use Windows whether they want to or not, say experts.</p><p>Apple is another possible target. It dominates the MP3 player market with its iPod line with a near-80% market share. Apple has the capital to invest enough in development that it can come out with a new iPod every year. That keeps bringing back consumers who want the newest toy, said Reynolds.</p><p>Intel could be the target of more scrutiny, because it churns out new processors almost as quickly as Apple produces new iPods. Analysts say Intel's new microchips usually double the performance of chips made in the previous year. Intel has no rivals that can compete with that consistency because no other company has the revenue Intel has.</p><p>Winners: While smaller competitors of the dominant firms could have much to gain in the new landscape, there are some bigger companies that also stand to win.</p><p>Microsoft could find itself on both sides of the coin, as a ruling against Googlecould help it become a player in the online advertising world. Yahoo also stands to benefit from any ruling that goes against Google, as the former giant has struggled mightily to match Google's ad share.</p><p>AMD, which brought its case against Intel to the European Commission, could make out well if the Intel ruling is upheld after a looming appeal. Analysts say AMD actually took a bite out of Intel's market share several few years ago when it developed a dual-core processor for desktops, but the company has since struggled to compete with its much bigger rival.</p><p>\"When [AMD] has a product in the market that is compelling, they do very, very well,\" said Reynolds. \"When they don't, they do very badly.\"</p><p>And Oracle, which recently announced it will acquire Sun Microsystems, could gain share in the consumer software market if Microsoft is found to be in violation of antitrust laws. Oracle and Sun offer open-source software products for free, but they have still failed to compete with many Microsoft products, which have a strong consumer following.</p><p>Analysts say there's no guarantee that the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>will target tech companies in its anti-monopoly push, but they expect antitrust complaints to rise and big tech companies to be on high alert.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20090518tech_antitrust1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VR3-JGJ0-Y927-F01B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><timeReceived>6:17 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 18, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>BOSTON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

No longer</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A RECENT VIDEO of Elon Musk taking a spin in a new all-electric Volkswagen with Herbert Diess, the German carmaker's boss, set tongues wagging. VW was forced to deny that a deal with Tesla was in the offing. A deeper bromance between Mr Musk's firm and his main rival in the market for electric vehicles (EVs) looks unlikely. But the meeting highlights how the car industry is at last taking the impending EV revolution seriously. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Giant new businesses are gearing up to support the switch from petrol to electricity. Besides changing the way cars are propelled, this requires batteries, software to ensure these work in harmony with motors, and data harvested from cars that may one day allow them to drive themselves. Over 250 firms are manufacturing electric motors. Forty-seven battery factories are under construction. Anjan Kumar of Frost &amp; Sullivan, a consultancy, expects total new EV-battery capacity to go from 88 gigawatt-hours in 2019, enough to power Texas for less than two hours if plugged into the grid, to 1,400 gigawatt-hours in 2025. Established carmakers are pondering how to loosen the grip of big tech on software. </p><p>The total market capitalisation of listed makers of exclusively electric cars now exceeds $400bn. Add producers of batteries that go into them, and the EV-industrial complex, which makes fewer than 400,000 vehicles annually, is worth at least $670bn (not counting miners of lithium and other battery minerals). That is nearly three-fifths as much as traditional carmakers, which churn out 86m cars a year, nearly all of them petrol-powered (see chart 1). Call it the Teslaverse.</p><p>As that moniker suggests, Mr Musk's firm sits at its centre. In July it overtook Toyota as the world's most valuable carmaker, and kept accelerating\u2014never mind that it made 370,000 cars against Toyota's 10m and a fraction of the Japanese firm's revenues (see chart 2 on subsequent page). By August Tesla was worth over $450bn. A market correction lopped a third off its share price but it has since rebounded. What would it mean to take it seriously, as investors appear to be?</p><p>Car sales could fall by 25% in 2020 owing to pandemic disruption. But the share of EVs on the road will continue to grow as emissions regulations tighten, the price of batteries falls and the choice of models expands. Next year three in every 100 cars sold will be pure electric or a plug-in hybrid. The share may rise to 20-25% by 2030, equal to 20m new EVs a year.</p><p>At the moment Tesla is the \"apex predator\", says Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, a bank. It has been manufacturing EVs at scale longer than any other carmaker and sells more of them. Its elevated share price translates into the lowest cost of capital in the business. A growing offering, with a lorry and pickup soon to hit the road, will widen its appeal. It attracts the best engineers and possesses in Mr Musk, love him or loathe him, a leader with messianic zeal. </p><p>Mr Kumar puts Tesla two to three years ahead of rivals in battery technology. Its batteries have a higher energy density, which means better range and lower costs. On September 22nd Mr Musk is expected to present plans for new production capacity and fresh battery technology. Together, this would extend Tesla's cost advantage.</p><p>The firm's edge is even more pronounced in software. Rainer Mehl of Capgemini, a consultancy, calls Tesla cars a \"shell around the software and applications inside\". Thanks to vertically integrated manufacturing, systems have been interlinked from day one. As Olaf Sakkers of Maniv Mobility, an Israeli fund, explains, big carmakers have outsourced almost all their technology apart from internal-combustion engines to suppliers, and focused on assembly and marketing. This makes for a \"bird's nest of complexity\", says Mr Sakkers. Tesla's software and mechanics are seamless by comparison.</p><p>All this software means Teslas improve with age, thanks to regular \"over-the-air\" updates with new features, bug fixes and even performance upgrades. This makes up for a sometimes shabby finish and questionable reliability. Other big carmakers are five years behind, says Luke Gear of IDTechEX, a consulting firm. </p><p>Tesla also seems to have mostly put what Mr Musk has called \"production hell\" behind it. As Philippe Houchois of Jefferies, an investment bank, notes, a reputation for delivering models late and over budget has become one for being ahead of time and on budget. A rapidly built new factory in Shanghai began shipping in December and \"gigafactories\" are under construction in Berlin and Texas that will boost capacity from 700,000 units to 1.3m in 18 months, says Credit Suisse, a bank. Tesla cheerleaders talk of 3m-5m new Teslas annually by 2025, out of a global total of around 85m cars. Mr Musk eventually wants to make 20m a year. </p><p>Mr Jonas says that Tesla's current share price implies it will end up with 30-50% of the car market. This overlooks other sources of revenue: from selling batteries, its operating system or an EV \"skateboard\" of battery pack and running gear to which others can add a body (and in time more futuristic data and self-driving systems). Even the most wildly optimistic scenarios for Mr Musk's company, then, leave room in the Teslaverse for others.</p><p>Start with the established carmakers. Their lowly valuations may be read as implying they ought to give up trying to make the transition to EVs and quietly fade away. But even firms with the heftiest petrol-driven legacies should not be written off. Chinese carmakers show why. The government prodded them to go electric with tough mandates in the hope of dominating the future market. Around half the world's EVs are currently sold in China. The likes of Geely and BYD (which also makes batteries) want to expand overseas. </p><p>There, big Western carmakers face a slog. Though some suppliers, such as Aptiv, have spun off legacy operations to concentrate on EVs and self-driving technology, most remain bound to the internal combustion engine. And lots of car firms, in particular the German premium ones, must contend with powerful unions fearful of job losses resulting from the move to EVs' less complex\u2014and thus less labour-intensive\u2014mechanics. </p><p>Despite the difficulties, the industry is desperate to make the EV side work. Mr Kumar estimates that 60% of big car firms' research-and-development spending now goes on EVs, up from 5-10% in 2012. Morgan Stanley reckons big carmakers will invest up to $500bn in EVs over the next five years. According to Bernstein, a research firm, they have been \"terrible deployers of capital\" but they are \"waking up\". Potential big sellers on sale this year include VW's ID.3 and Ford's Mustang Mach-E.</p><p>VW is leading the charge. It will spend ?60bn ($71bn) by 2025 on EVs and digitisation. Carmakers typically develop 2-5% of software in-house. In an effort to reinvent itself as a software company, VW wants to boost its share to 60% by 2025. Other carmakers and suppliers harbour similar ambitions. Daimler's recent tie-up with Nvidia, a giant chipmaker, should allow remote updates by 2024. Aptiv already offers integrated software.</p><p>Big firms could create distinct units to lure outside capital and talent, and take risks, suggests Morgan Stanley's Mr Jonas. Some already are. General Motors (GM) has the Cruise self-driving arm, BMW has iVentures and Toyota has its Mobility Foundation. Another tactic is to invest in startups. On September 8th GM said it would buy an 11% stake in Nikola, a controversial electric-lorry firm, for $2bn (see box on previous page). Ford has backed Rivian, which hopes to crack the lucrative pickup market. </p><p>The likes of Nikola and Rivian are examples of another part of the Teslaverse. Although they face some big barriers, notably in manufacturing and distribution, raising money is not one of them. Capital is pouring in, helping cars move off the drawing board and into production. Chinese Tesla copycats have sprung up. In America Lucid Motors unveiled its first car at its headquarters near San Francisco on September 9th, with a Tesla-beating 800km range. One of its biggest backers is Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund. Lordstown, Fisker and Canoo are aiming to follow Nikola, which went public in June through a reverse merger and is now worth $13bn. Firms working on next-generation solid-state battery technology, such as QuantumScape, backed by vw and Bill Gates, plan to go public soon.</p><p>Several Chinese Tesla wannabes, such as Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto, are already listed in New York. They enjoy the benefit of cheap domestic labour, a huge local market and proximity of battery-makers such as BYD and CATL, the world's biggest such firm. Nio, which teetered on the brink of collapse in February before a bail-out by the city government of Hefei, where it has a big factory, is now valued at around $24bn.</p><p>Carmaking remains a tough business to crack. Assembling bodywork or brakes at scale is different to making gadgets or writing code. Dyson, a British maker of high-tech vacuum cleaners and hand-driers, sunk \u00a3500m ($640m) into developing an EV before scrapping the idea. Apple abandoned plans to make a car in 2016, though it is still investing in self-driving systems. Other tech giants are opting instead to invest in startups. In China Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have backed WM Motor, Nio and Xpeng, respectively. Amazon has put money into Rivian and ordered 100,000 of its electric lorries (in part to show it is serious about reducing its carbon footprint). </p><p>To survive in the Teslaverse, companies have to demonstrate they have valuable intellectual property that sets them apart, as many of the upstarts claim. But they must also prove they can sell and maintain their cars, where legacy carmakers have a long track-record. It is too early to divine the winners and losers. Even Mr Musk's firm could falter. But his vision of an electric future is already emerging victorious.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-TE8P68B</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VS-V9Y1-JBKN-B02S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

As one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill-prepared executives, their once-pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane. These last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills:</p><p>As a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of Saudi Arabian leaders (allegedly, but the killers did bring a bone saw), Silicon Valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for Magic Leap, and huge investments in hot public companies like Tesla. Most significantly: Saudis have invested about $45 billion in SoftBank\u2019s giant Vision Fund, which has in turn doused the tech landscape \u2014 $4.4 billion to WeWork, $250 million to Slack, and $300 million to the dog-walking app Wag. In total Uber has gotten almost $14 billion, either through direct investments from the Public Investment Fund or through the Saudis\u2019 funding of the Vision Fund. A billion here, a billion there and it all adds up.</p><p>[Kara Swisher answered your questions about her column <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1054842303922298880\">on Twitter</url>.]</p><p>Facebook introduced a new home video device called Portal, and promised that what could be seen as a surveillance tool would not share data for the sake of ad targeting. Soon after, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/10/16/17966102/facebook-portal-ad-targeting-data-collection\">reported by Recode</url>, Facebook admitted that \u201cdata about who you call and data about which apps you use on Portal can be used to target you with ads on other Facebook-owned properties.\u201d Oh. Um. That\u2019s awkward. </p><p>After agreeing to pay $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an ill-advised tweet about possible funding (from the Saudis, by the way), the Tesla co-founder Elon Musk proceeded to troll the regulatory agency on, you got it, Twitter. And even though the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226\">settlement called for some kind of control of his communications</url>, it appears that Mr. Musk will continue tweeting until someone steals his phone.</p><p>Finally, Google took six months to make public that user data on its social network, Google Plus, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/technology/google-plus-security-disclosure.html\">had been exposed</url> and that profiles of up to 500,000 users may have been compromised. While the service failed long ago, because it was pretty much designed by antisocial people, this lack of concern for privacy was profound.</p><p>Grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning. Then there are the broader issues that the denizens of Silicon Valley expect their employers to have a stance on: immigration, income inequality, artificial intelligence, automation, transgender rights, climate change, privacy, data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things. It\u2019s an ethical swamp out there.</p><p>That\u2019s why, in a recent interview, Marc Benioff, the co-chief executive and a founder of Salesforce, told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business \u2014 like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for Customs and Border Protection because of the government\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families at the border.</p><p>Amid much criticism, Mr. Benioff decided to keep the contract, but said he would focus more on social and political issues. </p><p>At a recent company event, he elaborated: \u201cWe can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically, but by bringing in the key advisers, supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane.\u201d</p><p>23andMe has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer.

Because slowly, then all at once, it feels like too many digital leaders have lost their minds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's probably no surprise, considering the complex problems the tech industry faces. As one ethical quandary after another has hit its profoundly ill-prepared executives, their once-pristine reputations have fallen like palm trees in a hurricane. These last two weeks alone show how tech is stumbling to react to big world issues armed with only bubble world skills:</p><p>As a journalist is beheaded and dismembered at the direction of Saudi Arabian leaders (allegedly, but the killers did bring a bone saw), Silicon Valley is swimming in oceans of money from the kingdom's Public Investment Fund. Saudi funding includes hundreds of millions for Magic Leap, and huge investments in hot public companies like Tesla. Most significantly: Saudis have invested about $45 billion in SoftBank's giant Vision Fund, which has in turn doused the tech landscape - $4.4 billion to WeWork, $250 million to Slack, and $300 million to the dog-walking app Wag. In total Uber has gotten almost $14 billion, either through direct investments from the Public Investment Fund or through the Saudis' funding of the Vision Fund. A billion here, a billion there and it all adds up.</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kara Swisher will answer your questions about this column on Twitter on Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@KaraSwisher</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis>]</p><p>Facebook introduced a new home video device called Portal, and promised that what could be seen as a surveillance tool would not share data for the sake of ad targeting. Soon after, as reported by Recode, Facebook admitted that \"data about who you call and data about which apps you use on Portal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">can</emphasis> be used to target you with ads on other Facebook-owned properties.\" Oh. Um. That's awkward.</p><p>After agreeing to pay $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an ill-advised tweet about possible funding (from the Saudis, by the way), the Tesla co-founder Elon Musk proceeded to troll the regulatory agency on, you got it, Twitter. And even though the settlement called for some kind of control of his communications, it appears that Mr. Musk will continue tweeting until someone steals his phone.</p><p>Finally, Google took six months to make public that user data on its social network, Google Plus, had been exposed and that profiles of up to 500,000 users may have been compromised. While the service failed long ago, because it was pretty much designed by antisocial people, this lack of concern for privacy was profound.</p><p>Grappling with what to say and do about the disasters they themselves create is only the beginning. Then there are the broader issues that the denizens of Silicon Valley expect their employers to have a stance on: immigration, income inequality, artificial intelligence, automation, transgender rights, climate change, privacy, data rights and whether tech companies should be helping the government do controversial things. It's an ethical swamp out there.</p><p>That's why, in a recent interview, Marc Benioff, the co-chief executive and a founder of Salesforce, told me he was in the process of hiring a chief ethical officer to help anticipate and address any thorny conundrums it might encounter as a business - like the decision it had to make a few months back about whether it should stop providing recruitment software for Customs and Border Protection because of the government's policy of separating immigrant families at the border.</p><p>Amid much criticism, Mr. Benioff decided to keep the contract, but said he would focus more on social and political issues.</p><p>At a recent company event, he elaborated: \"We can have a structured conversation not just with our own employees myopically, but by bringing in the key advisers, supporters and pundits and philosophers and everybody necessary to ask the question if what we are doing today is ethical and humane.\"</p><p>23andMe has also toyed with the idea of hiring a chief ethics officer. In an interview I did this week with its chief executive, Anne Wojcicki, she said the genetics company had even interviewed candidates, but that many of them wanted to remain in academia to be freer to ponder these issues. She acknowledged that the collection of DNA data is rife with ethical considerations, but said, \"I think it has to be our management and leaders who have to add this to our skill set, rather than just hire one person to determine this.\"</p><p>When asked about the idea of a single source of wisdom on ethics, some point out that legal or diversity/inclusion departments are designed for that purpose and that the ethics should really come from the top - the chief executive.</p><p>Also of concern is the possibility that a single person would not get listened to or, worse, get steamrollered.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has a vision that he'd like Congress to share.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Lawmakers seem to agree that there are too few tech companies with too much power, and that Big Tech needs to be regulated. What they can't agree on is how do it: Break companies up, tax them more, apply privacy rules, remove liability protections. The list goes on. There are lots of options, none particularly well developed, and little consensus on what might work.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the chief executive of Facebook, appeared to take advantage of this when he made his own proposal for regulation in a Washington Post op-ed. According to Corynne McSherry, the legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>proposals were ''an effort to get ahead'' of the many suggestions already on the table and ''shape what happens down the pike.''</p><p>  The proposals were not earth-shattering; most had been suggested by policymakers already, or even put into effect in other parts of the world. But Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>fleshed them out into one of the more actionable calls for tech regulation that we've yet seen.</p><p>  They may seem like an appealing first draft of the rules to some lawmakers. An obvious question is: Should they be?</p><p>  ''Legislation is written by legislators, and that is what they're elected to do -- no industry can replace that,'' said Jason Oxman, the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association. He added that ''the tech industry will want to make its voice heard,'' and that ''it's certainly our hope that Congress will balance a need to encourage innovation'' with issues like maintaining privacy.</p><p>  Ms. McSherry said she was ''very concerned'' about the idea that policymakers might look to the chief executives of Silicon Valley for guidance on what they should do.</p><p>  ''It's sort of asking the foxes how best to guard the henhouse,'' she said.</p><p>  My colleague Mike Isaac read between the lines of what Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>wrote. And all of his proposals appear to suggest regulation that would strengthen Facebook -- by allowing Facebook to squash competitors, say, or better enable it to meld its main platform with its other properties, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>  If regulation is to genuinely curb Big Tech's power, Congress may be better served by spending less time on theatrical tech C.E.O. testimony and more time listening to the technologists who built the systems they're trying to regulate and to the people who use them.</p><p>  Fooling A.I. at the wheel</p><p>  Don't panic, but some stickers could help run an autonomous car off the road.</p><p>  Driverless cars use artificial intelligence, often based on so-called neural networks, to interpret camera images. Such software can identify a stop sign. But small visual tweaks to an object, barely observable to humans, can fire connections in neural networks to convince them they're looking at something else, like a speed-limit sign.</p><p>  Researchers from the Keen Security Lab, part of the technology company Tencent, reported that a similar trick forced an autonomous car to switch lanes. Tesla's Autopilot software, they showed, uses only camera data to detect lanes, and small visual tweaks to a road surface could cause its neural networks to think road markings were veering. In tests, stickers on a road caused a Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode to swerve into another lane.</p><p>Tesla said in a statement that ''a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should always be prepared to do so.''</p><p>  But it demonstrates the fragility of current A.I. ''You would expect the system to behave robustly,'' said Marta Kwiatkowska, a professor of computing systems at the University of Oxford. ''If you change the input very slightly, the output should change only very slightly.''</p><p>  Solving the problem isn't just about improving A.I. The entire system needs to be made more robust by creating additional checks using other sensors, Ms. Kwiatkowska said. ''We need to engineer these systems better,'' she said.</p><p>  With harmful content, it's complicated</p><p>  There's a lot of awful stuff online. Not liking it is easy. Actually overcoming it is hard.</p><p>  Silicon Valley workers are aware of the problem. On Tuesday, Bloomberg published a report that said YouTube executives had ignored employee proposals to ''change recommendations and curb conspiracies.'' Their suggestions were reportedly ''sacrificed for engagement.''</p><p>  Executives, like YouTube's chief product officer, Neal Mohan, insist that the algorithms may be designed to keep people watching but not to recommend things like extremist content, even if that's what they end up doing. After all, it ''doesn't monetize,'' he said, because advertisers ''don't want to be associated with this sort of content.''</p><p>  But recommend they do, so calls for rules that force content takedowns are unsurprising. The most recent: a law passed in Australia on Thursday, which threatens big fines for companies if they fail to swiftly remove violent material.</p><p>  Sadly, it may not be that easy to solve the whole harmful content problem:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 First, defining ''harmful'' is a minefield. As Ms. McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation put it to me, one person's harmful content can be another's political expression.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 That feeds a second issue: In the United States, moves toward mandatory takedowns of specific kinds of content could quickly run afoul of the First Amendment.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Third, the technical challenge is huge. Tech companies have struggled for years to do it with the most troubling of content, and promises that A.I. will solve the problem have yet to bear fruit.</p><p>  None of this excuses the proliferation of harmful content online. But it helps explain why progress is so slow.</p><p>  And some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>Facebook user data spilled out again. Researchers found records for hundreds of millions of users stored publicly by a third party on Amazon's cloud servers. (Also: Facebook might start a news service.)</p><p>  Wall Street is getting cold feet over cryptocurrencies. The plans of big banks are faltering, showing how hard it is to take a fringe technology into mainstream finance.</p><p>  What actually happens in a venture capital pitch? This, according to Wired.</p><p>  Washington is preparing for a 5G future including Huawei. The world doesn't hear America's security concerns, so the government is reportedly coming to terms with using ''dirty networks.'' (Also: Chicago and Minneapolis became the first cities in the United States to have 5G.)</p><p>  The biggest lobbyist for New York's congestion charge? Uber, which spent $2 million backing the tolls. It's trying to fend off claims that it causes congestion.</p><p>  A.I. experts want Amazon to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. They argue that it is biased against women and people of color.</p><p>  Banning Netflix from the Oscars could violate antitrust laws. An exclusion that crimps movie sales could be anticompetitive.</p><p>  Want a smart home but don't know where to start?

And although some central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, have started to tighten monetary policy this is still at the margins and therefore unlikely to puncture equity markets in the near term, argues Mr Niven. But the change in policy environment means investors should expect 2018 to be much more volatile than last year.</p><p>In this choppier environment companies with competitive advantages that operate within industries with high barriers to entry are the most profitable places to be, and there are many big tech examples of these.</p><p>\"What you want is a business with what [renowned US investor] Warren Buffett calls a 'moat' - companies that have a strong market position they can exploit to generate profit for shareholders,\" explains Mr Niven. \"People can debate Amazon's valuations, but what it is building is a moat that's as wide as possible which is why it's extending into several areas, not just to disrupt but to extend the competitive advantage it has. At some point, Amazon will need to start showing high levels of profitability, but other companies such as Facebook and Google are operating at high margins in terms of profits as they have very strong positions in terms of online search, where Google is absolutely dominant, and advertising, where Facebook is strong.\"</p><p>These companies' rich valuations mean there is not much room for error if they disappoint on earnings.

It may explain why the gig economy companies are working at a state rather than the federal level.Rest breaks for truckersCalifornia amended their wage and hour law torequire employers give truckers a break after five hours of service.[3]That law offered more protections than federal law, At the end of 2018,the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ruled that California law on breaks was preempted by federal law.[4]There is nothing new about employers running to the federal government to undo state laws that improve workers' rights \u2014those efforts date back at least to the Dred Scott decision in the 1857.So what are the chances that AB5 will suffer the same fate as California's efforts to insure fair pay and working conditions for truckers? I think AB5 will be harder to undo on a federal level for a few reasons.Federalism issuesPreemption of federal law by state law has a better chance of succeeding if there is a strong constitutional basis for federal regulation. </p><p>In the case of trucking, the interstate commerce clause gives the federal government a solid basis for regulating trucking.It's easier to argue that federal law should preempt state law in an industry that clearly falls within Congressional power to regulate.[5]In contrast, workers' compensation laws arestate-based laws enacted under state police powers.[6]Workers' compensation is a form of insurance and Congress has largely delegated insurance regulation to the states. So at least for the workers' compensation provisions of AB5, I believe there is almost no chance that federal courts would rule that part of the legislation would be preempted by federal court.Political reasonsThe reason the trucking industry had to rely on a ruling by the FMSCA to invalidate California's law on detention pay for truckers, was that it was unable to get theso-called Denham amendment passed[7]. In other words, the trucking industry failed to change the law legislatively, so they ran to the executive branch rule making process to get what they wanted.I started paying close attention to worker classification and portable benefit schemes as they related to the gig economy in 2015. I read a paper from the Democratic-leaning Hamilton Project promoting portable benefit schemes for gig economy workers.Part of that paper included a quote from former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin stating that there needed to be reform of labor laws for the 21st century. Rubin was an architect of financial deregulation in the 1990s, so the idea of him doing the same for labor laws horrified me.[8]What horrified me was the prospect of Wall Street and Silicon Valley influenced Democrats working with Republicans in some 'grand bargain' or feat of 'bi-partisanship' to hammer the coffin nail in state workers' compensation laws from a federal level.But if the trucking industry can't even pass the Denham amendment. (BTW Representative Jeff Denham was defeated in 2018[9]), a federal grand bargain on the gig economy seems far-fetched. The Democratic Party, at least on paper, has become astronger supporter of worker rights[10]over the last four years.Labor militancy has made a comeback[11]in the last four years. The tech industry has also seen its reputation and popularity lag[12]over the last four years.Gig economy companies are stillattempting to weaken America's already weak employment laws[13], but the passage of AB5 in California shows their efforts can by stymied.

It may explain why the gig economy companies are working at a state rather than the federal level. Rest breaks for truckers California amended their wage and hour law to require employers give truckers a break after five hours of service.[3] That law offered more protections than federal law, At the end of 2018, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ruled that California law on breaks was preempted by federal law.[4] There is nothing new about employers running to the federal government to undo state laws that improve workers' rights \u2014 those efforts date back at least to the Dred Scott decision in the 1857.[5] So what are the chances that AB5 will suffer the same fate as California's efforts to insure fair pay and working conditions for truckers?</p><p> I think AB5 will be harder to undo on a federal level for a few reasons. Federalism issues Preemption of federal law by state law has a better chance of succeeding if there is a strong constitutional basis for federal regulation. In the case of trucking, the interstate commerce clause gives the federal government a solid basis for regulating trucking. It's easier to argue that federal law should preempt state law in an industry that clearly falls within Congressional power to regulate.[6] In contrast, workers' compensation laws are state-based laws enacted under state police powers.[7] Workers' compensation is a form of insurance and Congress has largely delegated insurance regulation to the states. So at least for the workers' compensation provisions of AB5, I believe there is almost no chance that federal courts would rule that part of the legislation would be preempted by federal court. Political reasons The reason the trucking industry had to rely on a ruling by the FMSCA to invalidate California's law on detention pay for truckers, was that it was unable to get the so-called Denham amendment passed[8]. In other words, the trucking industry failed to change the law legislatively, so they ran to the executive branch rule making process to get what they wanted. I started paying close attention to worker classification and portable benefit schemes as they related to the gig economy in 2015. I read a paper from the Democratic-leaning Hamilton Project promoting portable benefit schemes for gig economy workers. Part of that paper included a quote from former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin stating that there needed to be reform of labor laws for the 21st century. Rubin was an architect of financial deregulation in the 1990s, so the idea of him doing the same for labor laws horrified me.[9] What horrified me was the prospect of Wall Street and Silicon Valley influenced Democrats working with Republicans in some 'grand bargain' or feat of 'bi-partisanship' to hammer the coffin nail in state workers' compensation laws from a federal level. But if the trucking industry can't even pass the Denham amendment. (BTW Representative Jeff Denham was defeated in 2018[10]), a federal grand bargain on the gig economy seems far-fetched. The Democratic Party, at least on paper, has become a stronger supporter of worker rights[11] over the last four years. Labor militancy has made a comeback[12] in the last four years. The tech industry has also seen its reputation and popularity lag[13] over the last four years. Gig economy companies are still attempting to weaken America's already weak employment laws[14], but the passage of AB5 in California shows their efforts can by stymied.

Apple will meet Epic Games on Sept. 28 in federal court to explain the App Store erasure of the Fortnite video game. Then regulatory hearings will resume on Sept. 30 in Washington, D.C., following testimony from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google executives in late July. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice could file antitrust charges against Google as early as this week.    All three storylines involve fears that a small handful of gatekeepers have taken over the \u201cinformation superhighway\u201d and turned it into a private toll road. Some critics see the domination and worry about the loss of consumer privacy. Others worry about the manipulation of political discourse.    Both concerns have merit. The economy runs on information, and Big Tech companies have more than the National Security Agency. They know what is in your fridge, your wallet and your playlist. They know who your child chats with at 2 a.m. They know about your medical condition, job history and voting record.     The goal is not just to track your preferences, but to shape them. That\u2019s what marketing is about. People who control the algorithms decide what you see and when. They can make products and services disappear\u2014like Fortnite\u2014and they can do the same thing with ideas. \u201cIncorrect\u201d or contrary views, a valuable part of political discourse, can be filtered out so they fail to reach an audience.    That\u2019s a lot of power for any company run by mere mortals. Many people, frustrated with the situation, assume government intervention is the only way to fight back. Who else has the resources to make tech CEOs squirm in their seats?    Unfortunately, tighter regulations are not the answer. Rather than helping, inviting the government to expand its influence only makes things worse. Society already has seen the inevitable results in health care, agriculture and trucking during Covid-19. Ronald Reagan was not far off when he said: \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d    The main reason, of course, is that government is run by mere mortals, just like Silicon Valley. Problems that originate with humans do not disappear by putting different humans in charge\u2014especially when the replacement overseers are career bureaucrats with agendas of their own. They might not care about quarterly returns, but they do allow elections and political ambitions to shape their decisions.    History is full of interventions, designed to help consumers and competitors, that hurt them instead. One prominent example is the antitrust complaint against Microsoft. Prosecutors accused the tech giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly for Windows, and then giving an unfair advantage to its Internet Explorer browser by preinstalling it on the operating system.    The saga, which started in 1998, dragged on until 2011, when an antitrust consent decree finally expired. In technology years, that represents multiple lifetimes. Events during this period show four reasons why government intervention is not necessary, and usually backfires.     Markets Correct Flaws    When a judge first considered the case against Microsoft, he saw no way other than court decree to open the market to other companies. Fines and fees would not be enough, he determined, so he ordered Microsoft to be split up.    The drastic measure, later reversed, proved unnecessary. The market took care of itself through innovation rather than government meddling. First came superior browsers from upstarts like Mozilla and Google\u2014companies that nobody had heard of in 1998. Then came smartphones, tablets and other handheld devices. Windows remains dominant on desktops and laptops, but more than half of global online traffic in 2020 is mobile. Nobody saw that coming in 1998 either.    People who look at markets often see them as static. They assume that conditions today are permanent. But if they pause and consider how many products and services essential to their lives did not yet exist 25 years ago, a more accurate picture emerges. This is the thought experiment I do with my executive MBA students, and the results are staggering.    Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google seem invincible. But the technological landscape will look drastically different in 2045 or even 2025. If regulators get out of the way, solutions to Big Tech control issues will come through new technologies, products and services.    Lobbying Supplants Innovation    Microsoft could not focus on continuous improvement during its long battle with prosecutors. Instead, the company had to divert billions of dollars to defend itself in court. The extra expense was great for attorneys, but not consumers. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, speaking at the New York Times DealBook Conference in 2019, said the antitrust distraction prevented Microsoft from launching Windows Mobile in a timely manner.    While Gates and Microsoft had steered clear of Washington politics prior to the government lawsuit, competitors had curried favor by spending millions of dollars in campaign contributions, hiring lobbyists and retaining attorneys. When companies like Netscape found themselves unable to provide a superior value proposition to consumers, they cashed in their political favors by calling for an antitrust suit.    As the Washington Post chronicles , Microsoft was forced to adopt similar tactics as a matter of survival. Tech giants today routinely spend big on lobbying. They have become masters of schmoozing as much as coding. The result is a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d where lobbying and cronyism serve as substitutes for innovation and quality.    Regulations Crush Startups    The government-created AT&amp;T monopoly, which I discuss in last week\u2019s column , highlights what can go wrong when policymakers rather than consumers start picking winners and losers. Instead of leveling the playing field, new regulations tend to favor companies with connections. As market barriers increase, startup firms get left behind because they cannot afford to play the influence game.    Uber and Lyft feel the burden when they challenge the taxi industry. Something similar happens when state and local leaders rig the rules against food trucks to protect brick-and-mortar restaurants, against home-based daycare centers to protect regional chains, or against hairstylists to protect cosmetology schools.    Ultimately, regulations designed to benefit consumers hurt them instead by stifling innovation. Big firms sometimes disrupt the status quo, but market upheaval usually starts small. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google understand the pattern because that\u2019s how they emerged. Policymakers interfere with the creative process when they impose a top-down approach instead.    Censure Demoralizes Innovators    By punishing innovation, policymakers also send a chilling message: Don\u2019t grow too big through entrepreneurial activity, or we will stop celebrating your value creation and damn you instead. The narrative usually flips somewhere between the first round of fundraising and the initial public offering.    Entrepreneurs who succeed because they are good at what they do find it demoralizing suddenly to be cast as villains. The opposite happens with athletes and entertainers. Fans do not stop cheering when their favorite basketball players or actors sign multimillion-dollar deals. Nobody talks about greed or pay gaps.    The discrepancy can be soul-draining, even for strong leaders like Gates at Microsoft. His long battle with government prosecutors left him exhausted, and he stepped down two months after the settlement. People often measure the cost of litigation based on judgement amounts. But everyone paid, along with Microsoft, for the lost creative energy.    Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google now face their turn. Public demand for government intervention has swelled, but policymakers will do more harm than good if they interfere too much in the market. Big Tech might have problems. But Big Government is worse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the tech industry - which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world's knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button - has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that's just the beginning of the list.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \"We have a major monopoly problem.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Ms. Warren's and Ms. Klobuchar's ideas was surprisingly receptive.</p><p>\"We've got to break these guys apart,\" Ms. Warren said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\" The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.</p><p>\"A billionaire, right?\" Ms. Warren noted.</p><p>For decades, a politician who mentioned \"antitrust\" was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \"Antitrust\" was relegated to the shelf with \"socialism\" and \"wealth inequality\" and \"higher taxes for higher incomes.\"</p><p>It didn't help that what could be called \"maximum antitrust\" - when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up - has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its case against Microsoft in 2001. Only AT&amp;amp;T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government's point of view.</p><p>The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what's best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship.</p><p>\"Something has definitely changed,\" said Geoffrey A. Manne, the founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \"Most voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there's also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\"</p><p>Mr. Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T, eviscerated Ms. Warren's proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post. They wrote that the senator's plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \"platform utilities\" would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak.</p><p>And yet, Mr. Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.</p><p>\"There is a long history in America - just not a recent one - of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\" he said. \"We may be at that moment again.\"</p><p>The financial firms were predatory last decade, exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability. Google and Facebook, by contrast, offer their services for free, while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible. That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus, which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers directly suffer by paying higher prices.</p><p>Nothing is ever really free, of course, and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves. How most users feel about this seems up in the air, as evidenced by a new SurveyMonkey poll done for the news site Axios.</p><p>The headline finding was that \"a growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis.\" But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using. Twenty-one percent said they would pay less than $1 a month, and no more, for the right.</p><p>Users, it seems, want it both ways: privacy and free services. This is the contradiction at the heart of the internet.</p><p>Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Ms. Warren's proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \"The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\" he said.</p><p>But Mr. Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies' worries. \"A likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,\" he said. \"Even just the rhetoric can complicate their lives and put pressure going forward.\"</p><p>That is already happening. One of the anti-competitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge.</p><p>Amazon ended this practice in Europe six years ago, but it continued in the United States. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, asked for regulators to investigate in December. Last week, Amazon confirmed that it had dropped the requirement.</p><p>Antitrust talk emboldens competitors as well. Google controls much of the market for online ads in Australia, just as it does elsewhere. That presents a big problem for News Corporation, which owns eight of the 10 largest papers in the country.</p><p>The Rupert Murdoch-controlled media conglomerate asked Australian regulators last week to take the \"very serious step\" of breaking up Google in the country because of the \"unparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.\"</p><p>In this new environment, winning can soon look a lot like losing.</p><p>Amazon opposed a proposal in Seattle last spring for a corporate tax to help the homeless, and succeeded in getting it cut in half. Then the retailer decided it just couldn't live with the measure at all. A repeal effort began. The City Council killed the tax just as it was going into effect.</p><p>At the time, that looked like another triumph for Amazon. But in the months since, even some of those who thought the tax was a bad idea have found their views evolving.</p><p>\"My feelings about Amazon have changed, and not in a good way,\" said Julie Shapiro, a Seattle University professor of family law. \"I think they want the ability to be a bully and, once they have it, they're quite willing to use it.\"</p><p>That is the crux of the issue: Can a company be dominant without coming off as a bully? It is no accident that the company that was the subject of the biggest antitrust action in the last quarter-century - Microsoft - had a terrible reputation in the tech community. Voters love innovation, convenience and entrepreneurs. They don't love bullies.</p><p>Amazon failed to avoid bullying behavior in its now-abandoned bid to build a headquarters in New York, and Facebook likewise failed last week when it took down Ms. Warren's posts about Facebook having too much power. The company, which said the posts had violated the use of its logo, quickly restored them, but the public relations damage had been done.</p><p>\"Curious why I think FB has too much power?\" Ms. Warren tweeted. \"Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006408546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-XSM1-DYR7-C3F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

If the Wi-Fi goes down on an airplane, everyone turns into bratty toddlers. But that technology was unfathomable only a few years ago. Now, it is an expectation. The delta between something being nice to have and becoming a need has decreased very quickly. Five years ago, firms might have been asking what is our mobile strategy? Now, without a mobile experience, will consumers even want to trade with you? That has happened so quickly. Technology has transformed from a nicety to a necessity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even in our personal lives, society has changed so much. It wasn't that long ago when we as parents were telling our children to never get into a stranger's car. Instead, you should yell, shout and run away. Now, we can go to our phones, pick out our favorite ride-sharing app, get into a stranger's car and pay for the privilege. Fundamentally, the tech that went into creating these apps is shaping the consumer experience and those same consumers are now our clients. The question becomes how do we make sure these day-to-day experiences are on par with the experiences clients have when they meet with their RIAs.</p><p>What are some of the technological challenges facing advisors?</p><p>I'm not a cook by any means, but you and I could have the same set of ingredients and come up with different dishes. The real challenges are how advisors are using the technology. There is a real inflection point happening and a lot of technologies are starting to reach a certain maturation level - or an iPhone moment where they have the utility and ubiquity. The real challenge becomes how do we combine the power of virtual reality and AI and do it in a way that is solving real problems.</p><p>Does voice-recognition technology really matter to advisors?</p><p>Advisor workflow is becoming an untethered experience. Advisors can come into the office in the morning and quickly get caught up on what the markets are doing and what has happened with a book of business. You could pull that up on a computer, or you could be sitting in your office talking to Alexa with on-demand information.</p><p>Voice recognition technology is helping the client experience as well. Clients can get help breaking down market information and get ideas and guidance about what the data means. It helps make sense out of the information. They can check balances and positions.</p><p>What's holding back innovation?</p><p>The regulation piece is an important part of this industry and we often use regulation almost as an excuse. Is it really a regulation problem or do we perceive regulation as the problem? The secret sauce is partnering with the right financial services firms that are having internal conversations about innovation and that have real skin in the game. Those are ways to kick start the metabolism. Are things harder in financial services because of regulation? At the end of the day, those guardrails are there for good reason: Protecting the end clients and serving their needs. Are we solving problems for advisors and clients in a way that meets that same ethos?</p><p>Are the FAANGS coming for the U.S. financial services market?</p><p>Any good business should have a healthy sense of paranoia. Any business is disruptable. These technology companies have brand recognition and loyalty and networks with audience sizes that are just massive. They are able to capture our attention span and once you have my attention it's a lot easier to tell me to do something and I'm more prone to do it. We just saw Apple make the move into credit cards with Goldman Sachs. Everyone should definitely be keeping a watchful eye.</p><p>The big tech companies are also very thoughtful about making a move into wealth management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINPLN-0000016a-4bc9-dcc3-ad7f-6fcd82370000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINPLN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-PD61-F06X-W328-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

But ethical questions have quickly become very real.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rico Malvar, Microsoft's chief scientist, leaves no room for doubt about the importance of artificial intelligence to the tech giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's almost like electricity,\" he says during a session at the Microsoft Research facility at he company's sprawling campus in Redmond, outside Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But where many think of AI as creating machines that can think and even feel for themselves, the Microsoft view is that AI needs to be included - or in Microsoft speak, \"infused\" - in everything, from a simple word processor to a quantum computer.</p><p>It is, in a way, AI writ small.</p><p>While Microsoft is working on its share of AI moonshots - perhaps most notably an AI-powered project that is trying to develop a universal blood test that would screen for a huge range of diseases - the company's focus on enterprise and personal productivity that has been set by chief executive Satya Nadella means the company is pushing AI right down to its standard consumer products too.</p><p>Recent advances</p><p>So users of slide-show maker Powerpoint can, for example, connect to the cloud, sketch out their slide with an electronic pen and then choose from several suggestions as to how their slides could be set out.</p><p>Then, when they give their presentation, they can provide a real-time transcription in their native language, or display subtitles and deliver audio in another language.</p><p>Microsoft Word users can tap into a cloud-based text editor that learns their writing style. And Excel users can have huge tables of data automatically analysed, such that outliers and anomalies are instantly found.</p><p>It might not be world-changing, but Malvar emphasises two points.</p><p>Firstly, while we are already taking some of these applications almost for granted, the technology behind them has only reached human-like levels very recently.</p><p>For example, it was only in 2016 that a computer was able to achieve the same accuracy as human in recognising images. A year later, a machine was able to recognise speech with a human-like error rate. In 2018, AI matched a human's accuracy in reading comprehension.</p><p>Democratising AI</p><p>Secondly, Microsoft is now, in Malvar's words, \"democratising\" AI, by putting applications such as speech recognition, chat bots and machine learning, in the hands of developers who do not need deep knowledge of AI to implement these technologies.</p><p>In addition, according to strategic policy adviser Dave Heiner, the improvements in Microsoft's AI technologies - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/microsofts-chatbot-push-packed-with-emotion-20181028-h176pb\">the way its chatbots get smarter as they perform more tasks, for example</url> - are shared with customers, and not kept for Microsoft's benefit.</p><p>But Heiner, who worked as Microsoft's chief competition lawyer for many years as regulators battled the company over anti-trust matters, says Microsoft is also determined to tackle the many ethical problems that AI may create.</p><p>\"It's another major technological shift that will bring a whole new set of issues. And we feel we need to get ready for that,\" he says.</p><p>Aside from the desire to democratise its AI technologies, Microsoft insists a central design philosophy is to develop these technologies such that they augment humans, not replace them.</p><p>\"It's like a carpenter with a hammer,\" he says.</p><p>Aiding not replacing humans</p><p>Malvar provides the example of AI that can look at radiology scans, and, for example measure the size of tumours.

And Excel users can have huge tables of data automatically analysed, such that outliers and anomalies are instantly found.</p><p>It might not be world-changing, but Malvar emphasises two points.</p><p>Firstly, while we are already taking some of these applications almost for granted, the technology behind them has reached human-like levels only very recently.</p><p>For example, it was only in 2016 that a computer was able to achieve the same accuracy as human in recognising images. A year later, a machine was able to recognise speech with a human-like error rate. In 2018, AI matched a human's accuracy in reading comprehension.</p><p>Secondly, Microsoft is now, in Malvar's words, \"democratising\" AI, by putting applications such as speech recognition, chat bots and machine learning, in the hands of developers who do not need deep knowledge of AI to implement these technologies.</p><p>In addition, according to strategic policy adviser Dave Heiner, the improvements in Microsoft's AI technologies - the way its chatbots get smarter as they perform more tasks, for example - are shared with customers, and not kept for Microsoft's benefit. But Heiner, who worked as Microsoft's chief competition lawyer for many years as regulators battled the company over anti-trust matters, says Microsoft is also determined to tackle the many ethical problems that AI may create. \"It's another major technological shift that will bring a whole new set of issues. And we feel we need to get ready for that,\" he says.</p><p>Aside from the desire to democratise its AI technologies, Microsoft insists a central design philosophy is to develop these technologies such that they augment humans, not replace them.</p><p>\"It's like a carpenter with a hammer,\" he says.</p><p>Malvar provides the example of AI that can look at radiology scans, and, for example measure the size of tumours. This doesn't replace the role of the human radiologist, but frees them up to do better work.</p><p>\"You can have the radiologist performing a deeper analysis, and you can have a shorter session.\"</p><p>But Heiner does concede Microsoft is a platform company, so it will develop various types of technologies, and other companies will take them in different directions.</p><p>The question is, how much control can and should Microsoft have over how its technologies are used?</p><p>The use of facial recognition software, for example, has become particularly vexed, due to its use in law enforcement. Microsoft employees have questioned whether the company should be involved in providing its technology for these uses.</p><p>Heiner says it's a fascinating question, but points out there are some dangers in big tech companies acting as a sort of judge and jury on who should be able to develop what technology in which way. \"The challenge with that is that is then you have a handful of corporate entities making those decisions for the world.\"</p><p>Microsoft and other tech companies, who typically resist regulation, have taken the unusual step of calling for governments to step in with some sort of legal framework.</p><p>\"It's not obvious how you might resolve, say, pursuing safety through law enforcement, and privacy. It's not really for Microsoft to decide those kinds of questions,\" Heiner says.</p><p>In the meantime though, Microsoft will need to tackle big ethical question on its own, and it is working to create internal standards around ethical questions such as fairness (are AI systems being built with biases) and transparency (do the users of AI, and particularly those affected by its decisions, understand the basis of those decisions). An ethics committee known as Aether is helping to guide Microsoft's approach, and create guiding principles that the company can use until more governments create firmer rules. Heiner won't give examples, but he says the committee has already shaped Microsoft's approach to projects. \"We have turned down work overseas, we've turned down work in the US, where we've just felt it's not the right thing.\"</p><p>The author travelled as a guest of Microsoft</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc72mr734vfutmkrvhka</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TN9-K781-JD34-V05F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the buzz around AI now is louder and shriller than ever. With the computing power of machines increasing exponentially and staggering amounts of data available, AI seems to be on the brink of revolutionizing various industries and, indeed, the way we lead our lives.

India Today magazine named him among the top 50 most powerful Indians in 2017. Sikka is now working on his next venture exploring the breakthroughs that AI can bring and ways in which AI can help elevate humanity.  Sikka says he is passionate about building technology that amplifies human potential. He expects that the current wave of AI will 'produce a tremendous number of applications and have a huge impact.' He also believes that this 'hype cycle will die' and 'make way for a more thoughtful, broader approach.'  In a conversation with Knowledge@Wharton, Sikka, who describes himself as a 'lifelong student of AI,' discusses the current hype around AI, the bottlenecks it faces, and other nuances.  Knowledge@Wharton: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for more than 60 years. Why has interest in the field picked up in the last few years? Vishal Sikka: I have been a lifelong student of AI. I met [AI pioneer and cognitive scientist] Marvin Minsky[1] when I was about 20 years old. I've been studying this field ever since. I did my Ph.D. in AI. John McCarthy[2], the father of AI, was the head of my qualifying exam committee. The field of AI goes back to 1956 when John, Marvin, Allen Newell[3], Herbert Simon[4] and a few others organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth. John came up with the name 'AI' and Marvin gave its first definition. Over the first 50 years, there were hills and valleys in the AI journey. The progress was multifaceted. It was multidimensional. Marvin wrote a wonderful book in 1986 called The Society of Mind. What has happened in the last 10 years, especially since 2012, is that there has been a tremendous interest in one particular set of techniques. These are based on what are called 'deep neural networks.' Neural networks themselves have been around for a long time. In fact, Marvin's thesis was on a part of neural networks in the early 1950s. But in the last 20 years or so, these neural network-based techniques have become extraordinarily popular and powerful for a couple of reasons. First, if I can step back for a second, the idea of neural networks is that you create a network that resembles the human or the biological neural networks. This idea has been around for more than 70 years. However, in 1986 a breakthrough happened thanks to a professor in Canada, Geoff Hinton[5]. His technique of backpropagation (a supervised learning method used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights and the biases of each neuron) created a lot of excitement, and a great book, Parallel Distributed Processing, by David Rumelhart and James McClelland, together with Hinton, moved the field of neural net-related 'connectionist' AI forward. But still, back then, AI was quite multifaceted. Second, in the last five years, one of Hinton's groups invented a technique called 'deep learning' or 'deep neural networks.' There isn't anything particularly deep about it other than the fact that the networks have many layers, and they are massive. This has happened because of two things. One, computers have become extraordinarily powerful. With Moore's law, every two years, more or less, we have seen doubling of price performance in computing. Those effects are becoming dramatic and much more visible now. Computers today are tens of thousands of times more powerful than they were when I first worked on neural networks in the early 1990s. 'The hype we see around AI today will pass and make way for a more thoughtful and realistic approach.' The second thing is that big cloud companies like Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Baidu and others have massive amounts of data, absolutely staggering amounts of data, that they can use to train neural networks. The combination of deep learning, together with these two phenomena, has created this new hype cycle, this new interest in AI. But AI has seen many hype cycles over the last six decades. This time around, there is a lot of excitement, but the progress is still very narrow and asymmetric. It's not multifaceted. My feeling is that this hype cycle will produce great applications and have a big impact and wonderful things will be done. But this hype cycle will die and a few years later another hype cycle will come along, and then we'll have more breakthroughs around broader kinds of AI and more general approaches. The hype we see around AI today will pass and make way for a more thoughtful and realistic approach. Knowledge@Wharton: What do you see as the most significant breakthroughs in AI? How far along are we in AI development? Sikka: If you look at the success of deep neural networks or of reinforcement learning, we have produced some amazing applications. My friend [and computer science professor] Stuart Russell[6] characterizes these as 'one-second tasks.' These are tasks that people can perform in one second. For instance, identifying a cat in an image, checking if there's an obstacle on the road, confirming if the information in a credit or loan application is correct, and so on. With the advances in techniques \u2014 the neural network-based techniques, the reinforcement learning techniques \u2014 as well as the advances in computing and the availability of large amounts of data, computers can already do many one-second tasks better than people. We get alarmed by this because AI systems are superseding human behavior even in sophisticated jobs like radiology or legal \u2014 jobs that we typically associate with large amounts of human training. But I don't see it as alarming at all. It will have an impact in different ways on the workforce, but I see that as a kind of great awakening. But, to answer your question, we already have the ability to apply these techniques and build applications where a system can learn to conduct tasks in a well-defined domain. When you think about the enterprise in the business world, these applications will have tremendous impact and value. Knowledge@Wharton: In one of your talks, you referred to new ways that fraud could be detected by using AI. Could you explain that? Sikka: You find fraud by connecting the dots across many dimensions. Already we can build systems that can identify fraud far better than people by themselves can. Depending on the risk tolerance of the enterprise, these systems can either assist senior people whose judgment ultimately prevails, or, the systems just take over the task. Either way, fraud detection is a great example of the kinds of things that we can do with reinforcement learning, with deep neural networks, and so on. Another example is anything that requires visual identification. For instance, looking at pictures and identifying damages, or identifying intrusions. In the medical domain, it could be looking at radiology, looking at skin cancer identifications, things like that. There are some amazing examples of systems that have done way better than people at many of these tasks. Other examples include security surveillance, or analyzing damage for insurance companies, or conducting specific tasks like processing loans, job applications or account openings. All these are areas where we can apply these techniques. Of course, these applications still have to be built. We are in the early stages of building these kinds of applications, but the technology is already there, in these narrow domains, to have a great impact. Knowledge@Wharton: What do you expect will be the most significant trends in AI technology and fundamental research in the next 10 years? What will drive these developments? Sikka: It is human nature to continue what has worked, so lots of money is flowing into ongoing aspects of AI. From chips, in addition to NVidia, Intel, Qualcomm etc., Google, Huawei and others are building their own AI processors and many startups are as well, and all this is becoming available in cloud platforms. There is tons of work happening in incrementally advancing the core software technologies that sit on top of this infrastructure, like TensorFlow, Caffe, etc., which are still in the early stages of maturity. And this will of course continue. But beyond this, my sense is that there are going to be three different fronts of development. One will be in building applications of these technologies. There is going to be a massive set of opportunities around bringing different applications in different domains to the businesses and to consumers, to help improve things. We are still woefully early on this front. That is going to be one big thing that will happen in the next five to 10 years. We will see applications in all kinds of areas, and there will be application-oriented breakthroughs. 'The development of AI is asymmetric.' Two, from a technology perspective, there will be a realization that while the technology that we have currently is exciting, there is still a long way to go in building more sophisticated behavior, building more general behavior. We are nowhere close to building what Marvin [Minsky] called the 'society of mind.' In 1991, he said in a paper that these symbolic techniques will come together with the connectionist techniques, and we would see the benefits of both. That has not happened yet. John [McCarthy] used to say that machine learning systems should understand the reality behind the appearance, not just the appearance. I expect that more general kinds of techniques will be developed and we will see progress towards more ensemble approaches, broader, more resilient, more general-purpose approaches. My own Ph.D. thesis was along these lines, on integrating many specialists/narrow experts into a symbolic general-purpose reasoning system. I am thinking about and working on these ideas and am very excited about it. The third area \u2014 and I wish that there is more progress on this front \u2014 is a broader awareness, broader education around AI. I see that as a tremendous challenge facing us. The development of AI is asymmetric. A few companies have disproportionate access to data and to the AI experts. There is just a massive amount of hype, myth and noise around AI. We need to broaden the base, to bring the awareness of AI and the awareness of technology to large numbers of people. This is a problem of scaling the educational infrastructure. Knowledge@Wharton: Picking up on what you said about AI development being asymmetric, which industries do you think are best positioned for AI adoption over the next decade? Sikka: Manufacturing is an obvious example because of the great advances in robotics, in advancing how robots perceive their environments, reason about these, and affect increasingly finer control over it. There is going to be a great amount of progress in anything that involves transportation, though I don't think we are still close to autonomy in driving because there are some structural problems that have to be solved. Health care is going to be transformed because of AI, both the practice of health care as well as the quality of health care, the way we build medicines, protein-binding is a great case for deep learning, personalize medicines, personalization of care, and so on. There will be tremendous improvement in financial services, where in addition to AI, decentralized/p2p technologies like blockchain will have a huge impact. Education, as an industry, will go through another round of significant change. There are many industries that will go through a massive transformation because of AI. In any business there will be areas where AI will help to renew the existing business, improve efficiency, improve productivity, dramatically improve agility and the speed at which we can conduct our business, connect the dots, and so forth. But there will also be opportunities around completely new breakthrough technologies that are possible because of these applications \u2014 things that we currently can't foresee. The point about asymmetry is a broader issue; the fact that a relatively small number of companies have access to the relatively small talent of people and to massive amounts of data and computing, and therefore, development of AI is very disproportionate. I think that is something that needs to be addressed seriously. Knowledge@Wharton: How do you address that? Education is one way, of course. Beyond that, is there anything else that can be done? Sikka: I find it extraordinary that in the traditional industries, for example in construction, you can walk into any building and see the plans of that building, see how the building is constructed and what the structure is like. If there is a problem, if something goes wrong in a building, we know exactly how to diagnose it, how to identify what went wrong. It's the same with airplanes, with cars, with most complex systems. 'The compartmentalization of data and broader access to it has to be fixed.' But when it comes to AI, when it comes to software systems, we are woefully behind. I find it astounding that we have extremely critical and extremely important services in our lives where we seem to be okay with not being able to tell what happened when the service fails or betrays our trust in some way. This is something that has to be fixed. The compartmentalization of data and broader access to it has to be fixed. This is something that the government will have to step in and address. The European governments are further ahead on this than other countries. I was surprised to see that the EU's decision on demanding explainability of AI systems has seen some resistance, including here in the valley. I think it behooves us to improve the state of the art, develop better technologies, more articulate technologies, and even look back on history to see work that has already been done, to see how we can build explainable and articulate AI, make technology work together with people, to share contexts and information between machines and people, to enable a great synthesis, and not impenetrable black boxes. But the point on accessibility goes beyond this. There simply aren't enough people who know these techniques. China's Tencent sponsored some research recently which showed that there are basically some 300,000 machine learning engineers worldwide, whereas millions are needed. And how are we addressing this? Of course there is good work going on in online education and classes on Udacity, Coursera, and others. My friend [Udacity co-founder] Sebastian Thrun started a wonderful class on autonomous driving that has thousands of students. But it is not nearly enough. And so the big tech companies are building 'AutoML' tools, or machine learning for machine learning, to make the underlying techniques more accessible. But we have to see that in doing so, we don't make them even more opaque to people. Simplifying the use of systems should lead to more tinkering, more making and experimentation. Marvin [Minsky] used to say that we don't really learn something until we've learnt it in more than one way. I think we need to do much more on both making the technology easier to access, so more people have access to it, and we demystify it, but also in making the systems built with these technologies more articulate and more transparent. Knowledge@Wharton: What do you believe are some of the biggest bottlenecks hampering the growth of AI, and in what fields do you expect there will be breakthroughs? Sikka: As I mentioned earlier, research and availability of talent is still quite lopsided. But there is another way in which the current state of AI is lopsided or bottlenecked. If you look at the way our brains are constructed, they are highly resilient. We are not only fraud identification machines. We are not only obstacle detection and avoidance machines. We are much broader machines. I can have this conversation with you while also driving a car and thinking about what I have to do next and whether I'm feeling thirsty or not, and so forth. This requires certain fundamental breakthroughs that still have not been happened. The state of AI today is such that there is a gold rush around a particular set of techniques. We need to develop some of the more broad-based, more general techniques as well, more ensemble techniques, which bring in reasoning, articulation, etc. For example, if you go to Google or [Amazon's virtual assistant] Alexa or any one of these services out there and ask them, 'How tall was the President of the United States when Barack Obama was born?' None of these services can answer this, even though they all know the answers to the three underlying questions. But a 5-year-old can. The basic ability to explicitly reason about things is an area where tremendous work has been done for the last many decades, but it seems largely lost on the AI research today. There are some signs that this area is developing, but it is still very early. There is a lot more work that needs to be done. I, myself, am working on some of these fundamental problems. Knowledge@Wharton: You talked about the disproportionate and lopsided nature of resource allocation. Which sectors of AI are getting the most investment today? How do you expect that to evolve over the next decade? What do traditional industries need to do to exploit these trends and adapt to transformation? Sikka: There's a lot of interest in autonomous driving. There is also a lot of interest in health care. Enterprise AI should start to pick up. So there are several areas of interest but they are quite lumpy and clustered in a few areas. It reminds me of the parable of the guy who lost his keys in the dark and looks for them underneath a lamp because that's where the light was. But I don't want to make light of what is happening. There are a large number of very serious people also working in these areas, but generally it is quite lopsided. From an investment point of view, it is all around automating and simplifying and improving existing processes. There are a few developments around bringing AI to completely new things, or doing things in new ways, breakthrough ways, but there is a disproportionate usage of AI for efficiency improvements and automation of existing businesses and we need to do more on the human-AI experience, of AI amplifying people's work. 'There simply aren't enough people who know these techniques.' If you look at companies like Uber or Didi [China's ride-sharing service] or Apple and Google, they are aware of what is going on with their consumers more or less in real time. For instance, Didi knows every meter of every car ride done by every consumer in real time. It's the same with Uber and in China, even in physical retail as I mentioned earlier, Alibaba is showing that real-time connection to customers and integration of physical and digital experiences can be done very well. But in the traditional world, in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry or in banking, telecom or retail, where customer contact is necessary, businesses are quite disconnected from what the true end-user is doing. It is not real time. It is not large-scale. Typically, CPG companies still analyze data that is several months old. Some CPG companies still get DVDs from behavioral aggregators three months later. I think an awareness of that [lag] is building in businesses. Many of my friends who are CEOs of large companies in the CPG world, in banking, pharmaceuticals and telecom, are trying to now embrace new technology platforms that bring these next generation technologies to life. But beyond embracing technology, and deploying a few next-generation applications, my sense is, the traditional companies really need to think of themselves as technology companies. My wife Vandana started and built up the Infosys Foundation in the U.S., and her main passion is computer science education. [She left the foundation in 2017.] She found this amazing statistic that in the dark ages some 6% of the world's population could read and write, but if you think about computing as the new literacy, today some half a percent of the world's population can program a computer. We are finally approaching 90% literacy in the world, and of course we are not all writers or poets or journalists, but we all know how to write and to read, and it has to be the same way with computing and digital technologies, and especially now with AI, which is as big a shift for us as computing itself. So businesses need to reorient themselves from 'I am an X company,' to 'I am a technology company that happens to be in X.' Because if we don't, we may be vulnerable to a tech company that better sees and executes and scales on that X, as we have already seen in many industries. The iPhone wasn't so much as a phone, as it is a computer in the shape of a phone. The Apple Watch isn't a watch, but a computer, a smart computing service, in the shape of a watch. The Tesla is not so much an electric car, but rather a computer, an intelligent, connected, computing service, in the shape of a car. So if you are simply making your car an electric one, this is not enough. 'The iPhone isn't so much a phone as it is a computer in the shape of a phone.' Too often companies don't transform, and they become irrelevant. They may not die immediately. Indeed large, successful, complex structures often outlive us humans, and die long slow deaths, but they lose their relevance to the new very quickly. Transformations are difficult. One has to let go of the past, of what we have known, and embrace something completely new, alien to us. As my friend and teacher [renowned computer scientist] Alan Kay said, 'We only make progress by going differently than we believe.' And of course we have to do this as individuals as well. We have to continually learn and renew our skills, our perspectives on the world. Knowledge@Wharton: How should companies measure the return on investment (ROI) in AI? Should they think about these investments in the same way as other IT investments or is there a difference? Sikka: First of all, it is good that we are applying AI to things where we already know the ROI. I was talking to a friend recently, and he said, 'In this particular part of my business, I have 50,000 people. I could do this work with one-fourth the people, at even better efficiency.' In such a situation, the ROI is clear. In financial services, one area that has become exciting is active trading of asset management. People have started applying AI here. One hedge fund wrote about the remarkable results it got by applying AI. A start-up in China does the entire management of investments through AI. There are no people involved and the company delivers breakthrough results. So, that's one way. Applying AI to areas where the ROI is clear, where we know how much better the process can become, how much cheaper, how much faster, how much better throughput, how much more accurate, and so on. But again this is all based on the known, the past. We have to think beyond that, more broadly than that. We have to think about AI as becoming an augmentation for every one of our decisions, every one of the questions that we ask, and have that fed by data and analyzed in real time. Instead of doing generalizations or approximations, we must insist on AI amplifying all of our decisions. We must bring AI to areas where we don't yet have ROIs clearly identified or clearly understood. We must build ROIs on the fly. Knowledge@Wharton: How does investment in AI in the U.S. compare with China and other parts of the world? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. and Chinese approaches to AI development? Sikka: I'm very impressed by how China is approaching this. It is a national priority for the country. The government is very serious about broad-based AI development, skill development and building AI applications. They have defined clear goals in terms of the size of the economy, the number of people, and the leadership position. They actively recruit [AI experts]. The big Chinese technology companies are [attracting] U.S.-based, Chinese-origin scientists, researchers and experts who are moving back there. In many ways, they are the leaders already in building applications of AI technology, and are doing leading work in technology as well. When you think about AI technology or research, the U.S. and many European universities and countries are still ahead. But in terms of large-scale applications of AI, I would argue that China is already ahead of everybody else in the world. The sophistication of their applications, the scale, the complex conditions in which they apply these, is simply extraordinary. Another dimension of that is the adoption. The adoption of AI technology and modern technology in China, especially in rural areas, is staggering. Knowledge@Wharton: Could you give a couple of examples of what impressed you most? Sikka: Look at the payments space \u2014 at Alipay, WeChat Pay or other forms of payments from companies like Ping An Insurance, as well as Alibaba and Tencent. It's amazing. Shops in rural China don't take cash. They don't take credit cards. They only do payments on WeChat Pay or on Alipay or others like that. You don't see this anywhere else in the world at nearly the same scale. Bike rentals are another example. In the past year, there has been an extraordinary development in China around bicycles. When you walk into a Chinese city, you see tens of thousands of bicycles across the landscape \u2014 yellow ones, orange ones, blue ones. When you look at these bicycles, you think, 'This is a smart bicycle.' It is another example of an intelligent, connected computing service in the shape of a bicycle. You just have to wave your phone at it with your Baidu account or your Alibaba account or something like that and you can ride the bike. It has GPS. It is fully connected. It has all kinds of sensors inside it. When you get to your destination, you can leave the bike there and carry on with whatever you need to do. Already in the last nine months, this has had a huge impact on traffic. 'The adoption of AI technology and modern technology in China, especially in rural areas, is staggering.' If you walk into any of Alibaba's Hema supermarkets in Beijing and Shanghai, I think they have around 20 of these already, teeming with people, they are far ahead of any retail experiences we see today in the US, including at Whole Foods. The entire store is integrated into mobile experiences, so you can wave your phone at any product on the shelf and get a complete online experience. There is no checkout, the whole experience is on mobile and automated, although there are lots of folks there to help customers. The store is also a warehouse, in fact it serves some 70% of demand from local online customers, and fulfills that demand in less than an hour. My friend ordered a live fish from the store for dinner and it, that particular fish that he had picked on his phone, was delivered 39 minutes later. Tencent has now invested in a supermarket company. And JD has its own stores. So this is rapidly evolving. It would be wonderful to see convenience like this in every supermarket around the world in the next few years. A more recent example is battery chargers. All across China, there are little kiosks with chargers inside. You can open the kiosk by waving your phone at it, pick up a charger, charge your phone for a couple of hours, and then drop it off at another kiosk wherever you are. What I find impressive is not that somebody came up with the idea of sharing based on connected phone chargers, but how rapidly the idea has been adopted in the country and how quickly the landscape has adapted itself to assimilate this new idea. The rate at which the generation [of ideas] happens, gets diffused into the society, matures and becomes a part of the fabric is astounding. I don't think people outside of China appreciate the magnitude of what is going on. When you walk around Shenzhen, you can see the incredible advances in manufacturing, electronic device manufacturing, drones and things like that. I was there a few weeks ago. I saw a drone that is smaller than the tip of your finger. At the same time, I saw a demo of a swarm of a thousand or so drones which can carry massive loads collectively. So it is quite impressive how broadly the advance of AI is being embraced in China. 'The act of innovating is the act of seeing something that is not there.' At the other end of the spectrum, I would say that in Europe, especially in Germany, the government is much more rigorous and thoughtful about the implications of these technologies. From a broader, regulatory and governmental perspective, they seem to be doing a wonderful job. Henning Kagermann, who used to be my boss at SAP for many years, recently shared with me a report from the ethics commission on automated and connected driving. The thoughtfulness and the rigor with which they are thinking about this is worth emulating. Many countries, especially the U.S., will be well served to embrace those ideas. Knowledge@Wharton: How does the approach of companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon towards AI differ from that of Chinese companies like Alibaba, Baidu, or Tencent? Sikka: I think there is a lot of similarity, and the similarities outweigh the differences. And of course, they're all connected with each other. Tencent and Baidu both have advanced labs in Silicon Valley. And so does Alibaba. JD, which is a large e-commerce company in China, recently announced a partnership around AI with Stanford. There's a lot of sharing and also competitive aspects within these companies. There are some differences. The U.S. companies are interested in certain U.S.-specific or more international aspects of things. The Chinese companies focus a lot on the domestic market within China. In many ways, the Chinese market offers challenges and circumstances that are even more sophisticated than the ones in the U.S. But I wouldn't say that there is anything particularly different between these companies. If you look at Amazon and Microsoft and Google, their advances, when it comes to bringing their platforms to the enterprise, are further ahead than the Chinese companies. Alibaba and Tencent have both announced ambitions to bring their platform to the enterprise. I would say that in this regard, the U.S. companies are further ahead. But otherwise, they are all doing extraordinary work. The bigger issue in my mind is the gap between all of them and the rest of the companies. Knowledge@Wharton: Where does India stand in all of this? India has quite a lot of strengths in the IT area, and because of demonetization there has been a strong push towards digitization. Do you see India playing any significant role here? Sikka: India is at a critical juncture, a unique juncture. If you look at it from the perspective of the big U.S. companies or the big Chinese companies, India is by far their largest market. We have a massive population and a relatively large amount of wealth. So, there is a lot of interest in all these companies, and consequently their countries, towards India and developing the market there. If that happens, then of course the companies will benefit. But it's also a loss of opportunity for India to do its own development through educating its workforce on these areas. One of the largest populations that could be affected by the impact of AI in the near-term is going to be in India. The impact of automation in the IT services world, or broadly in the services world, will be huge from an employment perspective. If you look at the growth that is happening everywhere, especially in India, some people call it 'jobless growth.' It's not jobless. It's that companies grow their revenues disproportionately compared to the growth in the number of employees. 'Finding the problem, identifying the innovation \u2014 that will be the human frontier.' There is a gap that is emerging in the employment world. Unless we fix the education problem it's going to have a huge impact on the workforce. Some of this is already happening. One of the things I used to find astounding in Bangalore was that a lot of people with engineering degrees do freelance jobs like driving Uber and Ola cabs. And yet we have tremendous potential. The value of education is central to us in India, and we have a large, young, generation of highly inspired youngsters ready to embrace and shape the future, who are increasingly entrepreneurial in their outlook. So we have to build on foundations like the 'India stack,' we have to build our own technological strengths, from research and core technology to applications and services. And a redoubling of the focus on education, on training massive numbers of people on technologies of the future, is absolutely critical. So, in India, we are at this critical juncture, where on one hand there is a massive opportunity to show a great way forward, and help AI be a great amplifier for our creativity, imagination, productivity, indeed for our humanity. On the other hand, if we don't do these things, we could be victims of these disruptions. Knowledge@Wharton: How should countries reform their education programs to prepare young people for a future shift by AI? Sikka: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has talked about this a lot. He is passionate about this idea of job creators, not just job seekers, and about a broad culture of entrepreneurship. I'm an optimist. I'm an entrepreneur. I like to see the opportunity in what we have, even though there are some serious issues when it comes to the future of the workforce. My own sense is that in the time of AI, the right way forward for us is to become more evolved, more enlightened, more aware, more educated, and to unleash our imagination, to unleash our creativity. John McCarthy was a great teacher in my life. He used to say that articulating a problem is half its solution. I believe that in our lifetime, certainly in our children's lifetime, we will see AI technology advance to the point where any task, any activity, any job, any work that can be precisely formulated and precisely articulated, will be done automatically, far better than we can do with our senses and our muscles. However, articulating the problem, finding the problem, identifying the innovation \u2014 that will be the human frontier. It is the act of seeing something that is not there. The act of exercising our creativity. And then, using AI to become a great amplifier, to help us achieve our imagination, our vision. I think that is the great calling of our time. That is my great calling. Five or six hundred million years ago, there was this unusual event that happened geologically. It was called the Cambrian explosion. It was the greatest creation of life in the history of our planet. Before that, the Earth was basically covered by water. Land had started to emerge, and oxygen had started to emerge. Life, as it existed at that point, was very primitive. People wondered, 'How did the Cambrian explosion happen? How did all these different life forms show up in a relatively small period of time?' What happened was that the availability of oxygen, the availability of land, and the availability of light as a provider of life, as a provider of living, created a situation which formed all these species that had the ability to see. They all came out of the dark, out of the water, onto the land, into the air, where opportunities were much more plentiful, where they could all grow, they could all thrive. People wonder, 'What were they looking for?' It turns out they were looking for light. The Cambrian explosion was about all these species looking for light. When I think about the future, about the time in front of us, I see another Cambrian explosion. The act of innovating is the act of seeing something that is not there. Our eyes are programmed by nature to see what is there. We are not programmed to see what is not there. But when you think about innovation, when you think about making something new, everything that has ever been innovated was somebody seeing something that was not there. I think the act of seeing something that is not there is in all of us. We can all be trained to see what is not there. It is not only a Steve Jobs or a Mark Zuckerberg or a Thomas Edison or an Albert Einstein who can see something that is not there. I think we can all see some things that are not there. To Vandana's statistic, we should strive to see a billion entrepreneurs out there. A billion-plus computer literate people who can work with, even build, systems that use AI techniques, and who can switch their perspective from making a living to making a life. When I was at Infosys, we trained 150,000 people on design thinking for this reason: To get people to become innovators. In our lifetime, all the mechanical, mechanizable, repeatable things are going to be done way better by machines. Therefore, the great frontier for us will be to innovate, to find things that are not there. I think that will be a new kind of Cambrian explosion. If we don't do that, humanity will probably end. Paul MacCready, one of my heroes and a pioneer in aerospace engineering, once said that if we don't become creative, a silicon life form will likely succeed us. I believe that it is in us to refer back to our spirituality, to refer back to our creativity, our imagination, and to have AI amplify that. I think this is what Marvin [Minsky] and John [McCarthy] were after and it behooves us to transcend the technology. And we can do that. It is going to be tough. It is going to require a lot of work. But it can be done. As I look at the future, I am personally extremely excited about doing something in that area, something that fundamentally improves the world.

At least until the very end of his second term, President Obama often acted like technology companies could do no wrong. Remember \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://openmarketsinstitute.org/?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Why+Al+Franken%27s+Speech+Aimed+at+Tech+Companies+Could+Signal+Good+News+For+the+Music+Industry\">South by South Lawn</url>\"? Now, suddenly -- and without much nuance -- technology companies are getting blamed for everything from sex trafficking to the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p/><p/><p/><p>This shift in the political winds could help the music business, which is now excited about a copyright reform process that it once regarded with some dread. To get a sense of the potential consequences, think of Franken's speech and do a Google search for \"music.\" The first result is YouTube, which is a very popular destination for music; the second is \"GooglePlay Music,\" which... isn't. Then, after displaying \"top stories,\" GooglePlay's music service also comes up as the third and fourth results. Spotify, the most popular streaming service after YouTube, doesn't make the first page of results. A search for \"download <url normalizedValue=\"http://openmarketsinstitute.org/?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Why+Al+Franken%27s+Speech+Aimed+at+Tech+Companies+Could+Signal+Good+News+For+the+Music+Industry\">Taylor Swift</url>Reputation\" brings up several dubious-looking MP3 sites, including one that features links to \"single Slavic women,\" but not Swift's album. (Googlesearch results can change based on the content and popularity of various sites, as well as tweaks to the company's algorithm.) The only download stores that show up on the first page of results are Amazon and Apple -- but only in ads.</p><p/><p>Does that mean Google's search engine is unfairly biased toward the company's other businesses? It's hard to say, since it discloses very little about how its search algorithm actually works. (YouTube did not respond to requests for comment.) It's also important to note that this may not be as big a deal as it seems: If Googleis using its search engine to draw music fans to its GooglePlay music service, it's not going very well. But the ability of platforms to steer users has all sorts of implications. </p><p/><p>Months ago, Spotify was accused of promoting \"fake artists\" to which it could pay a lower royalty rate, which the company says it doesn't do. Lyor Cohen, YouTube's global head of music, <url normalizedValue=\"http://openmarketsinstitute.org/?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Why+Al+Franken%27s+Speech+Aimed+at+Tech+Companies+Could+Signal+Good+News+For+the+Music+Industry\">has said</url>that \"80 percent of all of watch time is recommended by YouTube\" -- presumably to maximize viewer engagement. But YouTube could also recommend content owned by certain companies.</p><p/><p/><p/><p>For almost two decades, there wasn't much interest in regulating technology companies -- especially when it came to their interactions with the media companies they framed as old and in the way. Politicians, especially centrist Democrats, saw companies like Facebook and Googleas sources of solutions, not problems. Now Silicon Valley is playing defense, and those companies are going to have to make some difficult decisions about how much regulation they can live with. In early November, the Internet Association, which represents technology companies, <url normalizedValue=\"http://openmarketsinstitute.org/?utm_source=LexisNexus&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Why+Al+Franken%27s+Speech+Aimed+at+Tech+Companies+Could+Signal+Good+News+For+the+Music+Industry\">issued a statement in support of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act</url>(SESTA), which would impose some liability on them. Activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation objected to this compromise -- which could be the first of several cracks in the anti-copyright coalition.</p><p/><p>Technology lobbyists also have bigger problems than anything that involves the music business. For years, their three main issues were net neutrality, copyright and immigration -- which could all be framed as moral causes. Now, just as all of these are heating up -- Trump's FCC wants to undo net neutrality, copyright legislation is being proposed and immigration is getting America First-ed -- other problems have emerged.

It's not that simple, of course: Restaurants and radio stations still want to pay as little as possible for music.

The changes are being announced in emails, blog posts and new on-screen messages that many consumers are already beginning to see from Apple, Twitter, Airbnb, GoDaddy and others. Facebook users will receive new privacy prompts in the coming weeks. Don't bother thanking Washington, which remains mired in gridlock despite rising public concerns about data privacy. </p><p>Rather the changes emanate from the European Union, which is imposing a host of new regulations that are forcing global changes, including for hundreds of millions tech consumers in the United States. Privacy advocates warn that these changes won't fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and tech companies, many of which make their profits by collecting data on users, building individual profiles and selling advertising based on the resulting troves of data. \"I don't know that these companies are making radical differences in what they're doing,\" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union. But the changes do mark a rare shift toward greater user control and transparency as companies scramble to comply with the European regulations. Those that fail to do so could face fines of up to 4 percent of global profits. The new laws, known as GDPR, for General Data Protection Regulation, take effect May 25 in the European Union. They require that tech companies use plain language to explain how their data will be used and that users give explicit consent for these uses. As companies create new ways of using data, they must ask again for permission. Under GDPR, users also are gaining new rights to download their data and move it to other platforms. And there are new restrictions on data collection on users under the age of 16, unless parents or guardians consent. Companies are not required to apply these same regulations outside the European Union. Some, such as Twitter, said they will implement privacy rules differently in the United States and Europe. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, announced this week that it was raising the minimum user age to 16 in Europe but leaving it at 13 for users in the rest of the world, including the United States. Many others, however, are choosing to adopt a single global standard because of the logistical challenges of maintaining two sets of privacy regimes and also to avoid the potential political and public-relations backlash for giving protections to one set of consumers and not others. Companies say there may be minor variations between privacy standards in the E.U. and the U.S. but not to a degree most users would notice. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, during congressional testimony this month, said his company would apply the European standards to U.S. users. A company blog post later elaborated, \"Everyone \u2014 no matter where they live \u2014 will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook.\" Facebook users in the United States are scheduled in coming weeks to see a series of new consent screens explaining how the company collects and uses personal data and asking permission for these uses. There will be questions specifically seeking consent for facial recognition technology, which Facebook for years has employed to identify people in photos uploaded to the platform. (The technology will be new, however, in the European Union and Canada, and people there will be asked to consent to its use for the first time.) Google says that it too is applying the same privacy standards globally across its many online services, though, as with Facebook, there may be minor variations in how these standards are applied. Apple, which relies less on the collection of personal data than some other big tech companies, last month added new privacy protections in updates of its operating systems to comply with GDPR. Those updates applied to users worldwide, the company said, and created new alerts to signal when Apple collects user data. The company also is allowing all users to request their data, seek corrections and demand that any account be deleted. One outlier is Twitter, which said that it is adopting a single, unified privacy policy for users throughout the world but implementing it differently outside of Europe, meaning users in the United States will see different explanations and requests for consent. \"Our first priority is to meet the EU requirements to comply with GDPR on May 25th,\" the company said in a statement. \"People around the world use our service in different ways and therefore how we present features must be customized by region.\" The uneven responses among the companies are frustrating privacy advocates, who argue that the arrival of GDPR offers an opportunity for fundamental change \u2014 beyond just a series of new explanations and consent boxes that users are asked to check. \"They're just trying to get away with business as usual,\" said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE - This Nov. 4, 2013, file photo, shows the icon for the Twitter app on an iPhone in San Jose, Calif.Twitter continues to find creative ways to ease its 140-character limit on tweets without officially raising it. Now, the company says that when you reply to someone, or to a group, usernames will no longer count toward those 140 characters. In the fall of 2016, Twitter said it would stop counting photos, videos, quote tweets, polls and GIF animations toward the character limit.

Facebook users will receive new privacy prompts in the coming weeks.</p><p>Don't bother thanking Washington, which remains mired in gridlock despite rising public concerns about data privacy. Rather the changes emanate from the European Union, which is imposing a host of new regulations that are forcing global changes, including for hundreds of millions of tech consumers in the United States.</p><p>Privacy advocates warn that these changes won't fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and tech companies, many of which make their profits by collecting data on users, building individual profiles and selling advertising based on the resulting troves of data.</p><p>\"I don't know that these companies are making radical differences in what they're doing,\" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union.</p><p>But the changes do mark a rare shift toward greater user control and transparency as companies scramble to comply with the European regulations. Those that fail to do so could face fines of up to 4 percent of global profits.</p><p>The new laws, known as GDPR, for General Data Protection Regulation, take effect May 25 in the European Union. They require that tech companies use plain language to explain how their data will be used and that users give explicit consent for these uses. As companies create new ways of using data, they must ask again for permission.</p><p>Under GDPR, users also are gaining new rights to download their data and move it to other platforms. And there are new restrictions on data collection on users\u00a0younger than 16, unless parents or guardians consent.</p><p>Companies are not required to apply these same regulations outside the European Union. Some, such as Twitter, said they will implement privacy rules differently in the United States and Europe. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, announced this week that it was raising the minimum user age to 16 in Europe but leaving it at 13 for users in the rest of the world, including the United States.</p><p>Many others, however, are choosing to\u00a0adopt a single global standard\u00a0because of the logistical challenges of maintaining two sets of privacy regimes and also to avoid the potential political and public-relations backlash for giving protections to one set of consumers and not others. Companies say there may be minor variations between privacy standards in the\u00a0European Union and\u00a0United States but not to a degree most users would notice.</p><p>          Facebook chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg,</nameText></person>\u00a0during congressional testimony this month, said his company would apply the European standards to U.S. users. A company blog post later elaborated, \"Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook.\"</p><p>          Facebook users in the United States are scheduled in coming weeks to see a series of new consent screens explaining how the company collects and uses personal data and asking permission for these uses.</p><p>There will be questions specifically seeking consent for facial recognition technology, which Facebook for years has employed to identify people in photos uploaded to the platform. (The technology will be new, however, in the European Union and Canada, and people there will be asked to consent to its use for the first time.)</p><p>Google says that it, too, is applying the same privacy standards globally across its many online services, although as with Facebook there may be minor variations in how these standards are applied.</p><p>Apple, which relies less on the collection of personal data than some other big tech companies, last month added new privacy protections in updates of its operating systems to comply with GDPR. Those updates applied to users worldwide, the company said, and created new\u00a0alerts\u00a0to signal when Apple collects user data. The company also is allowing all users to request their data, seek corrections and demand that any account be deleted.</p><p>One outlier is Twitter, which said that it is adopting a single, unified privacy policy for users throughout the world but implementing it differently outside of Europe, meaning users in the United States will see different explanations and requests for consent.</p><p>\"Our first priority is to meet the E.U. requirements to comply with GDPR on May 25th,\" the company said in a statement. \"People around the world use our service in different ways and therefore how we present features must be customized by region.\"</p><p>The uneven responses among the companies are frustrating privacy advocates, who argue that the arrival of GDPR offers an opportunity for fundamental change - beyond just a series of new explanations and consent boxes that users are asked to check.</p><p>\"They're just trying to get away with business as usual,\" said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

But it also pressed Washington on other matters\u00a0including computer cloud services, cybersecurity and welfare benefits.</p><p>The\u00a0increased lobbying spending is just one sign of Amazon's\u00a0interest in courting the nation's capital. In the fall of 2014, the company\u00a0moved its Washington policy shop to a much larger office space. Last spring, Amazon picked up Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary.</p><p>\"Like a lot of businesses, Amazon has a presence in Washington and we focus on issues that matter to us,\" said Carney, now Amazon senior vice president for global corporate affairs.</p><p>Amazon has long lobbied for the creation of a national standard for collecting state sales tax for online purchases, a change that would simplify their business practices.</p><p>In a recent town hall meeting with Washington Post employees, Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos -- who also owns The Post -- cited state sales taxes as the lobbying issue he has been personally most engaged on. But so far, legislation at the heart of that change has been unsuccessful -- much to Bezos' chagrin.</p><p>\"It's even a bipartisan issue that both side agree on and we still can't get it done,\" he said. \"It's very puzzling to me as an outsider, I don't know how you guys live here, honestly.\"</p><p>But Amazon's fastest growing sector, Amazon Web Services, is far from an outsider in Washington. While most people probably know Amazon as an online retailer, its cloud computing segment is fast becoming a key pillar of its business. The subsidiary -- which lets\u00a0customers\u00a0use\u00a0Amazon's Web-based servers for their computing needs\u00a0--\u00a0has deals with big tech firms such as\u00a0Netflix and Airbnb -- as well as\u00a0some parts of the federal government.</p><p>\"They are the primary cloud infrastructure provider to government,\" said Lydia Leong, a distinguished analyst and vice president focused on information technologies at research firm Gartner.</p><p>The company's cloud segment has done business with an alphabet soup of agencies including, NASA, HHS, and DOJ.\u00a0Even then, the full scope of Amazon's business relationship with the government is hard to track because there are more than a dozen resellers that agencies can also use to purchase its services.\u00a0But one government agreement stands out: In 2013, Amazon was awarded a contract worth up to $600 million by the CIA to build and maintain a cloud system for America's intelligence agencies -- over the objections of IBM, which had offered to do the job for a lower price.</p><p>\"The fact that AWS has had some success in its business with the public sector, and obviously with the CIA, speaks to the quality of what AWS has and offers,\"\u00a0said Carney.</p><p>It's unclear how significant government contracting\u00a0is to AWS's overall growth: The cloud services division had 70% year on year sales growth for a total operating income of $1.86 billion in 2015, according to the company's latest SEC filing. The cloud segment also has much thicker margins than other parts of the business, and could soon eclipse profits from North American retail operations if it keeps growing at the same rate.</p><p>But the recent SEC filing did warn that the company faces risks related to \"government contracts and related procurement regulations.\"\u00a0And last year, the company also retained the lobbying services of Richard Beutel, who previously served a senior staffer for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and was the original author of the last major law reforming federal IT policy.\u00a0Beutel left the government in January of 2015. By April, his new firm was registered to lobbying on behalf of Amazon Web Services -- engaging \"with policymakers regarding cloud acquisition and deployment,\" according to one disclosure.</p><p>Bringing in people who have deep ties to the government contracting process like Beutel shows that Amazon's efforts to woo the government are maturing. But Leong said they're still playing catch up with their major competition in the cloud IT space, Microsoft, who has a longer history in government contracting.</p><p>\"They do not have as many relationships -- and we know that government contracting involves a lot of relationships. Microsoft, for instance, has very deep relationships on the federal and state level -- they understand how this works,\" said Leong.\u00a0\"Amazon is really having to learn how to navigate all these things,\" she said.</p><p>The lobbying disclosures do not break down how much Amazon spent on each of the issues listed on the forms. And the company did not elaborate on which issues primarily drove the increase. But on some matters, such as drones, Amazon has made its interests clear.</p><p>Amazon dreams of delivering packages to customers doorsteps via unmanned aircraft, even though the proposed rules by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial drone use wouldn't allow\u00a0for the type of flights the company\u00a0hopes to make.</p><p>\"The FAA has a tough job -- so I think we can acknowledge that right away,\" Bezos said when asked about his experience working with the agency at the town hall. \"What's happening with drones is going to cause a lot of new rules to be written, and they're going to have to be done very carefully.\"</p><p>While Bezos said the agency has \"very good intentions,\" he also argued their approach perhaps\u00a0may be\u00a0a little \"backward.\"</p><p>The FAA is \"a little strangely hamstrung\u00a0because they have very little control over hobbyist drones and complete control over commercial drones,\" Bezos said. A company like Amazon, he argued, can bring a higher \"level of care and rigor\" to its drone projects than most hobbyists.</p><p>The FAA has been slower than some of the other jurisdictions where Amazon is also experimenting, Bezos said, citing \"forward thinking\" approaches in Canada, the U.K. and the Netherlands.</p><p>\"There are a number of jurisdictions where I suspect we'll see parcel delivery by drone first,\" he said.</p><p>              Alice Crites and Tom Hamburger contributed reporting for this story.           </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ff792beaccee4801b988b1a3a443b961</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J16-SC01-JB4M-V1HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1066\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 5, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

(NASDAQ: AMZN) has become noticeably more concerned with what politicians say about it. In the last two weeks, one of the company's primary Twitter accounts has twice shot back at two well-known Democrats after they made statements questioning how much the company pays its workers and in taxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Combined with tweets made by well-known Amazon executives this year, the company is challenging rhetoric coming from left-leaning senators, House members and presidential hopefuls. It's a noticeably different stance compared to Amazon's reticence to respond when President Donald Trump launched a tweet storm last year against the company, CEO Jeff Bezos and the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The contrasting responses could be a sign of how serious Amazon takes comments coming from these politicians compared to those from the president. Some of these politicians have called to break up the company, which could impact its long-term growth and its promised second headquarters, a 15-year, $4 billion investment in Greater Washington.</p><p>A source familiar with Amazon's thinking said the company won't allow comments it considers incorrect from well-known politicians go unchallenged because it can cause harm in the long run.</p><p>\"Amazon will correct the record when high-profile candidates and elected officials make statements about the company that are either incorrect or misleading,\" the person said. \"They know first hand that errors and misunderstandings become accepted truths if not set straight.\"</p><p>While Trump is a high-profile official, the need to dispute his tweets is less essential, according to the source. \"The media has done a good job on fact checking his factual inaccuracies so the need is not as demanding as other inaccuracies,\" the person said.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this story.</p><p>The most recent response from Amazon came after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. - a vocal nemesis of Amazon's eventually nixed HQ2 plan in Long Island City, Queens - appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez was asked if under a \"true progressive platform,\" would Bezos, Amazon's founder and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-richest-man-after-divorce-2019-4\">the richest human in the world</url>, remain a billionaire in five or 10 years? Whether or not Bezos is a billionaire was only important, the congresswoman responded, if by being so it prevented workers at Amazon fulfillment centers from earning a \"living wage.\"</p><p>\"If his being a billionaire is predicated on him paying people starvation wages and stripping them of their ability to access health care, and also if his ability to be a billionaire is predicated on the fact that his workers takes food stamps, so I'm paying for him to be a billionaire.\"</p><p>One of Amazon's several Twitter accounts, @AmazonNews, responded:</p><p>Even Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon and former former White House press secretary, did not let Ocasio-Cortez's comments go unquestioned.</p><p>The face of the New York HQ2 resistance wasn't finished. Responding to Amazon, Ocasio-Cortez <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/AOC/status/1140782374264954880\">pointed to a news reports</url> that suggested a significant portion of the company's low-wage workers were on \"food stamps.\" This isn't the first time the congresswoman has questioned working conditions in Amazon warehouses, and Carney isn't the only one to tweet a response. The day after the company pulled out of Long Island City, Ocasio-Cortez described fulfillment center work as \"dehumanizing.\" And Dave Clark, Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations, said that was not correct and invited her to tour one.</p><p>Conditions in Amazon warehouses could be a particularly sensitive topic for the company. Bezos praised the company's $15 minimum wage and challenged competitors to match or out do it <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/04/11/jeff-bezos-challenges-worlds-largest-retailers-to.html\">in an annual letter to shareholders released in April</url>. That hasn't stopped criticism that Bezos could do better. Amazon workers near Minneapolis filed a federal discrimination complaint       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2019/05/09/3-muslim-workers-at-amazon-file-federal.html\">accusing the company of creating a hostile environment</url> for Muslim workers last month.</p><p>For a while now, politicians have argued the company doesn't pay enough in taxes. The most recent presidential hopeful to comment was former Vice President Joseph Biden, who tweeted he had \"nothing against Amazon,\" but it should pay a higher tax rate.</p><p>The company responded by saying it paid billions in corporate taxes:</p><p>Criticism from another Democratic presidential hopeful, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has been more pointed and a potentially bigger threat to Amazon. She argued that - by running the online marketplace and collecting data on buyers - Amazon could turn around and sell popular products on its platform at a cheaper price, essentially hurting smaller businesses. Warren made this argument during a CNN town hall, and later tweeted it out in April.</p><p>The next day, Amazon responded to this tweet calling Warren's claims false.</p><p>Warren's beef with Amazon doesn't end with its website. One of Warren's many plans introduced this election cycle is to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/03/08/elizabeth-warren-proposes-breaking-up-tech-giants.html\">break up big tech companies, like Amazon</url>. The company, along with other tech giants, are building up their lobbying efforts to head off potential antitrust regulation, according to reporting in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/amazon-apple-facebook-google-lobbying.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email\">The New York Times</url>. Amazon spent $14 million in lobbying last year, a steady increase over the the three years prior according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The company has always tried to control the narrative in all of its ventures, including its hunt for HQ2. When the search was narrowing down, Mike Grella, a former director of Economic development and policy at Amazon, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/11/03/amazon-mike-grella-hq2-leaker-crystal-city-va.html\">warned leakers to keep their mouth shut during the nationwide search</url> in a tweet. It also deployed top lobbyist Brian Huseman, vice president, Public Policy at Amazon and former Federal Trade Commission official, to sit right beside Holly Sullivan, head of worldwide economic development, when       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/03/16/it-was-long-it-was-disruptive-but-arlington-just.html\">they took questions from the Arlington County Board during the incentive deal approval process</url>. The company was also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/05/02/special-report-how-arlington-went-out-of-its-way.html\">involved with messaging</url> during the weeks leading to that vote.</p><p>It gets a little harder to find Amazon tweets responding to politicians before this year. The most notable came in summer 2018 after Sen. Bernie Sanders claimed \"the American people are subsidizing Amazon workers' food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world. It's time to get Mr. Bezos off of welfare.\"</p><p>This led to a couple of tweets from Amazon and <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/response-to-senator-sanders/\">a blog post</url> claiming Sanders was repeating \"inaccurate and misleading accusations against Amazon.\"</p><p>But perhaps more notable than what Amazon has said on social media is what it did not say when the president went after the company.</p><p>In March 2018, the president tweeted multiple times claiming Amazon was taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service, sellers on its platform and not paying enough in taxes - the same critiques made recently by Democrats. The company did not respond then, but it is doing so now.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?
