But this simply isn't enough to keep pace with the workload landing on its doorstep.</p><p>Consider what Dixon has on her plate: \u00f7 The world's biggest (and most controversial) data-slurping tech companies, which keep getting bigger and adding more services; \u00f7 Hundreds of small and middle-tier data-slurping companies, newly settling in Ireland to follow the giants; \u00f7 Government departments and semistate companies with public service cards and corner-cutting practices; \u00f7 Banks, insurance firms and credit unions; \u00f7 Garden-variety hacks and data breaches in \"ordinary\" society.</p><p>And then there are the momentous geopolitical court rulings, such as the Schrems judgment a fortnight ago: to her endless list of tasks, the DPC must now add the duty of telling Facebook, Google and thousands of other businesses that their data transfers to the US may no longer be allowed.</p><p>All of this occurred to me when, last week, I rang the DPC to ask what its position was on the huge Twitter hack the week before. Would this kick off anything much? The polite answer was that a data breach notification from Twitter was received, but that's about all that was happening.</p><p>I understood. There simply aren't people to just drop some of the hundreds (or thousands) of other tasks it's currently at for a mid-level hack that may only have exposed the personal information of a handful of celebrities.</p><p>This whole situation causes tension with European neighbours. Many EU countries already give out about Ireland's tech-friendly, low tax industrial set-up. Not only do we take all the big rich tech firms, they moan, but then we don't apparently resource the regulatory end of things quickly enough.</p><p>Politically, this is levelled at the Government as an indication of cynical soft-touch regulation.</p><p>It's a point that privacy campaigner Max Schrems made again recently, before last week's momentous European Court judgment that struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield treaty.</p><p>\"Soon after the GDPR came into force it became obvious that the DPC is acting as a bottleneck for Europeans' right to privacy,\" he said.</p><p>\"The procedure is Kafkaesque and seems to be almost designed to delay user complaints for years and thereby protect US multinationals that are headquartered in Ireland.\"</p><p>Schrems is sometimes given to a bit of drama. As one would expect, his reasoning has always been strongly rejected by the Irish DPC's office as well as successive governments.</p><p>And yet Schrems, the one who filed the initial complaints in Dublin about Facebook's transfer of his data to the US, is not alone in this view. Some rival data protection authorities whisper similar things.</p><p>Schrems, too, has a right to be taken seriously on the specific question of delay. There is a valid question over due process and resource constraints leading to a system that frustrates the timely vindication of rights.</p><p>It takes years for some of the important complaints and data breach investigations to be fully processed by the DPC. In Schrems's own Facebook case, much of it has been down to legal uncertainty over who should call the shots on making such a massive call on the suspension of data flows between the US and the EU. No-one can blame the DPC here for seeking ECJ cover: that is a treaty-shattering, geopolitical call.</p><p>But since the GDPR came into force over two years ago, the DPC has amassed well over 20 investigations into giant tech multinationals (around half of them involving Facebook). None has been completed. Just one, into a Twitter data breach, is in its final Article 60 consultation process with other European data protection authorities.</p><p>When it comes to the pace of DPC decisions on big tech, it's fair to say that it is taking a long time.</p><p>Dixon makes valid points in defence of this. First, very few of the other European data protection authorities are especially more advanced in major cross-border investigations.</p><p>Second, if you rush decisions, like her British counterpart has done at least once, you leave it open to even longer delays because of inevitable, complex appeals. (At least one major multinational privacy chief told me privately that his company would be less likely to appeal an Irish DPC judgment if it's \"thorough\" and involved proper consultation. Because much of this is new legal ground, high-powered company lawyers are less likely to quickly accept a ruling and pay up unless they feel they've been walked through every last step.) Third, it's not easy to expand a serious regulatory agency quickly. This isn't a start-up.</p><p>But even with all of these reasonable points, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that Ireland's data protection authority simply needs more staff. They're too thinly resourced. The volume of work they're facing is getting bigger and bigger. People's expectations of their privacy rights being vindicated, both here and across Europe, are getting deeper.</p><p>We need to make a statement that shows EU neighbours we understand the future scale of our responsibilities. Otherwise, we may continue to find ourselves the butt of snarky comments about \"soft regulation\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems.

The US has a bottom-up, industry-led regulatory philosophy, while most of Europe has a top-down, government-led approach.</p><p>From Australia to Ireland, most countries with a history of having the British around generally approach regulation the way the US does. And with all its faults, it is difficult to argue this regulatory philosophy has not created space to build the world's most innovative and dynamic companies. Regulators and politicians across most Irish political parties have a natural advantage when dealing with US companies over their continental European counterparts: they look at regulation as a team sport. With the UK out of the EU, there are no other governments in Europe who will approach big tech companies in a way the companies understand, much less in a way they will accept without a fight.</p><p>While the continent struggles to create effective legislation, or struggles to enforce messy legislation it already created (looking at you GDPR), Ireland stands leagues ahead.</p><p>France launched the initial tax salvo against US tech companies last year, and quickly and quietly relented when the US threatened 100pc retaliatory tariffs on French wine and cheese, among other goods.</p><p>In the meantime, the disarray has led to competing proposals by national EU governments and Brussels. As efforts to unify behind a single proposal galvanise, and the Trump administration dials up the tariff rhetoric, it's natural for Dublin to try to stay out of it. That would be a mistake. Instead of worrying about being caught in the middle, the Irish Government could be shaping the rules of engagement.</p><p>Europe will need Ireland as much as Ireland needs the politicos in Brussels to be effective in this pending tax fight. And if Dublin plays its cards right, it could use the opportunity to redirect much-needed revenue to the cash-starved Data Protection Commission in the process.</p><p>They like me, they really like me American companies may have come to Ireland initially for favourable tax treatment, but they have stayed for the excellent base of talent, our strong and stable institutions and legal environment. And, with the UK out of the EU, where else would they go? Perhaps a few would go off to Luxembourg or to the Nether-lands, but many would no doubt stay in Ireland.</p><p>Americans like doing business in Ireland because it feels a lot like doing business at home. And this is what makes the country a singular place to build a lasting bridge between American business innovation and European values.</p><p>Sometimes it's tough to appreciate how much goodwill the Irish have abroad. In the US, 91pc of Americans believe that it is important or very important to keep a good relationship with Ireland.</p><p>And it isn't just talk.

Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo, PayPal, Cisco Systems, Dropbox and Microsoft all have massive operations in Dublin.<br/>Apple, for example, has been in Ireland for 30 years. The U.S. tech powerhouse keeps 70% of its profits under the umbrella of its Irish subsidiary. With loopholes under Irish law, Apple pays almost nothing in taxes. Recent tech upstarts like Airbnb, the accommodation rentals website, are also heading to the city on the mouth of the River Liffey.<br/> But for a tech company in the European Union, this means facing a completely different attitude towards personal and online privacy than in the United States.<br/> Specifically, the European Union adopts a far stricter approach to privacy than the U.S.<br/> For example, in May 2014, a man in Spain sued Google, demanding the removal of a link to an article about an auction to his foreclosed home. The\u00a0European Court of Justice\u00a0ruled in favor of the man, establishing a digital 'right to be forgotten.' And a determined pro-privacy campaign launched by\u00a0an Austrian law student has produced two comprehensive EU audits\u00a0of Facebook, alleging massive violations of EU citizens' right to online privacy.<br/> But here's the kicker: the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has authority over any tech company based in Ireland. That makes the Commissioner the first port of call for anyone in Europe unhappy with the privacy practices of U.S. firms based there, like Google, Apple, or Microsoft. As Daraugh O'Brien, an Irish data protection expert in Dublin, put it: 'Ireland's data protection watchdog has found itself responsible for protecting the data of a large part of the world's population.'<br/> But the Commissioner has a habit of making calls in favor of American tech firms \u2014 perhaps reflecting the importance of the sector to Ireland. For example, the most recent Commissioner, Billy Hawkes, approved the transfer of reams of private data from Apple and Facebook servers in Europe to the United States, despite worries that U.S. law-enforcement agencies might get their hands on it. In this instance, issues of digital privacy[2] seemed to take a backseat to the desires of the American companies.<br/> The Irish Commissioner's role will become even more important once the European Union finalizes\u00a0new privacy rules\u00a0next year, including restrictions on what information can be transferred out of the EU. The proposed regulations are strict, threatening fines of up to 5% of a company's global revenue in the event of privacy violations.<br/> But under the proposals, tech companies will be able to operate throughout the EU if they fulfill the interpretation of EU rules under the privacy authority of the country where they are based. That means if the privacy practices of a Dublin-based tech firm like Amazon or Googlesatisfy the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, they automatically pass muster with the entire EU, whether the rest of the EU likes it or not.<br/>Obscure Foreign Bureaucratic Battle Affects Millions \u2014 Including You<br/>For this reason, the process of choosing a new Irish Data Protection Commissioner recently became a global issue. A five-person panel of Irish civil servants and privacy experts was selected to pick the new regulator, out of more than 30 applicants. The candidate they selected, Helen Dixon[3], has spent over a decade working for two U.S. IT multinationals with their European, Middle Eastearn and African bases in, you guessed it, Ireland.<br/> Big tech firms are pulling out all the stops to ensure that this\u00a0new Commissioner continues Ireland's lax oversight. Meanwhile, EU leaders and privacy advocates like Germany's <person><nameText>Angela Merkel </nameText></person>are piling in on the other side, demanding a much stricter approach.<br/> The stakes are high indeed. Roughly 80% of Facebook's 1.2 billion users are outside North America. Facebook's Dublin headquarters is legally responsible for adhering to EU rules regarding the privacy of every single one of them. And since it isn't really feasible to have one set of systems for the U.S. and another for the rest of the world, the EU standards imposed upon Facebook and other tech companies will have a profound impact on their U.S. operations as well.<br/> The last time I checked, I didn't have the right to vote in Ireland. But it's clear that my privacy is being\u00a0affected by decisions made by the Irish government. The same has long been true, of course, for citizens of many other countries when it comes to actions by the U.S. government. As Marshall McLuhan put it years ago, we live in a global village.<br/>Your Personal Battle for Internet Privacy<br/>Here's the lesson I draw from this: big institutions around the world, public and private alike, are increasingly beyond our influence. Decisions made far away by bureaucracies with which we have no relationship are shaping our lives in profound ways. Whether the Irish government interprets EU privacy rules by Commissioner, act of parliament, or plebiscite, the reality is that we don't have control over the matter, even though it affects us.<br/> That means that it's up to each of us to protect our own interests. When it comes to privacy, be a parliament of one. Establish personal and financial privacy and regain sovereign control[4] over your own affairs.<br/> It can be done. And we're here to help.<br/> Kind regards,<br/><br/>Ted Baumann<br/>Offshore and Asset Protection Editor<br/> The post Ireland: The Country that Sets Big Tech's Internet Privacy Policies[5] appeared first on The Sovereign Investor[6].<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/11/26/what-attracts-big-tech-companies-to-ireland-hint-its-not-just-low-taxes/\">http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/11/26/what-attracts-big-tech-companies-to-ireland-hint-its-not-just-low-taxes/</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thesovereigninvestor.com/asset-protection/is-google-policing-the-internet/\">http://thesovereigninvestor.com/asset-protection/is-google-policing-the-internet/</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/helen-dixon-appointed-as-data-protection-commissioner-1.1924161\">http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/helen-dixon-appointed-as-data-protection-commissioner-1.1924161</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thesovereigninvestor.com/asset-protection/leading-a-sovereign-lifestyle/\">http://thesovereigninvestor.com/asset-protection/leading-a-sovereign-lifestyle/</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thesovereigninvestor.com/asset-protection/ireland-sets-big-tech-internet-privacy-policies/\">http://thesovereigninvestor.com/asset-protection/ireland-sets-big-tech-internet-privacy-policies/</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thesovereigninvestor.com\">http://thesovereigninvestor.com</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-RSMN11383614103892641650081062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSMN-113836</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D48-5CY1-F03R-N4F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1111\"/><timeReceived>10:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sovereign Investor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 10, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The preliminary order, the people said, was sent by Ireland's Data Protection Commission to Facebook late last month, asking for the company's response. It's the first significant step EU regulators have taken to enforce a July ruling about data transfers from the bloc's top court. That ruling restricted how companies like Facebook can send personal information about Europeans to U.S. soil, because it found that Europeans have no effective way to challenge American government surveillance.    To comply with Ireland's preliminary order, Facebook would likely have to re-engineer its service to silo off most data it collects from European users, or stop serving them entirely, at least temporarily. If it fails to comply with an order, Ireland's data commission has the power to fine Facebook up to 4% of its annual revenue, or $2.8 billion.    Nick Clegg, Facebook's top policy and communications executive, confirmed that Ireland's privacy regulator has suggested, as part of an inquiry, that Facebook can no longer in practice conduct EU-U.S. data transfers using a widely used type of contract.    \"A lack of safe, secure and legal international data transfers would damage the economy and prevent the emergence of data-driven businesses from the EU, just as we seek a recovery from Covid-19,\" Mr. Clegg said.    Ireland's Data Protection Commission declined to comment.    The preliminary order is a victory for European privacy activists, who have been arguing before regulators and in court for the better part of a decade that their data shouldn't be sent to or kept in the U.S. because it could be turned over to the government under secret requests.    It is also a warning for big tech companies with operations in Europe, and for the trans-Atlantic trade they facilitate. Though the order applies to Facebook, the company may be the first in the queue in front of other U.S.-based tech companies to face similar orders, one of the people familiar with the matter said. At stake is whether the U.S. might have to change its surveillance laws for data transfers to resume, the person added.    Blocking big tech companies' data transfers to the U.S. could upend billions of dollars of trade from cross-border data activities, including cloud services, human resources and marketing, because they involve accessing or storing information about Europeans from U.S. soil, tech advocates say. Similar logic could also be used to block transfers to other countries with surveillance laws deemed invasive by EU courts, advocates add.    To be sure, Ireland's order is preliminary and could be revised before it is finalized, a process that could take several months. Ireland's data commission leads EU privacy enforcement for Facebook because it has its regional headquarters in the country, but Ireland's privacy regulator must coordinate with counterparts in other EU countries in cross-border cases.    Ireland's data commission has given Facebook until mid-September to respond to the order, the people familiar with the matter said. After considering Facebook's responses, the data commission told the company it plans to send a new draft of the order to the 26 privacy regulators in other EU countries for joint approval under a cooperation provision of the bloc's privacy law, the people added.    Facebook could also potentially challenge the order in court. Internally, Facebook considers the preliminary order and its future implications a big deal, one of the people said. Because of its sensitivity, the existence of the order is being held closely inside Facebook while executives and lawyers determine how to respond, that person and another person familiar with the matter said.    Since the July ruling, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, and U.S. officials have started negotiations to establish a new way for companies to send data on Europeans to the U.S. that would comply with the court's requirements. But \"there will be no quick fix,\" EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said in European Parliament last week.    Some privacy lawyers have said that the U.S. would need to change its surveillance laws to address the court's concerns. The U.S. for its part has said that its surveillance practices are proportionate, and in court argued that the EU shouldn't exercise jurisdiction over U.S. national security practices.    The focus now is on EU's privacy regulators to see how they enforce the July ruling. A board representing EU privacy regulators last week announced a task force to tackle the topic. Ireland's data commission has been closely watched because, in addition to Facebook, it also leads EU privacy enforcement for several big tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc.    Ireland's plan to order Facebook to stop sending data to the U.S. -- even if only preliminary -- marks a major shift in more than two decades of wrangling between the EU and U.S. over how to balance privacy and commerce when it comes to trans-Atlantic data flows. In 2015, the EU's top court invalidated a major legal mechanism for transferring such information to the U.S. But the threat ended up being mostly theoretical: No company actually faced a specific order to stop sending personal information, and the data flows never stopped.    At issue is a basic precept of EU privacy law dating back to the 1990s. It is illegal for a company to send personal information about EU residents to another part of the world that doesn't offer essentially equivalent privacy protections to the EU -- except in certain circumscribed circumstances. The U.S., which doesn't have a national data-privacy law but rather more sector specific regulations in some areas, such as health care, didn't make the EU cut.    To keep data flowing, the U.S. and EU in the late 1990s negotiated a special system, called Safe Harbor, where companies sending European data to the U.S. could opt into EU-style rules, enforced by the U.S. government. Companies also had other options to send data overseas, such as using preapproved EU contractual language, called standard contractual clauses, in which companies promise to uphold European privacy standards.    Legal challenges to those systems began in 2013, after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked details of U.S. government surveillance practices. A privacy activist named Max Schrems argued that Safe Harbor exposed his Facebook information to the U.S. government. The EU's Court of Justice agreed, and struck down the system in 2015.    The EU and U.S. quickly worked out a replacement framework, dubbed Privacy Shield, which added some additional protections such as an ombudsperson at the U.S. State Department to field complaints from Europeans. But July's Court of Justice decision struck that system down, too, saying that the U.S. still didn't provide Europeans with actionable rights to challenge surveillance.    Businesses were initially comforted that the July decision stopped short of invalidating the so-called standard contractual clauses as well, and instead said that companies must assess whether the laws of the countries where they are sending data allow them to ensure adequate protection under EU law. Facebook was among several companies that said over the summer that they would rely on those standard contractual clauses to transfer data to the U.S., now that Privacy Shield was no longer valid.    But Ireland's sending of the preliminary order to suspend data transfers suggests that it found such standard clauses aren't sufficient under the ruling, at least in Facebook's case. If that reasoning stands, such clauses might also be ruled invalid for other large technology and telecommunications companies that, like Facebook, fall under the purview of the U.S. surveillance laws discussed in the EU court ruling, including Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.    Noyb, a privacy advocacy group founded by Mr. Schrems, used that reasoning in August when it filed privacy complaints to various EU privacy regulators against 101 European websites, using the EU court ruling to argue that they must stop sending data using U.S.-based tech providers.    The potential that Facebook and other large tech companies might have to stop sending data to the U.S. raises the stakes on efforts to come up with replacement frameworks to allow such transfers. In addition to talks with the U.S. to replace Privacy Shield with a new system, the European Commission says it is also updating the language of the standard contractual clauses. But it isn't clear how such updates would address the court's surveillance concerns.

It goes back to this notion that if technology is going to be so pervasive in our lives and across all industries then we better have one core currency around it, which is trust.

You were a very good cricketer, or spin bowler actually, for those in the room who love cricket. Can you talk about how someone who was studying electrical engineering decided to uproot yourself and go to the United States. What was behind that?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Satya Nadella:</emphasis> Thank you so much, it's great to be back in Australia and be in Sydney. Growing up in the late '70s, in the '80s, in Hyderabad in India at that time, it was off the grid in some sense - today it's a different city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My mother was a professor of Sanskrit and my father was a Marxist-economist civil servant, and there was very little the two of them could agree on. And so they left me to my own devices and, in some sense, when I look back at that time, it made a real difference because I think it helped me find myself.</p><p>My curiosity drove me. I was able to play cricket but also find passion - in fact, Microsoft technology reached me when I was growing up. I remember very distinctly, my father worked in the UN for a little while in Thailand and then he bought a Sinclair computer when I was in 10th grade, and it changed my life. And that's how I joined electrical engineering.</p><p>I had never been west of Bombay, and I never thought I would go to west Bombay. And then I showed up in Wisconsin, and it was quite a shock, I must say. It was the month of August and it was beautiful - it was like Sydney, there was water and it was awesome. And then the winter rolled around and that was a different story.</p><p>My father loved ideas and he taught me how to be intellectually curious, and then my mother more so. And as I have become older, perhaps a little wiser, I recognise what she really taught me is about being present in what is a complicated and distracting world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer:</emphasis> How do you mean?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> I think all of us deal with that, which is we are in love with this new thing and new technology, new initiatives, and at the same time not being able to stay present means you miss life. And so that's sort of shaped a lot of what I think about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer: </emphasis>You joined Sun Microsystems and then graduated to Microsoft in 1992. Tell us about what did you when you joined the company - did you think that there would be this great future for you, or was it a stock stepping stone to another company?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella: </emphasis>I worked at Sun for a couple of years and then I was going to go to business school - that was the plan at least. And so I resigned from Sun and joined the Chicago school and had just in that interim period gotten an offer from Microsoft. But although I was still going to go full-time to business school, the boss who hired me at Microsoft convinced me that, anyway, you're going to come back from business school to a job like this - let me give that job to you now.</p><p>I always remembered the first job I had at Microsoft. I thought, this is the greatest thing that has happened to me and maybe the best thing that ever happened to me, and so I immersed myself in it - I loved it. I thought it was a privilege and that's what led me from one to the other, but definitely not a plan B.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">: </emphasis>Fortune magazine, in naming you the Business Person of the Year, said that Microsoft had a dog-eat-dog culture under Bill Gates. Is that true, and how did you find your way through that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella: </emphasis>There's so much written about Microsoft in our culture and past and present. I grew up - and as you know, it was said I'm a consummate insider - I've grown up at Microsoft. If there's anything good about Microsoft or anything bad about Microsoft, I represent it all. But growing up I felt that I had amazing mentors, amazing co-workers.</p><p>Did we have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/microsoft-says-4-day-work-week-boosted-productivity-40pc-20191106-p537ry\">a culture that needed to change</url>? Of course. Do we have a culture today that needs to change? Of course. But at the same time, as I say, I'm objective enough perhaps to be able to sort of criticise what it is that we need to get rid of without it appearing as criticism.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">: </emphasis>I want to talk about the cloud. Everybody in this room is facing disruption. And I think that the secret to your success was to recognise that Microsoft should actually put its efforts into a business that had very low margins and was already being dominated by another company, Amazon Web Services. How can people in this room use disruption as a way of changing their own company to something else?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella: </emphasis>I think it's an interesting challenge for all of us really, which is you were successful and then your own success in some sense gives you a structural headwind in what comes next. And how you overcome that is perhaps one of the bigger issues.</p><p>I'm a big student of business history institutional strength and I'm always looking for companies that have gone through those sort of meteoric rises and then they have issues - how have they come back? I mean if you have a business that was born 10 years ago and you've been growing 20 per cent every quarter and never been tested - you know, good for you, but it's nothing that I can learn from.</p><p>I want to learn from people who have gone through that curve, so to speak. And here is the one thing - you know, to your point about how you recognise the cloud.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the person I give all the credit to is [former CEO] Steve Ballmer because, after all, he gave me the cloud job - he took on the risk as CEO, saying \"go all in\".</p><p>The one thing I realised more so as CEO is [that] we as leaders will have to take on the risk, because you can't go to the organisation and say, \"Hey, here's a new business that has got a margin profile that is much lower than the margin profile you enjoy, but I think we should be all in on it.\" You just don't go tell one of your direct reports, as a CEO, \"You should get fired if you don't succeed.\"</p><p>And also, you're going to have a batting average. Not everybody's Don Bradman, but for any one of us who are mere mortals, as long as you have an about 50 average and you're a good businessperson - and to me that was the goal. And <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/how-satya-nadella-added-850b-to-microsoft-20191114-p53ajl\">we missed mobile, but we're not going to miss cloud</url>. Let's just go make that count.</p><p>Device platforms will come and go but the one thing that won't go away is the broad computing fabric that stitches all of this together.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer: </emphasis>Now a lot of companies are coming after you: Google, Apple. But before you arrived several people in the room said to me, what is the next big thing? What is going to happen over the next five to 10 years that could potentially either take this company to even greater heights, or ruin it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> I don't even frame our long-term success in those terms. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/the-1-trillion-miracle-of-microsoft-20190507-p51kr7\">What's this competition?</url> Not that we don't care, but we need to think ultimately about who is competing with us and why are we doing a better job than them for any customer. My view of the world is as follows: if every company is going to be a software company then what they need is more software capability that needs to get built inside.</p><p>Whether you're in mining, whether you're in energy, whether you're in banking - what it is doesn't matter. You all will want to build your own technology capability.</p><p>I mean, one thing to me is it's no longer possible for you to say, \"oh, here are the big tech companies, let me see which one of them has great technology\". That's actually the most irrelevant thing you could be doing.</p><p>What you need to do is to think about what is your own tech capability and who can give you the most leverage in building that tech capability. I did describe this as tech intensity, which is you want to adopt the world-class technology and build your own proprietary digital IP. Both of those are important because if you get stuck doing things which are available as a commodity out there in the marketplace, you are reinventing the wheel and that's a big waste of time and money and resource.</p><p>I envision a world where there is real broad-spread economic growth. Digital tech becomes just an ingredient of everything we do. We definitely want to be a relevant player in it but our vision is not about being the only player. If anything we want success to be much more broad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">: </emphasis>I noticed in one of your latest presentations that you describe the cloud as the computer of the world. Is it possible for one company - for example your company - to be too big, to get to a point where it is so much integrated into everything and everywhere and has so much pricing power that it is actually a harm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> I think that all of those attributes of too much pricing power or lack of competition, all of those are bad things for broader economies and broad growth. I want us to be a commodity input - we need to be able to measure our own success by people being much more successful.</p><p>There are actually two very different business models at play, and I'm not saying either one of those is good or bad, but there's a platform business model and there's an aggregate a business model. A platform I believe is only stable if the value created about the platform is more than the platform.</p><p>So to your point - if there is a lot of value being created on top of the platform, the platform will do well. And that's what we're trying to build when we say we're building the world's computer to serve the computing needs of the world very efficiently in a cost-effective way, so that others can create more value. Aggregators are different.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer: </emphasis>I've read Tools and Weapons by Brad Smith and I interviewed him as well and of course your company has really embraced additional regulation, hasn't it? You were putting through the privacy requirements of Europe automatically all around the world straight away. Is there actually in your strategy a willingness to help governments to regulate you and regulate Facebook and Google as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> That approach is to have a core principle of how to build trust in technology. It goes back to this notion that if technology is going to be so pervasive in our lives and across all industries then we better have one core currency around it, which is trust. Without trust we are not going to have a long-term business.</p><p>So therefore it's incumbent on us to first get self-government right. Who legislates the good uses and who in the end the bad uses. And I think that is what we elect our governments for, our regulators for. I think that we should use those mechanisms as appropriate, and we are okay with that</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer:</emphasis> We're running out of time so I just want to get some questions out for the investors in the room.</p><p>The total addressable market is one of those phrases that's used to describe the opportunity in front of any company. When I was in Redmond I asked that question to several people and one of them said \"unlimited\" and I wonder if you could address that because I did quote Hamish Douglass earlier in the week and he said trillions of dollars. Could you please quantify it - do you know, is it in your business plan, is the opportunity ahead of Microsoft in terms of the digitisation of everything?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> So here's how I think about the total addressable market. If you look at the world GDP, 5 per cent or so is what is considered tech spend. Just on a secular basis, so you know in the next 10 years it's going to double. So COGS [Cost of Goods Sold] to operating expenses in every industry is going to have a digital element.</p><p>And so therefore in some sense we are participating in what is a secular growth business. It doesn't mean we are not going to be subject to business cycles. If the world economy doesn't grow long term, we won't grow. But assuming that, we can continue to grow as a component of that growth. Digital is going to just be a larger and larger percentage.</p><p>But your point goes back to saying our business model, our mission and who we are in the world is dependent on broad economic growth. And if the banks in Australia or the retailers in Australia the healthcare companies in Australia the energy companies here are not successfully using digital technology, that TAM will not appear. So our TAM is dependent in some sense digital technologies reshaping the TAMs of everyone else.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer:</emphasis> So I think you are saying it's unlimited</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> It is unlimited if you believe your opportunity is unlimited.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer: </emphasis>We can't leave this topic without pointing out the two flaws in your strategy. These pre-date you. You're not in mobiles and you're not in the living room with Netflix-type products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> If I look back at our history we made our biggest mistakes when we did things out of envy. I think that companies are born with a sense of purpose. I believe we have identities as even companies like, you know, human beings and I want us to stay true to that.</p><p>I want us to go back and be proud of being that company that creates technology so that others can create more technology. When Paul and Bill started Microsoft in 1975 and said \"oh you know what the coolest thing we can do is build the basic interpreter for the Altair\" I think that was the best decision.</p><p>And just guess what? In 2019 right here in Sydney we have a lab building some of our quantum work. So then we build a quantum computer each so that quantum as a computer with Q sharp as the language can be used by people everywhere in the world to create new stuff.</p><p>And so I'm happy doing more of that. It doesn't mean others can't enjoy success of their own - we wish them well - but we would love for the next Netflix or any other competitor who is going to be an Australian media company to build on our cloud. We would in fact want to partner with them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer: </emphasis>I just wanted to read you a quote from Bill Gates. He once said, \"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10\". What technologies are we overestimating now? Obviously it's not the cloud. What are we underestimating?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella:</emphasis> It's interesting that are three layers of what I describe as the tech stack - for lack of a better phrase - that are worth thinking about broadly. The first one is about the cloud. The most exciting work happening in the cloud is happening at the edge of the cloud, and in fact right here in Australia there's a company called<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/property/australias-willow-creates-digital-twin-for-germanys-tallest-tower-20180924-h15sj3\"> Willow</url> which is basically building a digital twin for railway operations. An industry which is a core part of the industrial revolution.</p><p>What happens to that industry in a world where every kilometre of track has sensors and all of that data in real time is getting collected in a digital twin. It's then being used to change the operation of the railway and make it more efficient.</p><p>All that data is getting computed at the edge. In other words, when data is getting generated on your factory floor or in the railway track or in a mine, you're not going to rendezvous it in the cloud - you're going to bring the cloud to your site.</p><p>Now that device is a connected device. And what needs to be done in a secure way is being done at the edge device but connected to the cloud. So to me that's the ubiquity of computing. Thinking about the cloud is not about a destination but about the cloud and the edge is where I think we are going.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/why-artificial-intelligence-is-like-electricity-for-microsoft-20181102-h17fei\">Of course, AI.</url> We're far from AGI [Artifical General Intelligence] but some of the breakthroughs in AI are pretty phenomenal, especially what is unsupervised, multimodal learning. That's, I think, underestimated. Like the ability to do real breakthroughs in language, who would have thought that thoughts are just vectors?</p><p>It might be true that there is a mathematical theory that allows us to break through, even though we are very, very far from it. I'm not one of those who thinks that somehow we're around the corner, but that might be one place where we can have some surprising breakthroughs.</p><p>But the last layer I'll just mention I'm very excited about is on the experience side, which is mixed reality. To me, when the ultimate computing experience, the dream we have always had, that is what led us to HoloLens and we're excited about HoloLens 2, has been, if you can mix what is virtual and what is real, then that is the ultimate experience. You're not reaching to your pocket for a device or anything, it's just there. And to me that is absolutely happening.</p><p>In fact, if you look at even the use cases, right, of HoloLens even today, Qantas using HoloLens simulator for their training, that's sort of a very early glimpse of what the future could look like where you're not mediated by a device but the world is mediated by computing. And to me that's the type of work that I see happening.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanticleer:</emphasis> We've only got a couple of minutes left so I thought I might ask if few sort of personal questions. How do you relax - we know you're interested in cricket, but I don't suppose you're actually playing it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nadella: </emphasis>I used to always think that you do need to find that balance between what is considered relaxing versus what is working. So, the thing that in some sense reframes that equation where what I'm trying to do is harmonize what I deeply care about, my deep interests, and with my work.</p><p>That doesn't mean, like the one thing that I do try to practice is when I'm with my kids, am I really present or am I just there? That's the thing that I ask myself. And quite frankly, you know, I fail a lot but I at least ask myself that when I am trying to do something consciously with my family, am I really prioritizing it, and that sort of gives me -- when I do it well, that gives me a tremendous amount of energy and satisfaction to go back to even work.</p><p>But the other thing that also is, here I am in Australia, I care a lot about accessibility. I have my own passions. I use Microsoft as a platform. We talk about this at Microsoft a lot. Each one of us should use -- you know, there was this gentleman I worked for at Microsoft. His name is Doug Burgum. He happens to be the governor of North Dakota right now. But he used to say to me that, \"Look, Satya, you're going to spend so much time at Microsoft, but it better have deeper meaning than just being a job, because otherwise you're going to regret it.\"</p><p>And as I've grown up now 28 years in the company, I sort of look at that and say, that is what has helped me, I think, which is I don't view this as I view Microsoft as a platform for me to be able to pursue my own passions, and that gives me, to your point, a lot of meaning and that to me is the ultimate form of relaxation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520208393</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJB-1JY1-DY19-C388-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3058\"/><timeReceived>09:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The data commissioner's office said in a statement it would now \"proceed to investigate the substance of the complaint with all due diligence.\" Facebook said in a statement it had never been part of a program to give the U.S. government direct access to its servers and said it would respond to enquiries by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. The ECJ ruling has thousands of U.S. and European companies mired in legal uncertainty over the transfer of personal data from Europe to the United States. That includes payroll and human resources information as well as data used for online advertising, which is of particular importance to tech firms. Under EU data protection law, companies cannot transfer EU citizens' personal data to countries outside the bloc deemed to have insufficient privacy safeguards. A lawyer for Facebook had asked to voice the company's opinion in the Irish case, but withdrew that request when the judge said any ruling would not go into detail as to how the regulator should conduct its investigation. Schrems, who live-tweeted the ruling from the Irish court room, told journalists he expected the EU would have difficulty reaching consensus on a new framework due to disagreements between countries who want different levels of safeguards. \"In the end you will have to have a solution because it's not possible that within a European market you have different approaches,\" he said.

Its investigation into the California-based company was ordered by Ireland's High Court in October after the CJEU struck down Safe Harbour, an EU-U.S. agreement that had allowed the free transfer of data between the European Union and the United States. The CJEU ruled the agreement did not sufficiently protect Europeans' information against U.S. surveillance. Transfers of Europeans' personal information to the United States have been a hot topic since 2013 revelations about mass U.S. surveillance programmes such as Prism, which allowed U.S. authorities to harvest private information directly from big tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google. Since the CJEU ruling, companies have had to rely on model contracts and other, more cumbersome, measures to transfer Europeans' data to the United States in compliance with strict EU data privacy rules. \"Thousands of companies transfer data across borders to serve their customers and users,\" a spokeswoman for Facebook said. \"The question the Irish DPC plans to raise with the court regarding standard contract clauses will be relevant to many companies operating in Europe,\" she said, adding that Facebook has a number of legal ways of moving data to the United States. The CJEU ruling in October stemmed from a complaint by Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems. He challenged Facebook's transfers of European users' data to its American servers, citing the risk of U.S. snooping. \"We yesterday informed Mr Schrems and Facebook of our intention to seek declaratory relief in the Irish High Court and a referral to the CJEU to determine the legal status of data transfers under standard contractual clauses,\" the IDPC said. One of the reasons the ECJ struck down Safe Harbour is because the agreement did not offer EU citizens sufficient channels to complain about U.S. surveillance. Schrems and other privacy campaigners contend that alternative arrangements such as model clauses don't offer Europeans any means of redress either. \"There is no way that the CJEU can say that model contracts are valid if they killed Safe Harbor based on the existence of these U.S. surveillance laws,\" Schrems said in a statement on Wednesday. After the CJEU ruling in October, the EU Commission and the United States rushed to hash out a new data-sharing agreement, the Privacy Shield, which they are hoping to have up and running by the end of June. However, EU privacy watchdogs have raised a number of concerns about the framework, heightening fears that it might not withstand a court challenge. \"If the courts decide that the standard contractual clauses cannot be relied upon and that the transfers of personal data which they facilitate must be halted, the effect on international business would be catastrophic,\" said Oliver Yaros, a lawyer at Mayer Brown.(Reuters) Source: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessworld.ie\">www.businessworld.ie</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSWLD-3421739N</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSWLD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JVV-PRC1-JC16-9464-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Media World Ltd.

This suspension order comes off the heels of the landmark ruling from the highest court in the EU, Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland (Schrems II), which restricted the methods companies can use to transfer EU data to the US. Notably, this decision ceased the use of the widely popular 'Privacy Shield' program. </p><p>This decision was made because there is currently no way to limit US government surveillance on companies like Facebook. EU regulators want to ensure that EU data has the same protection in the US as it does in the EU. According to a Wall Street Journal article[1], Ireland's DPC sent the order late last month, asking for a response from Facebook. Privacy Officers across the World, especially the US, are closely watching the case unravel, as this is the first significant step taken by an EU regulator to enforce Schrems II. How Facebook reacts and the steps taken by Ireland could be an indication of what is to come. It seems that despite the court's ruling in Schrems II, Facebook and many other similar companies have continued transferring data from the EU to the US. To comply with an order like Ireland's preliminary order, Facebook will have to reconfigure how they process and store the data from Irish Facebook users. This could potentially place a temporary halt on Facebook services for Irish citizens and consumers all throughout the EU. Ultimately, if Facebook fails to comply, the commissioner has the power to fine Facebook up to 4% of its annual revenue. The order from the DPC also put into question the use of the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). The DPC stated they are unsure of how the current processes for data transfers could actually protect EU data from US government surveillance. More specifically, the order states that the SCCs cannot, in practice, be used for EU-US data transfers. The SCCs are a widely used mechanism for companies to transfer data from the EU under a set standard, but when the problem is whether the US government has the power to surveil certain types of data, the SCCs cannot ease those concerns. It seems that no amount of extra security measures could help US companies ease the EU's concerns because, ultimately, the question is whether the US government has the power to surveil EU consumer data. Currently, given its involvement as a party in the Schrems II decision, the DPC has only directed its order to Facebook\u2014an arguably easy and highly public target. However, other companies in the US should not take this order lightly. This should serve as a warning for companies that transfer data from the EU. Now is the time to be strategic about how EU data will be stored and processed moving forward. Not only will companies have to reconsider their approach in regards to EU data, but also, the US may have to reconsider their surveillance laws to ease the EU's concerns. If the US government does not consider another approach, it could cost big tech companies billions of dollars. This could, in turn, create a domino effect because other countries may begin to agree with the EU and question US government surveillance laws, potentially halting cloud services, marketing across borders, and employee data processing. Facebook is expected to respond to the preliminary order in mid-September. In the meantime, the Irish DPC is seeking joint approval from other privacy regulators across the EU. Many questions are left unanswered. Are the SCCs enough for companies that are not subject to FISA 702 (a US surveillance law that companies like Facebook are subject to)? Will companies have to split their data processing activities according to the location of their consumers or users? Can smaller startups survive if data transfers between the EU and the US are no longer allowed? Answering many of these questions depends on whether the US government is willing to create US laws that bridge the gap between US surveillance laws and EU privacy rights. There is no better time to create contingency plans with your privacy attorneys and officers as this situation continues to unfold.

Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms, making Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) the EU's lead regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) \"One Stop Shop\" regime introduced in 2018. The new rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4per cent of a company's global revenue or 20 million euros (17 million pounds), whichever is higher. In its annual report, the DPC said two of the 21 inquiries it had open into big tech firms by the end of 2019 had moved from the investigative stage to the decision-making phase. </p><p>They related to a 2019 investigation into a bug in Twitter's Android app, where some users' protected tweets were made public and a 2018 probe into the transparency of WhatsApp's data sharing with Facebook and its fellow subsidiaries. Facebook has come under most scrutiny since the new rules came into force in mid-2018 with eight individual probes, plus two into WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram. Twitter and Apple are subject to three inquiries each. Google , Verizon Media, Microsoft owned LinkedIn and U.S. digital advertiser Quantcast made up the rest of the cross-border investigations at the end of last year. The DPC has since launched a second inquiry into Google, relating to its processing of location data, and a first probe into the Match Group Inc's Tinder dating app. Under GDPR, the DPC must share its draft decision with all concerned EU supervisory authorities and consider their views in its final verdict. Each of the bloc's regulators may be called on for a majority decision if agreement cannot be reached among the relevant member states. A report last month showed European regulators had imposed just 114 million euros in fines for data breaches since GDPR came into force.

Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders,\" he wrote in the letter as quoted by the Guardian.\u00a0<br/> The 25-year-old whistleblower used to work as a subcontractor for Apple in its Cork offices. His job was to transcribe user requests in English and French until he left the same following ethical concerns over the work.\u00a0<br/> Le Bonniec claimed that he had listened to \"thousands of recordings\" that were made from various Apple devices including iPhones, Apple Watches, or iPads through Siri without the user activating the service.\u00a0\u00a0<br/> The system recorded a lot of data of users, their relatives and children that included names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and private conversations, Le Bonniec told the Guardian.<br/>Apple, at the request of Le Bonniec and his colleagues, had promised to change its \"grading\" programme, which enabled contractors and sub-contractors to listen in to users' recordings, and only grade recordings from users who had actively opted for the practice. However, Le Bonniec had written to authorities demanding action against the company and holding it accountable for its years-long practice without the users' knowledge.\u00a0<br/>Apple's Irish regulators have questioned the company over its practices. The DPC had said that they had probed the issue and had questioned the tech giant last summer. The company has since made some changes, Reuters reported.\u00a0<br/> The DPC will follow up with Apple again following the release of Le Bonniec's public statement, it said.\u00a0<br/> \u00a0<br/> \u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A-364916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYK-8211-JBYT-H140-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 22, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

I want to really start with Facebook, because this is what struggling (ph) down futures, ahead of the New York open. How realistic do you think it is that the folks in D.C. will actually make some kind of move on Facebook in the near term?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  I think my city is going to talk about it a fair amount. But I don't believe that's going to lead to actual action. You know, commerce has a way of moving from headline or crisis to headline or crisis. And there was some focus on social media's impact on the electoral process. At the end of last year on Capitol Hill, but as Congress also does, it simply move on.  </p><p>      So, we should expect for out of caring and some pointed commentary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Some key law makers, but as her actual legislative action, it's unlike (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  All right, so -- you're taking off legislative action with respect to the fact that 50 million people's information was expose to at analytics company that helps President Trump get elected and their information was disclose through the Facebook platform.  </p><p>      Take us behind the scenes. How much will Facebook have to spend in order to ward off any legislative action in lobbying (ph) efforts in discussions, or will it just be sort of a hot topic for a moment and everyone will move on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  I think that all of the media, freak (ph) social media firms are going to have to increase their D.C. presents over the next few years. The conversations in particularly the policy conversations around a content and -- and proper channel protection and data security and data fluidly (ph), all those things are going to continue in D.C.</p><p>      And so all of those firms are going to have to increase their presence in town, even though the likelihood of actual action --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  -- redeems well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  With the CEOs might be spending a little bit more time in Washington D.C. as well, I mention (INAUDIBLE), how long before we see the CEOs and these big tech firms just lined up in front of Congress?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  I think it something that's absolutely possible during these Congress. These are more and more as he walk the halls of the Hill concerns about the impact of social media on the election process. And with the midterms, only a few months away, I think that there's a real shot that could happen over the night few months.  </p><p>      If it's not, then it will be soon, because this topic is going to hang around Capitol Hill for the first (INAUDIBLE) future.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So certainly this was another instance playing into the bigger story of what happened in the election previously, well as Russia's involvement, what do the tech firms do? Well rather did not do. And at the same triple with that Isaac, special counsel Robert Mueller. And we seat in here try to work out, what happens next and if he gets fired, how significant would it be? Weigh in please Isaac.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Yes, look weekends at the White right, I mean we had a pretty active, we had a pretty active weekend with the dismissal of Mr. McCabe, the tweets about Mr. Mueller's investigation. You know, when you take all these things together, these actions of (INAUDIBLE) at least raise the specter (ph) of President Trump dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller.  </p><p>      Now, late last night, the way White House law -- one of the White House lawyers, accusing actually President Trump's lawyer, came out and said that there is no consideration of firing Mr. Mueller.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  If it happen --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  That is --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  -- if it happen now Isaac, I try to understand drain the politics from this, because certainly if you ask a Democrat how significant it would be that give you want to ask Republican, they give you another.  </p><p>      Drain the politics from this. It's constitutionally speaking, how significant would that be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  You know, look most of the personnel questions and volatility does come out in this White House has been again to reality TV spectacle. Dismissing Mueller would still far close to an actual viable constitutional crisis. There would be broad bipartisan rebukes from both ends, both sides of the isles and both chambers on Congress.  </p><p>      And I think that it would become the number one talking points having into the midterms. So this would have -- firing Mueller would have actual --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  -- real world tangible impact, unlike the personnel carousel that we've seen at the White House for the pass 14 months or so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  So, Isaac, something else is going to have real world impact is some of the proposals to roll back financial regulation and we have seen the recent aspect of Dodd-Frank that's getting world back that affects, particularly smaller -- banks that are in communities.  </p><p>      I'm just wondering from your perspective, has the potential regulatory roll back been price into U.S. financial stocks already.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  I think that it's coming close. And, when we look at some of these banks, especially because the -- one of the core benefits which is raising the 50 billion thresholds, is only raise to 100 billion immediately. And you have to wait another 18 months before its raise to 250 billion. And that increase ultimately, I think will be tailwind for M&amp;A which is part of the story here with community and regional banks.  </p><p>      My only point of caution is it will take time for that tailwind to fully materialize.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  When you say --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  So --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  -- M&amp;A, your talking about among community banks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Correct? OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Community banks and -- and even moving into the regional space.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  So -- in other words, you expect the regulatory roll backs to pave the way to bigger regional banks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  OK. And that hasn't been pricing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  I don't think so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Isaac, going forward, this has been bipartisan push, what are the limits of that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Well, look this bill that we've been following, that's gone out of the Senate. And is now being held up in the House, has Republican leadership wants to add more to it. This bill is the last train leaving the station for a legislative perspective. This has been eight years in the making. It's been --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  -- and further more, every single data point suggest that Democrats have a tailwind at their back heading into the midterms, especially in the House. So this bill from a legislative perspective, this is it. After this is done, we're going to have to start focusing on the alphabet soup of financial regulators the OCC, FDIC, CFBB and the others to look for rachial (ph) changes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So for us, is anyone talking about infrastructure, and I guess whistling in the wind?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  Well, we're going to get a spending bill tonight and that spending bill should see increases in some infrastructure spending program. But other than that, that's it for this Congress. There is simply no legislative will to act on broader infrastructure policy in this Congress.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Isaac Boltansky --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOLTANSKY</emphasis>:  All will get, I think we'll see tonight.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  -- always great to catch up with you. Thank you very much for joining us sir, the Compass Point, senior VP and policy analyst. Connecting the world of Washington D.C. into the world of Wall Street.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXD-BX81-F15W-H2HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

The conversations in particularly the policy conversations around a content  and -- and proper channel protection and data security and data fluidly  (ph), all those things are going to continue in D.C.</p><p>And so all of those firms are going to have to increase their presence in  town, even though the likelihood of actual action --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  -- redeems well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  With the CEOs might be spending a little  bit more time in Washington D.C. as well, I mention (INAUDIBLE), how long  before we see the CEOs and these big tech firms just lined up in front of  Congress?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I think it something that's absolutely possible during these  Congress.  These are more and more as he walk the halls of the Hill  concerns about the impact of social media on the election process.  And  with the midterms, only a few months away, I think that there's a real shot  that could happen over the night few months.</p><p>If it's not, then it will be soon, because this topic is going to hang  around Capitol Hill for the first (INAUDIBLE) future.</p><p>FERRO:  So certainly this was another instance playing into the bigger  story of what happened in the election previously, well as Russia's  involvement, what do the tech firms do?  Well rather did not do.  And at  the same triple with that Isaac, special counsel Robert Mueller.  And we  seat in here try to work out, what happens next and if he gets fired, how  significant would it be?  Weigh in please Isaac.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Yes, look weekends at the White right, I mean we had a pretty  active, we had a pretty active weekend with the dismissal of Mr. McCabe,  the tweets about Mr. Mueller's investigation.  You know, when you take all  these things together, these actions of (INAUDIBLE) at least raise the  specter (ph) of President Trump dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>Now, late last night, the way White House law -- one of the White House  lawyers, accusing actually President Trump's lawyer, came out and said that  there is no consideration of firing Mr. Mueller.</p><p>FERRO:  If it happen --</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  That is --</p><p>FERRO:  -- if it happen now Isaac, I try to understand drain the politics  from this, because certainly if you ask a Democrat how significant it would  be that give you want to ask Republican, they give you another.</p><p>Drain the politics from this.  It's constitutionally speaking, how  significant would that be.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  You know, look most of the personnel questions and volatility  does come out in this White House has been again to reality TV spectacle.   Dismissing Mueller would still far close to an actual viable constitutional  crisis.  There would be broad bipartisan rebukes from both ends, both sides  of the isles and both chambers on Congress.</p><p>And I think that it would become the number one talking points having into  the midterms.  So this would have -- firing Mueller would have actual --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  -- real world tangible impact, unlike the personnel carousel  that we've seen at the White House for the pass 14 months or so.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So, Isaac, something else is going to have real world impact  is some of the proposals to roll back financial regulation and we have seen  the recent aspect of Dodd-Frank that's getting world back that affects,  particularly smaller -- banks that are in communities.</p><p>I'm just wondering from your perspective, has the potential regulatory roll  back been price into U.S. financial stocks already.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I think that it's coming close.  And, when we look at some of  these banks, especially because the -- one of the core benefits which is  raising the 50 billion thresholds, is only raise to 100 billion  immediately.  And you have to wait another 18 months before its raise to  250 billion.  And that increase ultimately, I think will be tailwind for  M&amp;A which is part of the story here with community and regional banks.</p><p>My only point of caution is it will take time for that tailwind to fully  materialize.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  When you say --</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  So --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  -- M&amp;A, your talking about among community banks?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Correct.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Correct?  OK.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Community banks and -- and even moving into the regional space.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So -- in other words, you expect the regulatory roll backs to  pave the way to bigger regional banks?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Absolutely.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  OK.  And that hasn't been pricing?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I don't think so.</p><p>FERRO:  Isaac, going forward, this has been bipartisan push, what are the  limits of that?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Well, look this bill that we've been following, that's gone out  of the Senate.  And is now being held up in the House, has Republican  leadership wants to add more to it.  This bill is the last train leaving  the station for a legislative perspective.  This has been eight years in  the making.  It's been --</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  -- and further more, every single data point suggest that  Democrats have a tailwind at their back heading into the midterms,  especially in the House.  So this bill from a legislative perspective, this  is it.  After this is done, we're going to have to start focusing on the  alphabet soup of financial regulators the OCC, FDIC, CFBB and the others to  look for rachial (ph) changes.</p><p>FERRO:  So for us, is anyone talking about infrastructure, and I guess  whistling in the wind?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Well, we're going to get a spending bill tonight and that  spending bill should see increases in some infrastructure spending program.   But other than that, that's it for this Congress.  There is simply no  legislative will to act on broader infrastructure policy in this Congress.</p><p>FERRO:  Isaac Boltansky --</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  All will get, I think we'll see tonight.</p><p>FERRO:  -- always great to catch up with you.  Thank you very much for  joining us sir, the Compass Point, senior VP and policy analyst.

I want to really start with Facebook, because this is what struggling (ph) down futures, ahead of the New York open. How realistic do you think it is that the folks in D.C. will actually make some kind of move on Facebook in the near term?</p><p>ISAAC BOLTANSKY, DIRECTOR OF POLICY RESEARCH, COMPASS POINT RESEARCH: I think my city is going to talk about it a fair amount. But I don't believe that's going to lead to actual action. You know, commerce has a way of moving from headline or crisis to headline or crisis. And there was some focus on social media's impact on the electoral process. At the end of last year on Capitol Hill, but as Congress also does, it simply move on.</p><p>So, we should expect for out of caring and some pointed commentary.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Some key law makers, but as her actual legislative action, it's unlike (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: All right, so -- you're taking off legislative action with respect to the fact that 50 million people's information was expose to at analytics company that helps President Trump get elected and their information was disclose through the Facebook platform.</p><p>Take us behind the scenes. How much will Facebook have to spend in order to ward off any legislative action in lobbying (ph) efforts in discussions, or will it just be sort of a hot topic for a moment and everyone will move on?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: I think that all of the media, freak (ph) social media firms are going to have to increase their D.C. presents over the next few years. The conversations in particularly the policy conversations around a content and -- and proper channel protection and data security and data fluidly (ph), all those things are going to continue in D.C.</p><p>And so all of those firms are going to have to increase their presence in town, even though the likelihood of actual action --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTANSKY: -- redeems well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: With the CEOs might be spending a little bit more time in Washington D.C. as well, I mention (INAUDIBLE), how long before we see the CEOs and these big tech firms just lined up in front of Congress?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: I think it something that's absolutely possible during these Congress.

I want to really start with  Facebook, because this is what struggling (ph) down futures, ahead of the  New York open.  How realistic do you think it is that the folks in D.C.  will actually make some kind of move on Facebook in the near term?</p><p>ISAAC BOLTANSKY, DIRECTOR OF POLICY RESEARCH, COMPASS POINT RESEARCH:  I  think my city is going to talk about it a fair amount.  But I don't believe  that's going to lead to actual action.  You know, commerce has a way of  moving from headline or crisis to headline or crisis.  And there was some  focus on social media's impact on the electoral process.  At the end of  last year on Capitol Hill, but as Congress also does, it simply move on.</p><p>So, we should expect for out of caring and some pointed commentary.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Some key law makers, but as her actual legislative action, it's  unlike (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  All right, so -- you're taking off legislative action with  respect to the fact that 50 million people's information was expose to at  analytics company that helps President Trump get elected and their  information was disclose through the Facebook platform.</p><p>Take us behind the scenes.  How much will Facebook have to spend in order  to ward off any legislative action in lobbying (ph) efforts in discussions,  or will it just be sort of a hot topic for a moment and everyone will move  on?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I think that all of the media, freak (ph) social media firms  are going to have to increase their D.C. presents over the next few years.   The conversations in particularly the policy conversations around a content  and -- and proper channel protection and data security and data fluidly  (ph), all those things are going to continue in D.C.</p><p>And so all of those firms are going to have to increase their presence in  town, even though the likelihood of actual action --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  -- redeems well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  With the CEOs might be spending a little  bit more time in Washington D.C. as well, I mention (INAUDIBLE), how long  before we see the CEOs and these big tech firms just lined up in front of  Congress?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I think it something that's absolutely possible during these  Congress.  These are more and more as he walk the halls of the Hill  concerns about the impact of social media on the election process.  And  with the midterms, only a few months away, I think that there's a real shot  that could happen over the night few months.</p><p>If it's not, then it will be soon, because this topic is going to hang  around Capitol Hill for the first (INAUDIBLE) future.</p><p>FERRO:  So certainly this was another instance playing into the bigger  story of what happened in the election previously, well as Russia's  involvement, what do the tech firms do?  Well rather did not do.  And at  the same triple with that Isaac, special counsel Robert Mueller.  And we  seat in here try to work out, what happens next and if he gets fired, how  significant would it be?  Weigh in please Isaac.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Yes, look weekends at the White right, I mean we had a pretty  active, we had a pretty active weekend with the dismissal of Mr. McCabe,  the tweets about Mr. Mueller's investigation.  You know, when you take all  these things together, these actions of (INAUDIBLE) at least raise the  specter (ph) of President Trump dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>Now, late last night, the way White House law -- one of the White House  lawyers, accusing actually President Trump's lawyer, came out and said that  there is no consideration of firing Mr. Mueller.</p><p>FERRO:  If it happen --</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  That is --</p><p>FERRO:  -- if it happen now Isaac, I try to understand drain the politics  from this, because certainly if you ask a Democrat how significant it would  be that give you want to ask Republican, they give you another.</p><p>Drain the politics from this.  It's constitutionally speaking, how  significant would that be.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  You know, look most of the personnel questions and volatility  does come out in this White House has been again to reality TV spectacle.   Dismissing Mueller would still far close to an actual viable constitutional  crisis.  There would be broad bipartisan rebukes from both ends, both sides  of the isles and both chambers on Congress.</p><p>And I think that it would become the number one talking points having into  the midterms.  So this would have -- firing Mueller would have actual --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  -- real world tangible impact, unlike the personnel carousel  that we've seen at the White House for the pass 14 months or so.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So, Isaac, something else is going to have real world impact  is some of the proposals to roll back financial regulation and we have seen  the recent aspect of Dodd-Frank that's getting world back that affects,  particularly smaller -- banks that are in communities.</p><p>I'm just wondering from your perspective, has the potential regulatory roll  back been price into U.S. financial stocks already.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I think that it's coming close.  And, when we look at some of  these banks, especially because the -- one of the core benefits which is  raising the 50 billion thresholds, is only raise to 100 billion  immediately.  And you have to wait another 18 months before its raise to  250 billion.  And that increase ultimately, I think will be tailwind for  M&amp;A which is part of the story here with community and regional banks.</p><p>My only point of caution is it will take time for that tailwind to fully  materialize.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  When you say --</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  So --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  -- M&amp;A, your talking about among community banks?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Correct.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Correct?  OK.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Community banks and -- and even moving into the regional space.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So -- in other words, you expect the regulatory roll backs to  pave the way to bigger regional banks?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Absolutely.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  OK.  And that hasn't been pricing?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  I don't think so.</p><p>FERRO:  Isaac, going forward, this has been bipartisan push, what are the  limits of that?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Well, look this bill that we've been following, that's gone out  of the Senate.  And is now being held up in the House, has Republican  leadership wants to add more to it.  This bill is the last train leaving  the station for a legislative perspective.  This has been eight years in  the making.  It's been --</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  -- and further more, every single data point suggest that  Democrats have a tailwind at their back heading into the midterms,  especially in the House.  So this bill from a legislative perspective, this  is it.  After this is done, we're going to have to start focusing on the  alphabet soup of financial regulators the OCC, FDIC, CFBB and the others to  look for rachial (ph) changes.</p><p>FERRO:  So for us, is anyone talking about infrastructure, and I guess  whistling in the wind?</p><p>BOLTANSKY:  Well, we're going to get a spending bill tonight and that  spending bill should see increases in some infrastructure spending program.

I want to really start with Facebook, because this is what struggling (ph) down futures, ahead of the New York open. How realistic do you think it is that the folks in D.C. will actually make some kind of move on Facebook in the near term?</p><p>ISAAC BOLTANSKY, DIRECTOR OF POLICY RESEARCH, COMPASS POINT RESEARCH: I think my city is going to talk about it a fair amount. But I don't believe that's going to lead to actual action. You know, commerce has a way of moving from headline or crisis to headline or crisis. And there was some focus on social media's impact on the electoral process. At the end of last year on Capitol Hill, but as Congress also does, it simply move on.</p><p>So, we should expect for out of caring and some pointed commentary.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Some key law makers, but as her actual legislative action, it's unlike (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: All right, so -- you're taking off legislative action with respect to the fact that 50 million people's information was expose to at analytics company that helps President Trump get elected and their information was disclose through the Facebook platform.</p><p>Take us behind the scenes. How much will Facebook have to spend in order to ward off any legislative action in lobbying (ph) efforts in discussions, or will it just be sort of a hot topic for a moment and everyone will move on?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: I think that all of the media, freak (ph) social media firms are going to have to increase their D.C. presents over the next few years. The conversations in particularly the policy conversations around a content and -- and proper channel protection and data security and data fluidly (ph), all those things are going to continue in D.C.</p><p>And so all of those firms are going to have to increase their presence in town, even though the likelihood of actual action --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTANSKY: -- redeems well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: With the CEOs might be spending a little bit more time in Washington D.C. as well, I mention (INAUDIBLE), how long before we see the CEOs and these big tech firms just lined up in front of Congress?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: I think it something that's absolutely possible during these Congress. These are more and more as he walk the halls of the Hill concerns about the impact of social media on the election process. And with the midterms, only a few months away, I think that there's a real shot that could happen over the night few months.</p><p>If it's not, then it will be soon, because this topic is going to hang around Capitol Hill for the first (INAUDIBLE) future.</p><p>FERRO: So certainly this was another instance playing into the bigger story of what happened in the election previously, well as Russia's involvement, what do the tech firms do? Well rather did not do. And at the same triple with that Isaac, special counsel Robert Mueller. And we seat in here try to work out, what happens next and if he gets fired, how significant would it be? Weigh in please Isaac.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Yes, look weekends at the White right, I mean we had a pretty active, we had a pretty active weekend with the dismissal of Mr. McCabe, the tweets about Mr. Mueller's investigation. You know, when you take all these things together, these actions of (INAUDIBLE) at least raise the specter (ph) of President Trump dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>Now, late last night, the way White House law -- one of the White House lawyers, accusing actually President Trump's lawyer, came out and said that there is no consideration of firing Mr. Mueller.</p><p>FERRO: If it happen --</p><p>BOLTANSKY: That is --</p><p>FERRO: -- if it happen now Isaac, I try to understand drain the politics from this, because certainly if you ask a Democrat how significant it would be that give you want to ask Republican, they give you another.</p><p>Drain the politics from this. It's constitutionally speaking, how significant would that be.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: You know, look most of the personnel questions and volatility does come out in this White House has been again to reality TV spectacle. Dismissing Mueller would still far close to an actual viable constitutional crisis. There would be broad bipartisan rebukes from both ends, both sides of the isles and both chambers on Congress.</p><p>And I think that it would become the number one talking points having into the midterms. So this would have -- firing Mueller would have actual --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: -- real world tangible impact, unlike the personnel carousel that we've seen at the White House for the pass 14 months or so.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: So, Isaac, something else is going to have real world impact is some of the proposals to roll back financial regulation and we have seen the recent aspect of Dodd-Frank that's getting world back that affects, particularly smaller -- banks that are in communities.</p><p>I'm just wondering from your perspective, has the potential regulatory roll back been price into U.S. financial stocks already.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: I think that it's coming close. And, when we look at some of these banks, especially because the -- one of the core benefits which is raising the 50 billion thresholds, is only raise to 100 billion immediately. And you have to wait another 18 months before its raise to 250 billion. And that increase ultimately, I think will be tailwind for M&amp;A which is part of the story here with community and regional banks.</p><p>My only point of caution is it will take time for that tailwind to fully materialize.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: When you say --</p><p>BOLTANSKY: So --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: -- M&amp;A, your talking about among community banks?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Correct.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Correct? OK.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Community banks and -- and even moving into the regional space.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: So -- in other words, you expect the regulatory roll backs to pave the way to bigger regional banks?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Absolutely.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: OK. And that hasn't been pricing?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: I don't think so.</p><p>FERRO: Isaac, going forward, this has been bipartisan push, what are the limits of that?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Well, look this bill that we've been following, that's gone out of the Senate. And is now being held up in the House, has Republican leadership wants to add more to it. This bill is the last train leaving the station for a legislative perspective. This has been eight years in the making. It's been --</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>BOLTANSKY: -- and further more, every single data point suggest that Democrats have a tailwind at their back heading into the midterms, especially in the House. So this bill from a legislative perspective, this is it. After this is done, we're going to have to start focusing on the alphabet soup of financial regulators the OCC, FDIC, CFBB and the others to look for rachial (ph) changes.</p><p>FERRO: So for us, is anyone talking about infrastructure, and I guess whistling in the wind?</p><p>BOLTANSKY: Well, we're going to get a spending bill tonight and that spending bill should see increases in some infrastructure spending program. But other than that, that's it for this Congress. There is simply no legislative will to act on broader infrastructure policy in this Congress.</p><p>FERRO: Isaac Boltansky --</p><p>BOLTANSKY: All will get, I think we'll see tonight.</p><p>FERRO: -- always great to catch up with you. Thank you very much for joining us sir, the Compass Point, senior VP and policy analyst.

Nita Lowey's announcement that she would not seek reelection in 2020 has left a sizeable power vacuum in New York's 17th Congressional District, with several Democrats lining up to take her place, including state Sen. David Carlucci, Assemblyman David Buchwald and lawyer Mondaire Jones. And in the past two weeks, two women have joined the race: former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas and Allison Fine, the former board chairwoman of the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fine, who has made her pro-abortion rights stance a pillar of her campaign, is also attempting to distinguish herself with her background in technology, including as a founding board member of the tech community organization Civic Hall. Fine spoke with City &amp; State about Roe v. Wade, Congress failing to lead on tech issues and why she doesn't buy into being labeled a progressive or moderate. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> You are the former chairwoman of the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation board. You founded the Network of Elected Women. You've written three books about online activism. Coming at this race with somewhat of a more national profile than your opponents, how do you pitch yourself to voters in New York's 17th Congressional District?</p><p> I grew up here and live here now. I raised my three children, three boys, in the district. My tech work has focused on how we're changing as people and communities, and how to connect us to one another and use the tools to give everybody a voice, hopefully for good. (That) also means I'm an expert in how tech has been used for bad. So my focus is on how we put the pieces back together for jobs, for our communities, for our personal lives, for this new century. Because the solutions from last century aren't going to work anymore. We have new problems, and we need new solutions.</p><p> In what ways does a national profile help you \u2013 whether that's fundraising or attracting high-profile supporters?</p><p> It certainly helps to have a national network, which I have both through my tech work and my NARAL work. But the district is my home. This is where I'm from, and I care deeply about how we're living, and how our kids are growing up here.</p><p> You've included abortion rights as a major priority in your campaign for Rep. Nita Lowey's seat, now that she's not running for reelection.</p><p> Like Nita, I will be the No. 1 advocate in Congress for supporting women's autonomy and women's health. There's no question that this administration is trying to take away a woman's right to an abortion. And they're packing the courts with judges to do just that. But they're not done with that. Then they move on to making it difficult to access contraception and making it difficult for Planned Parenthood to do its work. At a very fundamental level right now, we have a struggling democracy because we have a struggling middle class. They go hand in hand with one another. And we can never have a robust middle class again if women don't have equal access to economic opportunities and health care.</p><p> You've said that you support a public option for health care but don't think taking private insurance away is feasible. What's your rationale for that?</p><p> In an ideal world, there would have been a public option created as part of Obamacare. It wasn't possible then, (but) I think there is the political will to do that now. And I believe by doing that, private insurance companies will either figure out how to lower their prices and compete with the public option, or they'll go out of business. So the long-term opportunity here is to create a really robust public option. But I don't think it's all politically feasible to take something away from people \u2013 even something we don't like. Nobody likes to have something taken away from them.</p><p> Just having the option taken away, you're saying, is difficult.</p><p> It's un-American.</p><p> You have also made data privacy a pillar of your campaign \u2013 something we don't see a lot of candidates doing. What, in your mind, might federal data privacy legislation look like?</p><p> I think it's similar to what the European Union has done with the General Data Protection Regulation. It's about flipping data privacy over. Right now, data regulations and data privacy \u2013 both within the federal government and in corporations \u2013 favor those institutions over people. So we need to flip that over. We need to give consumers much more responsibility and power in controlling their own data and controlling their own privacy.</p><p> How would you ensure that a federal data privacy law is adequately robust?</p><p> The reason we're not seeing leadership out of Washington, D.C., on this issue is that too many incumbents are in the pocket of Big Tech. I don't take any corporate PAC money and I understand these issues well, and I'm ready to stand up for consumers and users of tech. There's no question that there needs to be federal legislation that creates a common understanding of data privacy and protection in every state. And I want to fight for that.</p><p> Where do you stand on breaking up Big Tech?</p><p> Big Tech is not one thing, right? Google is not Facebook is not Amazon. They're very different kinds of companies. And Google certainly has a stranglehold on search, and there should be ways of trying to introduce competition there. I think the biggest problem we have in terms of anti-competition right now is Amazon. Every retail store in the country is feeling the lack of competition because of the lack of regulation and taxation on Amazon. And that's a huge problem. We're going to be looking at a future, very soon, of desolated downtowns and retail stores. There ought to be more action to try to forestall that and have at least more competition online for retail.</p><p> When Amazon HQ2 was coming to Queens, did you support HQ2 before it was canceled?</p><p> I'm not really ready to say. I'm going to take a pass on that one.</p><p> We've also seen tech executives like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appear before Congress, and it's become clear that some lawmakers have a very hazy idea of how these companies work. How serious is this gap in tech knowledge among lawmakers?</p><p> I think it's an incredible deficit that we have. And I think that's why so little action has taken place. I think so many people in Washington think of tech just with their own framework \u2013 that it's brick-and-mortar retail, and it's not at all. You have to understand that it's not just the size that's the problem with these companies. It's the DNA, it's the makeup of how they operate, how they use data, and that is so vital. And if you don't understand that, you can't figure out how to regulate them.</p><p> What's your impression of the other candidates in the race for the 17th Congressional District?</p><p> I don't want to be in the business of criticizing other Democrats. I will just talk about me, and I think that people want somebody who understands their communities very well. And, frankly, this is a woman's seat. And I don't think a Congress that is 23% female has any women's seats to waste.</p><p> Would you call yourself a progressive Democrat? A moderate? Where do you fall on that spectrum?</p><p> I think that's kind of a false dichotomy. I'm not sure the continuum still holds up. I am strongly, strongly in favor of creating job security for people, for jobs that don't look like what they used to look like. This is just a huge issue, that so many people are freelancing or are contract or gig economy workers. And we need to make sure they have the benefits and the security that they deserve as employees.</p><p> Something like California's AB5, which would force many gig workers to be treated as employees? Is that something you think should be happening at the federal level?</p><p> I think it absolutely should. And I think it's essential, frankly, to making sure that we have a middle class in America, a growing middle class. First of all, everybody deserves protection as workers, and there should be the opportunity to take your retirement account with you, to take your sick days with you, of course to take your health care with you, and to take your union with you, as we move from job to job.</p><p> Finally, we're in the thick of impeachment proceedings right now. What's your impression so far?</p><p> I think (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi did exactly the right thing. There was no question that for the good of democracy and the good of the country the president has to be held accountable for basically trying to shake down Ukraine for personal political purposes. The impeachment hearings are doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing, which is holding the administration fully accountable for their actions. And it doesn't matter where it goes from there. The point is, nobody's above the law and we have separation of powers in the federal government for just this reason.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-26f0594f6f38e58b1f4709e32f69ba30ea343</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CBD98D19EA5 NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJS-JDJ1-JBCN-44K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Manhattan Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The retail juggernaut was days from announcing its $13.8 billion purchase of Whole Foods, a deal that would not only roil the grocery industry but also trigger a government antitrust investigation into the strategies and practices of the \"Everything Store.\" And, as Zapolsky was no doubt aware, no organization had been more dogged in raising those concerns than New America - and, in particular, a 28-year-old law student named Lina Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this year, the Yale Law Journal published a 24,000-word \"note\" by Khan titled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\" The article laid out with remarkable clarity and sophistication why American antitrust law has evolved to the point that it is no longer equipped to deal with tech giants such as Amazon.com, which has made itself as essential to commerce in the 21st century as the railroads, telephone systems and computer hardware makers were in the 20th.</p><p>It's not just Amazon, however, that animates concerns about competition and market power, and Khan is not the only one who is worrying. The same issues lie behind the European Union's recent $2.7 billion fine against Google for favoring its own services in the search results it presents to its users. They are also at the heart of the long-running battle in the telecom industry over net neutrality and the ability of cable companies and Internet service providers to give favorable treatment to their own content. They are implicated in complaints that Facebook has aided the rise of \"fake news\" while draining readers and revenue from legitimate news media. They even emerge in debates over the corrupting role of corporate money in politics, the decline in entrepreneurship, the slowdown in corporate investment and the rise of income inequality.</p><p>And just this week, Democrats cited stepped-up antitrust enforcement as a centerpiece of their plan to deliver \"a better deal\" for Americans should they regain control of Congress and the White House.</p><p>For Amazon, which prides itself on its relentless consumer focus, the suggestion that its spectacular growth might not be in the public interest poses a particular challenge. Since it was published, Khan's \"note\" has drawn more than 50,000 readers online - an extraordinary reach for a law review article. Her work has been cited by the Economist, the Financial Times, Forbes, Wired, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and she has appeared on major broadcast media. Last spring, she was invited to join some of the most prominent academics in antitrust law to speak at an economic conference at the University of Chicago.</p><p>Khan is amazed and a bit amused by all the attention. Born in London, where her Pakistani parents met as college students, she grew up in a well-to-do New York City suburb before heading off to Williams College, where she was editor of the school newspaper. Looking toward a future in journalism, she moved to Washington and soon found herself working as a researcher at New America in its Open Markets Program on issues relating to economic power. (Khan cut her teeth writing about the dangers of industry consolidation for the Washington Monthly magazine.)</p><p>Thinking a law degree would allow her to be a more effective advocate, she headed off to Yale Law, where she impressed instructors with her keen mind, thorough preparation and passion for economic justice. In her second year, she began researching the history of antitrust law to understand why it has failed to provide much of a check on corporate power. \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" was the result.</p><p>\"I was blown away by what she produced,\" said David Grewal, a professor who advised Khan on her project. \"It didn't read like a student note. It was equal to the best legal scholarship, combining scholarly elegance with an activist agenda and enormous attention to detail.</p><p>\"Most of my colleagues would give their little finger for a piece that got that much attention,\" Grewal said, only half joking.</p><p>Next year, after the bar exam and a wedding, Khan will return to Yale for a postgraduate year before heading off for a clerkship with Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California, a \"feeder judge\" to clerkships on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of Robert Bork's \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a book that even its critics acknowledge changed the direction of antitrust law.</p><p>Although a longtime law professor at Yale, Bork was a charter member of the \"Chicago school\" of law and economics, which argued that judges should use rigorous analysis of economic consequences in deciding antitrust cases. Previously, much of antitrust doctrine was based on somewhat vague political notions that big was bad - that large corporations with large market shares inevitably used their power to drive rivals from the market, raise prices, buy favorable treatment from legislators and regulators. In 1963, the Supreme Court even went so far as to declare that any merger that achieved more than 30 percent share of any market should be considered unlawful.</p><p>Relying on economic theories that competition - or the threat of it - could be counted on to discipline dominant firms, Bork argued that rather than helping consumers, most antitrust enforcement was likely to do the opposite, stifling innovation and preventing companies from realizing efficiencies of scale and scope that could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, more choice and greater convenience.</p><p>Chicago school economics was a marriage of the latest in economic modeling and free market ideology. In considering whether a proposed merger or business practice would harm competition, courts and regulators narrowed their analysis to ask whether it would hurt consumers by raising prices. And since Chicago theory pretty much assumed away the ability of even a dominant firm to raise prices, the answer was almost always no.</p><p>And so began a 30-year stretch in which the government blocked relatively few mergers and prosecuted almost no companies for monopolizing competition.</p><p>\"The Chicago school runs deep, and the courts still partake of the Borkian Kool-Aid,\" said Steven Salop, an antitrust expert at the Georgetown University Law Center who has long argued that antitrust enforcement is too permissive.</p><p>At the Chicago conference this spring, Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge who, with Bork, is considered a pioneer of Chicago antitrust analysis, asked mischievously, \"Antitrust is dead, isn't it?\"</p><p>There is little debate that this cramped view of antitrust law has resulted in an economy where two-thirds of all industries are more concentrated than they were 20 years ago, according to a study by President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and many are dominated by three or four firms. What's now at issue is whether the outcome has benefited society.</p><p>Research by John Kwoka of Northeastern University, for example, has found that three-quarters of mergers have resulted in price increases without any offsetting benefits. Kwoka cited industries such as airlines, hotels, car rentals, cable television and eyeglasses.</p><p>And even former antitrust officials acknowledge that their approval of Google's purchase of YouTube and ITA Software and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp look naive in hindsight, eliminating the kinds of companies that might have someday challenged the tech sector's most dominant firms.</p><p>\"The current market is not always a good indication of competitive harm,\" said Khan in laying out for me her critique of the way the government goes about analyzing proposed mergers. \"They have to ask what the future market will look like.\"</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, complain that antitrust analysis has failed to fully incorporate the insights of modern game theory, information theory and behavioral economics that go a long way to explaining why consumers, companies and markets don't behave the way Chicago school theory says they should.</p><p>As Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole has demonstrated, Chicago antitrust theory is ill equipped to deal with high-tech industries, which naturally tend toward winner-take-all competition. In these, most of the expenses are in the form of upfront investments, such as software (think Apple and Microsoft), meaning that the cost of serving additional customers is close to zero. Customers naturally gravitate to the platform with the largest network of customers (think Facebook). Or their success depends on having the most customer data (think Google).</p><p>They also often have two sets of customers who need each other, such as credit card companies that serve merchants and cardholders, or Internet service providers that link content producers with content consumers.</p><p>What this \"post-Chicago\" economics shows is that in such industries, firms that jump into an early lead can gain such an overwhelming advantage that new rivals find it nearly impossible to enter the market, while even experienced ones find it difficult to stay in the game.</p><p>To varying degrees, Amazon displays all these characteristics, and by its breadth and complexity, confounds traditional antitrust analysis. What began as an online book retailer now sells just about everythingunder the sun- not just online but, more recently, also through physical stores and pickup depots. In hundreds of high-volume categories, Amazon is not only a retailer but also produces its own branded line of merchandise.</p><p>Through its online marketplace, customers can buy from Amazon but also from millions of competing retailers who typically pay a 15 percent to 20\u00a0percent commission and now account for half of all unit sales on the Amazon platform - and a quarter of Amazon's total profits. Many of these \"third-party sellers\" pay additional fees to store their inventory in Amazon warehouses, use Amazon robots and personnel to fulfill customer orders, or rely on Amazon to deliver their goods to customers across the globe through its fleet of 25 planes and 4,000 trucks or its deeply discounted delivery contracts with UPS and FedEx.</p><p>This remarkable business machine, offering 350 million items for sale, is fast approaching the point where it can claim nearly every household in America as a customer. And through its $99-a-year Prime program, Amazon uses free delivery and access to its premium video service to bolster loyalty of customers who each spend an average of $1,500 per year. (The experience of my own household surely attests to this.) By one estimate, at current growth rates, half of all American households will be Prime customers by 2020.</p><p>This description of Amazon's business is drawn largely from its public filings and reports from market analysts. As is its custom, Amazon declined to comment or answer questions for the record. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's founder and chief executive, is the owner of The Washington Post.</p><p>\"Amazon has brought us to a new and better place,\" Khan said. \"So did the early railroads and steel company giants. But I don't think Amazon is the problem - the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon illustrates that in a powerful way.\"</p><p>Is Amazon so successful, is it getting so big, that it poses a threat to consumers or competition? By current antitrust standards, certainly not.</p><p>Here is a company, after all, known for disrupting and turbocharging competition in every market it enters, lowering prices and forcing rivals to match the relentless efficiency of its operations and the quality of its service. That is, after all, usually how firms come to dominate an industry, and there is nothing illegal about that. But under the antitrust law, once a firm is dominant, its actions and business practices become subject to more rigorous scrutiny, to make sure it is not abusing its dominant position. And like all dominant firms, Amazon disputes its dominance.</p><p>Much is made of the fact that more than half - 55 percent - of Americans begin their online shopping trips on Amazon. But as Amazon is quick to point out, online sales still account for less than 10 percent of all retail sales, which is the more relevant figure as the line between online and bricks-and-mortar disappears. By that standard, Walmart is still nearly four times Amazon's size.</p><p>Retailing, however, is a sector, not a product market, the usual frame of reference for antitrust analysis. And other than books, Amazon's original market where it maintains a commanding 40\u00a0percent market share, Amazon doesn't have anything close to monopoly-like market shares.</p><p>In clothing, for example, where it has made a big push, Amazon accounts for 20\u00a0percent of online sales but less than 7\u00a0percent overall. Amazon will soon dethrone Best Buy as the largest seller of consumer electronics, but even there, its overall share will be only 20\u00a0percent. Amazon's purchase of the parent of Diapers.com has helped give it a 43 percent share of the online baby products market, but that translates into less than 20 percent of overall sales in that category.</p><p>Even with the Whole Foods purchase, Amazon will have only a 2 percent share of the $600\u00a0billion-a-year American grocery market, well below the more than 20\u00a0percent market share for Walmart and 7\u00a0percent for Kroger. That is why most antitrust experts think there is little chance that the government will try to block the deal.</p><p>But in her article, Khan argues that these metrics do not capture the \"architecture\" of Amazon's emerging market power.</p><p>If Amazon is so small and its growth so benign, she asks, then why does the prospect of Amazon's entry into a market dramatically drive up its own stock price while driving down those of its rivals?</p><p>Why, she asks, have so many large and successful bricks-and-mortar retailers been unable to make significant inroads into online retailing while so many small retailers feel they have no choice but to use Amazon's platform to reach their customers?</p><p>Antitrust analysis generally assumes dominant firms often exercise their market power by raising prices, but what if Amazon exercises its market power, Khan asks, by squeezing the profit margins of its suppliers? What if its strategy is to keep prices low in markets it dominates to gain entry into new markets that will generate still more sales and profits?</p><p>How, she asks, can antitrust regulators analyze the structure of a market, and Amazon's bargaining power in it, when so many of Amazon's competitors are also its customers or suppliers? Why did Sears stock rise 19 percent on the day that it announced its Kenmore line of appliances would be sold through Amazon? Why do Walmart, Google, Oracle and UPS all consider Amazon their biggest threat?</p><p>And if Amazon is not a monopolist, Khan asks, why are financial markets pricing its stock as if it is going to be?</p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers should be . . . concerned about the fact that Amazon increasingly controls the infrastructure of online commerce and the ways it is harnessing this dominance to expand and advantage its new business ventures,\" Khan wrote in her law review article.</p><p>As Khan sees it, Amazon's strategy and business practices are \"neither anticipated nor understood by current antitrust doctrines,\" and the language and tools by which regulators and judges now analyze the company's business practices \"totally miss the game.\"</p><p>\"What's the difference between behavior designed to increase market share and behavior to drive out competitors?\" Khan asks. \"The problem is they look a lot alike.\"</p><p>It probably won't surprise you to learn that most antitrust practitioners reject accusations from a third-year law student that the legal precedents and analytical tools they have developed and mastered over the years are inadequate to the task of protecting us from the predations of Big Tech.</p><p>\"Lame argument,\" huffs Timothy Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who, as chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, helped bring the monopolization case against Microsoft.</p><p>\"I don't lie awake at night worrying that there are so few creative people in this country that one company might turn out to be the best at everything,\" said a former head of the antitrust division.</p><p>A former member of the Federal Trade Commission put it this way: \"The antitrust law I believe in is that we want to give as much latitude as possible to innovate and deliver better products at lower prices, and only stop them when we see some evidence of conduct that excludes others from competing.\"</p><p>They also scorn Khan's suggestion that the consumer welfare standard that underlies most antitrust analysis should be broadened to a public interest standard that takes into account the impact of dominant firms on workers, communities and the political process. As they see it, such vague and subjective standards would merely invite political and ideological mischief.</p><p>But if you push them, most of these old antitrust hands will also acknowledge that the law has not fully come to grips with the competitive dynamic in the era of online platforms and networks.</p><p>\"I think there is a fair bit of flexibility in the law to allow us to adjust and adapt to modern markets and technologies,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.</p><p>Moss cited recent cases that looked beyond consumer prices to take in issues such as innovation, bargaining power and arrangements that lock consumers into existing products. The real problem, she said, is in getting more judges and enforcement agency officials to pay attention to those issues.</p><p>Indeed without the focus on prices, judges would be forced to make more subjective judgments about the intent behind a company's action or speculate about whether new companies would, or could, enter a market in the future. While judges are reluctant to wade into such murky waters, particularly in markets where the technology and business strategies are rapidly evolving, it is precisely in those industries that a more holistic approach is required.</p><p>Lurking in the background of the current debate is U.S. v Microsoft, the biggest antimonopoly case to come along in a generation. While the Chicago school's antitrust adherents view the Clinton-era prosecution of the software giant as a flagrant overreach against a successful innovator, defenders of the antitrust law cite it as proof that current law has been successful in dealing with high-tech monopolists. And, indeed, if the trial judge's ruling had been fully upheld, that might be the proper conclusion.</p><p>But, in fact, a federal appeals court subsequently narrowed that ruling and rejected the trial judge's order that the company should be broken up, as John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust had been nearly a century before. In the end, the case was settled by the Bush administration on terms considered largely favorable to Microsoft.</p><p>The ambiguous legacy of the Microsoft case - and the relative weakness of American antitrust law - was highlighted last month when the European Union imposed a record fine on Google for using its virtual monopoly in Internet search to favor its own comparative shopping sites. The Federal Trade Commission had looked at the same issue several years before and closed its investigation without taking serious action. One reason: It was not clear that, even if Google is favoring its own site (which it denies), such practices are illegal.</p><p>That wasn't always the case. Back in the pre-Chicago days when big was bad, the Supreme Court had ruled that Eastman Kodak could not leverage its monopoly in the film market to gain advantage in the market for film developing. But in more recent cases, the Supreme Court and two appeals courts, relying on Chicago law and economics, raised the bar, declaring that there must be a \"dangerous probability\" of obtaining a second monopoly for a dominant firm's behavior to be illegal.</p><p>Some observers point to the E.U.'s Google case as an example of the difference between the American and European approach: They protect competitors; we protect consumers. This often-used distinction betrays a cultural smugness on the part of Americans, one based on the view that our approach fosters the kind of creative destruction that results in great leaps of technological, managerial or financial innovation, while theirs allows second-rate rivals to accomplish through politics what they could not accomplish in the marketplace.</p><p>To me, this view betrays a naive belief that in our open market system, every person and every company has the same opportunity to succeed. Although government cannot and should not try to neutralize all the ways in which success breeds more success, neither should we assume that success in the marketplace is solely due to hard work, ingenuity and superior execution. Leveling the playing field is a legitimate policy goal. A good economic system is not only efficient but also conforms to common intuitions of fair play.</p><p>The logic and intent behind America's century-old antitrust laws is that even innovation- and productivity-inducing competition needs to be managed to ensure a healthy ecosystem in which a relatively few corporate giants don't use the economic advantages they have won to tilt the playing field even further in their favor.</p><p>\"I think we have to go back to the original spirit of the antitrust laws,\" said Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school known for his skepticism about government regulation. \"A narrow, purely economic approach has been unable to capture the concerns people have about the concentration of economic and political power.\"</p><p>While Amazon is not yet a threat to competition, it is well on its way to becoming one, which is probably why the company is taking these arguments - and those who make them - more seriously. Amazon is reported to be in the market for an antitrust economist, and in the wake of the Whole Foods announcement, it has engaged the services of two former heads of the Justice Department antitrust division, one Democrat and one Republican.</p><p>I can't tell you exactly at what point the government should step in to block Amazon from buying another company or curtail some of its business practices. I am, however, fairly confident in saying that it ought to be well before Amazon achieves a 40 percent market share in books, groceries, clothing, hardware, electronics and home furnishings. And it ought to be before Amazon pulls even with UPS in shipping, Oracle in computing and Comcast in media content. Khan's reasonable insight is that if we don't yet have the tools to identify when companies have reached that competitive tipping point, then someone ought to invent them.</p><p>And as for those \"bad old days\" when government officials still had the wisdom and the courage to call a monopolist a monopolist, let's remember it was the government's aborted prosecution of IBM, the most innovative and respected company of its day, that made Microsoft possible; the prosecution of Microsoft that made Google possible; and the breakup of AT&amp;T that made Apple and wireless telephony possible.</p><p>\"Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and every day they deliver enormously valuable products,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in a speech last month at New America. \"But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors that want their chance to change the world.\"</p><p>There is nothing in economic theory that makes it inevitable that successful disrupters will be disrupted. Indeed, what history demonstrates - and what a 28-year-old law student now reminds us - is that it sometimes takes a little public power to keep private power in check.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pearlstein@washpost.com\">pearlstein@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ca382c8473d111e78839ec48ec4cae25</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P49-6WV1-JB4M-V51J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3976\"/><timeReceived>6:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 28, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The retail juggernaut was days from announcing its $13.8 billion purchase of Whole Foods, a deal that would not only roil the grocery industry but also trigger a government antitrust investigation into the strategies and practices of the \"Everything Store.\" And, as Zapolsky was no doubt aware, no organization had been more dogged in raising those concerns than New America - and in particular, a 28-year-old law student named Lina Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this year, the Yale Law Journal had published a 24,000-word \"note\" by Khan titled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\" The article laid out with remarkable clarity and sophistication why American antitrust law has evolved to the point that it is no longer equipped to deal with tech giants such as Amazon, which has made itself as essential to commerce in the 21st century as the railroads, telephone systems and computer hardware makers had been in the 20th. </p><p>It's not just Amazon, however, that animates concerns about competition and market power, and Khan is not the only one who is worrying. The same issues lie behind the European Union's recent $2.7 billion fine against <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>for favoring its own services in the search results it presents to its users. They are also at the heart of the long-running battle in the telecom industry over net neutrality, and the ability of cable companies and Internet service providers to give favorable treatment to their own content. They are implicated in complaints that Facebook has aided the rise of \"fake news\" while draining readers and revenue from legitimate news media. They even emerge in debates over the corrupting role of corporate money in politics, the decline in entrepreneurship, the slowdown in corporate investment and the rise of income inequality. </p><p>And just this week, Democrats cited stepped-up antitrust enforcement as a centerpiece of their plan to deliver \"a better deal\" for Americans should they regain control of Congress and the White House. </p><p>For Amazon, which prides itself on its relentless consumer focus, the suggestion that its spectacular growth might not be in the public interest poses a particular challenge. Since it was published, Khan's \"note\" has drawn more than 50,000 readers online - an extraordinary reach for a law review article. Her work has been cited by the Economist, the Financial Times, Forbes, Wired, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and she has appeared on major broadcast media. Last spring, she was invited to join some of the most prominent academics in antitrust law to speak at an economic conference at the University of Chicago. </p><p>Khan is amazed and a bit amused by all the attention. Born in London, where her Pakistani parents met as college students, she grew up in a well-to-do New York City suburb before heading off to Williams College, where she was editor of the school newspaper. Looking toward a future in journalism, she moved to Washington and soon found herself working as a researcher at New America on issues relating to economic power. </p><p>Thinking a law degree would allow her to be a more effective advocate, she headed off to Yale Law, where she impressed instructors with her keen mind, thorough preparation and passion for economic justice. In her second year, she began researching the history of antitrust law to understand why it has failed to provide much of a check on corporate power. \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" was the result.</p><p>\"I was blown away by what she produced,\" said David Grewal, a professor who advised Khan on her project. \"It didn't read like a student note. It was equal to the best legal scholarship, combining scholarly elegance with an activist agenda and enormous attention to detail.</p><p>\"Most of my colleagues would give their little finger for a piece that got that much attention,\" Grewal said, only half joking. </p><p>Next year, after the bar exam and a wedding, Khan will return to Yale for a post-graduate year before heading off for a clerkship with Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the U.S. Court of Appeals in California, a \"feeder judge\" to clerkships on the Supreme Court. </p><p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of Robert Bork's \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a book that even its critics acknowledge changed the direction of antitrust law. </p><p>Although a longtime law professor at Yale, Bork was a charter member of the \"Chicago school\" of law and economics, which argued that judges should use rigorous analysis of economic consequences in deciding antitrust cases. Previously, much of antitrust doctrine was based on somewhat vague political notions that big was bad - that large corporations with large market shares inevitably used their power to drive rivals from the market, raise prices, buy favorable treatment from legislators and regulators. In 1963, the Supreme Court even went so far as to declare that any merger that achieved more than 30 percent share of any market should be considered unlawful.</p><p>Relying on economic theories that competition - or the threat of it - could be counted on to discipline dominant firms, Bork argued that, rather than helping consumers, most antitrust enforcement was likely to do the opposite, stifling innovation and preventing companies from realizing efficiencies of scale and scope that could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, more choice and greater convenience. </p><p>Chicago school economics was a marriage of the latest in economic modeling and free market ideology. In considering whether a proposed merger or business practice would harm competition, courts and regulators narrowed their analysis to ask whether it would hurt consumers by raising prices. And since Chicago theory pretty much assumed away the ability of even a dominant firm to raise prices, the answer was almost always no. </p><p>And so began a 30-year stretch in which the government blocked relatively few mergers or prosecuted almost no companies for monopolizing competition. </p><p>\"The Chicago school runs deep and the courts still partake of the Borkian Kool-Aid,\" said Steven Salop, an antitrust expert at Georgetown Law Center, who has long argued that antitrust enforcement is too permissive. </p><p>At that Chicago conference this spring, Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge who, with Bork, is considered a pioneer of Chicago antitrust analysis, asked mischievously, \"Antitrust is dead, isn't it?\"</p><p>There is little debate that this cramped view of antitrust law has resulted in an economy where two-thirds of all industries are more concentrated than they were 20 years ago, according to a study by President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and many are dominated by three or four firms. What's now at issue is whether the outcome has benefited society. </p><p>Research by John Kwoka of Northeastern University, for example, has found that three-quarters of mergers have resulted in price increases without any offsetting benefits. Kwoka cited industries such as airlines, hotels, car rents, cable television and eyeglasses.</p><p>And even former antitrust officials now acknowledge that their approval of <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>purchase of YouTube and ITA Software and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and whatsapp look naive in hindsight, eliminating the kinds of companies that might have someday challenged the tech sector's most dominant firms. </p><p>\"The current market is not always a good indication of competitive harm,\" said Khan in laying out for me her critique of the way the government goes about analyzing proposed mergers. \"They have to ask what the future market will look like.\"</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, complain that antitrust analysis has failed to fully incorporate the insights of modern game theory, information theory and behavioral economics that go a long way to explaining why consumers, companies and markets don't behave the way Chicago school theory says they should. </p><p>As Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole has demonstrated, Chicago antitrust theory is ill equipped to deal with high-tech industries, which naturally tend toward winner-take-all competition. In these, most of the expenses are in the form of upfront investments, such as software (think Apple and Microsoft), meaning that the cost of serving additional customers is close to zero. Customers naturally gravitate to the platform with the largest network of customers (think Facebook). Or their success depends on having the most customer data (think <person><nameText>Google</nameText></person>). </p><p>They also often have two sets of customers who need each other, such as credit card companies that serve merchants and cardholders, or Internet service providers that link content producers with content consumers. </p><p>What this \"post-Chicago\" economics shows is that in such industries, firms that jump into an early lead can gain such an overwhelming advantage that new rivals find it nearly impossible to enter the market, while even experienced ones find it difficult to stay in the game. </p><p>To varying degrees, Amazon displays all these characteristics, and by its breadth and complexity, confounds traditional antitrust analysis. What began as an online book retailer now sells just about everything under the sun- not just online but more recently through physical stores and pickup-depots. In hundreds of high-volume categories, Amazon is not only a retailer but produces its own branded line of merchandise. </p><p>Through its online marketplace, customers can buy from Amazon, but also from millions of competing retailers who typically pay a 15 to 20\u00a0percent commission and now account for half of all unit sales on the Amazon platform - and a quarter of Amazon's total profits. Many of these \"third-party sellers\" pay additional fees to store their inventory in Amazon warehouses, or use Amazon robots and personnel to fulfill customer orders, or rely on Amazon to deliver their goods to customers across the globe through its own fleet of 25 planes and 4,000 trucks or its deeply discounted delivery contracts with UPS and FedEx. </p><p>This remarkable business machine, offering 350 million items for sale, is fast approaching the point where it can claim nearly every household in America as a customer. And through its $99-a-year Prime program, Amazon uses free delivery and access to its premium video service to bolster loyalty of customers who each now spend an average of $1,500 per year. (The experience of my own household surely attests to this.) By one estimate, at current growth rates, half of all American households will be Prime customers by 2020. </p><p>This description of Amazon's business is drawn largely from its public filings and reports from market analysts. As is its custom, Amazon declined to comment or answer questions for the record. Jeff Bezos, the company's founder and chief executive, is the owner of The Washington Post.</p><p>\"Amazon has brought us to a new and better place,\" Khan said. \"So did the early railroads and steel company giants. But I don't think Amazon is the problem - the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon illustrates that in a powerful way.\" </p><p>Is Amazon so successful, is it getting so big, that it poses a threat to consumers or competition? By current antitrust standards, certainly not. </p><p>Here is a company, after all, known for disrupting and turbocharging competition in every market it enters, lowering prices and forcing rivals to match the relentless efficiency of its operations and the quality of its service. That is after all usually how firms come to dominate an industry, and there is nothing illegal about that. But under the antitrust law, once a firm is dominant, its actions and business practices become subject to more rigorous scrutiny, to make sure it is not abusing its dominant position. And like all dominant firms, Amazon disputes its dominance.</p><p>Much is made of the fact that more than half - 55 percent - of Americans now begin their online shopping trips on Amazon. But as Amazon is quick to point out, online sales still account for less than 10 percent of all retails sales, which is the more relevant figure as the line between online and brick-and-mortar disappears. By that standard, Walmart is still nearly four times Amazon's size.</p><p>Retailing, however, is a sector, not a product market, the usual frame of reference for antitrust analysis. And other than books, Amazon's original market where it maintains a commanding 40 percent market share, Amazon doesn't have anything close to monopoly-like market shares.</p><p>In clothing, for example, where it has made a big push, Amazon now accounts for 20\u00a0percent of online sales, but less than 7\u00a0percent overall. Amazon will soon dethrone Best Buy as the largest seller of consumer electronics, but even there its overall share will be only 20 percent. Amazon's purchase of the parent of Diapers.com has helped to give it a 43 percent share of the online baby products market, but that translates into less than 20 percent of overall sales in that category. </p><p>Even with the Whole Foods purchase, Amazon will have only a 2 percent share of the $600\u00a0billion a year American grocery market, well below the more than 20\u00a0percent market share for Walmart and 7\u00a0percent for Kroger's. That is why most antitrust experts think there is little chance that the government will try to block the deal. </p><p>But in her article, Khan argues that these metrics do not capture the \"architecture\" of Amazon's emerging market power. </p><p>If Amazon is so small and its growth so benign, she asks, then why does the prospect of Amazon's entry into a market dramatically drive up its own stock price while driving down those of its rivals? </p><p>Why, she asks, have so many large and successful brick-and-mortar retailers been unable to make significant inroads into on-line retailing while so many small retailers feel they have no choice but to use Amazon's platform to reach their customers? </p><p>Antitrust analysis generally assumes dominant firms often exercise their market power by raising prices, but what if Amazon exercises its market power, Khan asks, by squeezing the profit margins of its suppliers? What if its strategy is to keep prices low in markets it dominates to gain entry into new markets that will generate still more sales and profits? </p><p>How, she asks, can antitrust regulators analyze the structure of a market, and Amazon's bargaining power in it, when so many of Amazon's competitors are also its customers or suppliers? Why did Sears stock rise 19 percent on the day that it announced its Kenmore line of appliances would be sold through Amazon? Why do Walmart, <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>Oracle and UPS all consider Amazon their biggest threat?</p><p>And if Amazon is not a monopolist, Khan asks, why are financial markets pricing its stock as if it is going to be? </p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers should be . . . concerned about the fact that Amazon increasingly controls the infrastructure of online commerce and the ways it is harnessing this dominance to expand and advantage its new business ventures,\" Khan wrote in her law review article.</p><p>As Khan sees it, Amazon's strategy and business practices are \"neither anticipated nor understood by current antitrust doctrines, and the language and tools by which regulators and judges now analyze the company's business practices \"totally miss the game.\"</p><p>\"What's the difference between behavior designed to increase market share and behavior to drive out competitors?\" Khan asks. \"The problem is they look a lot alike.\" </p><p>It probably won't surprise you to learn that most antitrust practitioners reject accusations from a third-year law student that the legal precedents and analytical tools they have developed and mastered over the years are inadequate to the task of protecting us from the predations of Big Tech.</p><p>\"Lame argument,\" huffs Timothy Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who, as chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, helped bring the monopolization case against Microsoft. </p><p>\"I don't lie awake at night worrying that there are so few creative people in this country that one company might turn out to be the best at everything,\" said a former head of the antitrust division. </p><p>A former member of the Federal Trade Commission put it this way: \"The antitrust law I believe in is that we want to give as much latitude as possible to innovate and deliver better products at lower prices, and only stop them when we see some evidence of conduct that excludes others from competing.\"</p><p>They also scorn Khan's suggestion that the consumer welfare standard that underlies most antitrust analysis should be broadened to a public interest standard that takes into account the impact of dominant firms on workers, communities and the political process. As they see it, such vague and subjective standards would merely invite political and ideological mischief. </p><p>But if you push them, most of these old antitrust hands will also acknowledge that the law has not fully come to grips with the competitive dynamic in the era of online platforms and networks.</p><p>\"I think there is a fair bit of flexibility in the law to allow us to adjust and adapt to modern markets and technologies,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. </p><p>Moss cited recent cases that looked beyond consumer prices to take in issues like innovation, bargaining power and arrangements that lock consumers into existing products. The real problem, she said, is in getting more judges and the enforcement agency officials to pay attention to those issues.</p><p>Indeed without the focus on prices, judges would be forced to make more subjective judgments about the intent behind a company's action or speculate about whether new companies would, or could, enter a market in the future. While judges are reluctant to wade into such murky waters, particularly in markets where the technology and business strategies are rapidly evolving, it is precisely in those industries that a more holistic approach is required. </p><p>Lurking in the background of the current debate is U.S. v Microsoft, the biggest anti-monopoly case to come along in a generation. While the Chicago school's antitrust adherents view the Clinton-era prosecution of the software giant as a flagrant overreach against a successful innovator, defenders of the antitrust law cite it as proof that current law has been successful in dealing with high-tech monopolists. And, indeed, if the trial judge's ruling had been fully upheld, that might be the proper conclusion.</p><p>But, in fact, a federal appeals court subsequently narrowed that ruling and rejected the trial judge's order that the company should be broken up, as John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust had been nearly a century before. In the end, the case was settled by the Bush administration on terms considered largely favorable to Microsoft. </p><p>The ambiguous legacy of the Microsoft case - and the relative weakness of American antitrust law - was highlighted last month when the European Union imposed a record fine on <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>for using its virtual monopoly in Internet search to favor its own comparative shopping sites. The Federal Trade Commission had looked at the same issue several years before and closed its investigation without taking any serious action. One reason: It was not clear that, even if <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>is favoring its own site (which it denies), such practices are illegal. </p><p>That wasn't always the case. Back in the pre-Chicago days when big was bad, the Supreme Court had ruled that Eastman Kodak could not leverage its monopoly in the film market to gain advantage in the market for film developing. But in more recent cases, the Supreme Court and two appeals courts, relying on Chicago law and economics, raised the bar, declaring that there must be a \"dangerous probability\" of obtaining a second monopoly for a dominant firm's behavior to be illegal. </p><p>Some observers point to the E.U.'s <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>case as an example of the difference between the American and European approach: They protect competitors, we protect consumers. This often-used distinction betrays a cultural smugness on the part of Americans, one based on the view that our approach fosters the kind of creative destruction that results in great leaps of technological, managerial or financial innovation, while theirs allows second-rate rivals to accomplish through politics what they could not accomplish in the marketplace.</p><p>To me, this view betrays a naive belief that in our open market system, every person and every company has the same opportunity to succeed. Although government cannot and should not try to neutralize all the ways in which success breeds more success, neither should we assume that success in the marketplace is solely due to hard work, ingenuity and superior execution. Leveling the playing field is a legitimate policy goal. A good economic system is not only efficient but conforms to common intuitions of fair play.</p><p>The logic and intent behind America's century-old antitrust laws is that even innovation and productivity inducing competition needs to be managed to ensure a healthy ecosystem in which a relatively few corporate giants don't use the economic advantages they have won to tilt the playing field even further in their favor. </p><p>\"I think we have to go back to the original spirit of the antitrust laws,\" said Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school known for his skepticism about government regulation. \"A narrow, purely economic approach has been unable to capture the concerns people have about the concentration of economic and political power.\" </p><p>While Amazon is not yet a threat to competition, it is well on its way to becoming one, which is probably why the company is taking these arguments - and those who make them - more seriously. Amazon is reported to be in the market for an antitrust economist, and in the wake of the Whole Foods announcement, it has engaged the services of two former heads of the Justice Department antitrust division, one Democrat and one Republican. </p><p>I can't tell you exactly at what point the government should step in to block Amazon from buying another company or curtail some of its business practices. I am, however, fairly confident in saying that it ought to be well before Amazon achieves a 40 percent market share in books, groceries, clothing, hardware, electronics and home furnishings. And it ought to be before Amazon pulls even with UPS in shipping, Oracle in computing and Comcast in media content. Lina Khan's reasonable insight is that if we don't yet have the tools to identify when companies have reached that competitive tipping point, then someone ought to invent them.</p><p>And as for those \"bad old days\" when government officials still had the wisdom and the courage to call a monopolist a monopolist, let's remember it was the government's aborted prosecution of IBM, the most innovative and respected company of its day, that made Microsoft possible; the prosecution of Microsoft that made <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>possible; and the breakup of AT&amp;T that made Apple and wireless telephony possible. </p><p>\"<person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and every day they delivery enormously valuable products,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in a speech last month at New America. \"But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors that want their chance to change the world.\"</p><p>There is nothing in economic theory that makes it inevitable that successful disrupters will be disrupted. Indeed, what history demonstrates - and what a 28-year-old law student now reminds us - is that it sometimes takes a little public power to keep private power in check. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pearlstein@washpost.com\">pearlstein@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ff38b9ca722e11e79eacd56bd5568db8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P46-6F61-DXKP-J2J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3956\"/><timeReceived>6:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 28, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Among them is consumer goods giant Amazon (US:AMZN), which is facing criticism from the American Federal Trade Commission, House Judiciary Committee as well as the wrath of the European Union Commission. But to tighten their grip on Amazon, these regulators face a difficult battle. Current competition laws are designed to protect the consumer, meaning Amazon - which has pushed down prices, pioneered online shopping and made life easier for its millions of customers - is on the right side of regulation. As Lina Khan argues in her Yale Law Journal article 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox', to regulate the big tech companies, competition laws needs updating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In painstaking detail in the article, which catapulted Ms Khan from law student to 'Amazon's number one enemy', she argues that the antitrust laws drafted in the 1970s and 1980s are no longer appropriate for the modern market. She says they are designed to assess competition according to consumers' short-term interests, rather than the health of the market as a whole. Especially in the case of online platforms, antitrust laws should take into consideration the underlying structures and dynamics of markets.</p><p>Ms Khan writes that Amazon has established its dominance through two elements of its business strategy: integration across business lines and a willingness to lose money and invest aggressively. Both elements are aptly demonstrated by the $13-a-month Amazon Prime service, which offers customers free next-day delivery and access to the company's expanding content library. In 2011 it was estimated that each Prime member cost Amazon at least $90 (\u00a369.50) a year in lost shipping and film revenue, meaning the company lost $11 per customer annually. But Prime is considered crucial to Amazon's growth as an online retailer and it is estimated that customers increase their purchases from Amazon by around 150 per cent after they become Prime members. They also become more likely to buy from Amazon rather than other platforms. In this way, Amazon's strategy allowed it to use predatory pricing methods without drawing the attention of pricing laws.</p><p>The paper also identifies vertical integration as a way in which Amazon has established its market dominance. Vertical integration occurs when multiple successive stages of production or distribution of a product are brought under the same company. Take Fulfilment By Amazon (FBA), a service that gives online vendors access to Amazon's logistics system in exchange for a fee. Sellers who use FBA have an improved chance of being listed higher in Amazon search results than those who do not. This means that Amazon connects the success of the vendors that use its retail website to whether they also use its delivery system.</p><p>Comparable dynamics can also be found in Amazon's online infrastructure. As its Marketplace holds a large proportion of e-commerce traffic, many smaller merchants find that it is necessary to use the site in order to attract buyers. But Ms Khan cites evidence that Amazon uses its Marketplace as a testing ground to spot new products to sell itself. Using sales data from merchants in this way allows the company to bolster its own retail revenues without taking on extra risk. If products do well, Amazon sells them in-house but undercuts the pricing of existing vendors.</p><p>The problem facing regulators is that the current antitrust laws in the US and Europe don't deal with vertical integration, e-commerce platforms or predatory pricing. Ms Khan therefore proposes two approaches for addressing the dominance of Amazon and its peers: strengthen the law against predatory pricing and police forms of vertical integration that companies can use for anticompetitive practices.</p><p>She notes that while predatory pricing is technically illegal, it is hard to win claims because courts require evidence that the apparent predator would be able to raise prices as well as regain its losses. On the other hand, a competition-based approach could introduce the 'presumption of predation' - that is, courts could operate on the basis that an aggressive pricing strategy was being undertaken by dominant platforms that have already been found to be pricing products below cost.</p><p>The second proposal is that regulators should include a company's capacity to crossleverage data in merger review. At the time of the paper's publication, only mergers of a particular size required agency review - but in Ms Khan's view this may not be a true indicator of the scale of data at risk. If this had been the case, Facebook's (US:FB) purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram may have received greater scrutiny from antitrust agencies.</p><p>Ms Khan concludes that current law does not fully appreciate the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines can affect competition. This is perhaps most apparent in the context of online platforms such as Amazon - in part because platform markets often drive growth over profits, a strategy that investors have historically rewarded.</p><p>FURTHER READING \u00a6 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox', Lina M.

For many, it was not a cause for celebration - it was further evidence of the threat posed by the $863bn behemoth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On that same \"Cyber Monday\", warehouse workers in San Bernardino, California, where serious injuries run at four times the rate of the national average, picketed for better conditions. In Brussels, regulators from the European Commission joined politicians for a first-of-its-kind \"Amazon symposium\", where union leaders called for its break-up. In Rugeley, Staffordshire, Labour MP Jack Dromey demanded the Seattle giant stop acting like \"a 19th-century mill owner\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests were more than the scattered cries of a few angry people. They represent something deeper: a sharp, fundamental shift in sentiment against the company. It is still loved by consumers, perhaps more than ever, but regulators and politicians have turned against Amazon like never before. And if a Democrat wins America's election next year - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been vociferous critics - Amazon could face the fight of its life against a government intent on breaking it up.</p><p>Louis Hyman, economic historian at Cornell University in New York State, said: \"There's always one company that becomes the evil face of despotic capital. That's Amazon. There's this sense of its inevitable dominance of everything.\" The question is whether Amazon is any different from Standard Oil, Walmart or the A&amp;P Tea company, which dominated US retail from the 1920s to the 1970s.</p><p>Jon Nordmark, founder of consultancy Iterate.ai, said Jeff Bezos's empire was different. Amazon last year, he said, ploughed nearly $30bn (\u00a322.8bn) into R&amp;D - twice as much as Apple, and almost triple Facebook's outlay. That investment has gobbled up nearly all its $28bn in earnings before interest and expenses. The upshot is that Amazon pays little to no tax. Fair Tax Mark, an independent NGO, labelled it last week as the worst offender in Big Tech, claiming it had paid only $3.4bn in taxes in the past decade. That equates to just 12% of its already whittled-down profits. Nordmark said: \"They're using that $30bn basically to bankrupt all the people that don't do R&amp;D spending and pay their taxes.\"</p><p>Amazon took issue with the Fair Tax report: \"Amazon is doing the very thing governments encourage companies to do - paying all taxes due while also investing many billions in creating jobs and infrastructure.\"</p><p>It is simply doing it on a scale that none of its rivals touches. And given the breadth of Bezos's ambition, there is no reason to think this will ever change. What the billionaire has built is less a company than an astonishing ecosystem, gathering data from one corner of your life to offer you services in another.</p><p>Amazon is the biggest provider of cloud computing services.

For many, it was not a cause for celebration - it was further evidence of the threat posed by the $863bn behemoth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On that same \"Cyber Monday\", warehouse workers in San Bernardino, California, where serious injuries run at four times the rate of the national average, picketed for better conditions. In Brussels, regulators from the European Commission joined politicians for a first-of-its-kind \"Amazon symposium\", where union leaders called for its break-up. In Rugeley, Staffordshire, Labour MP Jack Dromey demanded the Seattle giant stop acting like \"a 19th-century mill owner\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests were more than the scattered cries of a few angry people. They represent something deeper: a sharp, fundamental shift in sentiment against the company. It is still loved by consumers, but regulators and politicians have turned against Amazon like never before. And if a Democrat enters the White House next year - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been strong critics - it could face the fight of its life against a government intent on breaking it up.</p><p>Louis Hyman, economic historian at Cornell University in New York State, said: \"There's always one company that becomes the evil face of despotic capital. That's Amazon. There's this sense of its inevitable dominance of everything.\" The question is whether Amazon is any different from Standard Oil, Walmart or the A&amp;P Tea company, which dominated US retail from the 1920s to the 1970s.</p><p>Jon Nordmark, founder of consultancy Iterate.ai, said Jeff Bezos's empire was different. Amazon last year, he said, put nearly $30bn (\u00a322.8bn) into R&amp;D - twice as much as Apple, and almost triple Facebook's outlay. That investment - Amazon said the $29bn it puts into \"technology and content\" is far broader than R&amp;D - has gobbled up virtually all its $28bn in earnings before interest and expenses, Nordmark said.</p><p>The upshot is that Amazon pays little to no tax. Fair Tax Mark, an independent NGO, labelled it last week as the worst offender in Big Tech, claiming it had paid only $3.4bn in taxes in the past decade. That equates to just 12% of its already whittled-down profits. Nordmark said: \"They're using that $30bn basically to bankrupt all the people that don't do R&amp;D spending and pay their taxes.\"</p><p>Amazon took issue with the Fair Tax report: \"Amazon is doing the very thing governments encourage companies to do - paying all taxes due while investing billions in creating jobs and infrastructure.\" It is simply doing it on a scale that none of its rivals touches. And given the breadth of Bezos's ambition, there is no reason to think this will ever change. What the billionaire has built is less a company than an astonishing ecosystem, gathering data from one corner of your life to offer you services in another.</p><p>Amazon is the biggest provider of cloud computing services. It runs an airline, a film studio, operates 500 grocery stores and employs hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers. Last week it started to stream Premier League matches; it also launched a medical transcription service that records and files conversations with your doctor as part of its assault on the $3 trillion healthcare market. It has tens of millions of listening devices and surveillance cameras in people's homes, and has formed hundreds of partnerships with police departments for access to home video footage.</p><p>Amazon employs some 7,000 artificial intelligence researchers.

For many, it was not a cause for celebration - it was further evidence of the threat posed by the $863bn behemoth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On that same \"Cyber Monday\", warehouse workers in San Bernardino, California, where serious injuries run at four times the rate of the national average, picketed for better conditions. In Brussels, regulators from the European Commission joined politicians for a first-of-its-kind \"Amazon symposium\", where union leaders called for its break-up. In Rugeley, Staffordshire, Labour MP Jack Dromey demanded the Seattle giant stop acting like \"a 19th-century mill owner\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests were more than the scattered cries of a few angry people. They represent something deeper: a sharp, fundamental shift in sentiment against the company. It is still loved by consumers, perhaps more than ever, but regulators and politicians have turned against Amazon like never before. And if a Democrat wins America's election next year - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been vociferous critics - Amazon could face the fight of its life against a government intent on breaking it up.</p><p>Louis Hyman, economic historian at Cornell University in New York State, said: \"There's always one company that becomes the evil face of despotic capital. That's Amazon. There's this sense of its inevitable dominance of everything.\" The question is whether Amazon is any different from Standard Oil, Walmart or the A&amp;P Tea company, which dominated US retail from the 1920s to the 1970s.</p><p>Jon Nordmark, founder of consultancy Iterate.ai, said Jeff Bezos's empire was different. Amazon last year, he said, ploughed nearly $30bn (\u00a322.8bn) into R&amp;D - twice as much as Apple, and almost triple Facebook's outlay. That investment has gobbled up nearly all its $28bn in earnings before interest and expenses. The upshot is that Amazon pays little to no tax. Fair Tax Mark, an independent NGO, labelled it last week as the worst offender in Big Tech, claiming it had paid only $3.4bn in taxes in the past decade. That equates to just 12% of its already whittled-down profits. Nordmark said: \"They're using that $30bn basically to bankrupt all the people that don't do R&amp;D spending and pay their taxes.\"</p><p>Amazon took issue with the Fair Tax report: \"Amazon is doing the very thing governments encourage companies to do - paying all taxes due while also investing many billions in creating jobs and infrastructure.\"</p><p>It is simply doing it on a scale that none of its rivals touches. And given the breadth of Bezos's ambition, there is no reason to think this will ever change. What the billionaire has built is less a company than an astonishing ecosystem, gathering data from one corner of your life to offer you services in another.</p><p>Amazon is the biggest provider of cloud computing services. It runs an airline, a film studio, operates 500 grocery stores and employs hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers. Last week it started to stream Premier League matches; it also launched a medical transcription service that records and files conversations with your doctor as part of its assault on the $3 trillion healthcare market. The company has tens of millions of listening devices and surveillance cameras sitting in people's homes, and has formed hundreds of partnerships with police departments for access to home video footage.</p><p>Amazon employs some 7,000 artificial intelligence researchers. It is the business equivalent of the Manhattan Project.</p><p>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that ahead of the presidential election, where the hollowing out of the middle class - and middle-class jobs - is a central issue, Amazon has become the bogeyman.</p><p>Hyman pointed to a 2017 JP Morgan study that found half of American middle-class families saw their monthly income fluctuate by up to 30%. In the bottom fifth, that proportion rose to 75%. He said: \"Just imagine the anxiety when your income goes up or down by 30% every month. Amazon is not what's wrong in society. It's not why income is unequal or pay-cheques are volatile. That all existed before the rise of Amazon as a major force in retail.\"</p><p>But Amazon, with its army of warehouse robots and relentless quest for more automation, has become the totem of iniquities of the modern economy. Its undoing could be the breakneck expansion of its logistics business: the warehouses, contract delivery drivers and pilots ensuring your packages arrive swiftly and safely. In three years, its workforce has nearly tripled from 230,000 to 650,000 as Bezos has cut out third-party suppliers and built a fulfilment colossus.</p><p>David Michaels, who, until 2017, ran America's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the government body that polices workplace safety, saw a sharp rise in violations at Amazon warehouses, where workers often stand in one spot to stack products onto an endless parade of robots. He said: \"If the robot controls your speed, and if you could lose your job if you don't keep up, you will do everything to keep up.\"</p><p>The GMB union says ambulances were called to Amazon's Rugeley warehouse 115 times in the past three years. Over the same period, a nearby Tesco warehouse made just eight calls. In America, it was found that contract drivers, under pressure to deliver parcels, had been involved in a rash of accidents, some of them fatal.</p><p>The company said: \"Amazon is a safe place to work,\" pointing to an injury rate it said was 40% lower than rival warehouse operations. Nordmark said: \"Amazon is attacking Fedex, Disney, Walmart, advertising companies, warehouse companies. It has a lot of enemies.\"</p><p>TRADE WAR FEARS GROW AS TAX NET SNARES BIG TECH Death and taxes: Jeff Bezos has been doing his best to avoid both. He has ploughed his wealth into longevity start-ups - and deployed all manner of accounting jujitsu to keep Amazon's tax bill low.</p><p>On the latter, however, authorities around the world are finally catching up. In April, Britain will impose a 2% tax on the money that Amazon and other Big Tech companies make from users on these shores. France imposed a 3% levy, retroactive to last year. Donald Trump has responded in kind to Paris's move, slapping tariffs on wine and other imports. He warned of more to come. Boris Johnson has vowed to push ahead with the tax plan, which begs the question of whether a much wider, more damaging trade war is on the cards.</p><p>The OECD group of top economies recently unveiled a new digital services tax, which it plans to impose by next month. America is vehemently opposed, saying it will hit US companies disproportionately.</p><p>Tech giants have long benefited from a tax system ill-prepared to deal with their businesses, which can collect vast sums in countries despite having little or no physical presence. That is about to change, and the repercussions could be profound. As his jousting with China, and now France, has shown, Trump has no compunction about launching trade wars.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amazon, run by Jeff Bezos, isincreasingly seen as a bogeyman</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-155484704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP4-SSM1-DYTY-C0H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CORNELL UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They were right, at least for a while, as the stock valuations of companies like AOL and Priceline soared way beyond anything that could conceivably be justified by current or future earnings. Of course after a while, price-to-earnings did come to matter, as the stock market lost half its value from its peak in March of 2000 to its trough in the summer of 2002. The tech heavy Nasdaq lost close to 80 percent of its value. Many of the big tech enthusiasts were wiped out in this crash. </p><p>While it might seem old-fashioned, people presumably value stock based on how much earnings a share commands, not the beauty of the stock certificate or how cool the company is. With this in mind, it is interesting to think about what the Amazon future might look like given that it now has a market capitalization of roughly $480 billion with current profits of roughly $2.6 billion. This gives it a price-to-earnings ratio of 184 to 1. Suppose we assume that ten years from now Amazon looks more like a normal company with modest growth potential, since at that point it will be thirty years old. This means it might have a price-to- earnings ratio closer to 20 to 1. This is still well above historic averages in the stock market, but we are plausibly in an era in which price-to-earnings ratios will be higher, and returns lower, than in prior decades. Let's assume that people expect a real return of 7.0 percent annually on their Amazon stock. This is the long-term average return in the stock market. While returns are likely to be somewhat lower going forward, it is reasonable to think that investors would expect a higher return on its stock than say GM or Walmart since Amazon is a fast-growing company and doesn't pay a dividend. This assumption implies that in ten years Amazon's market capitalization will be just under $980 billion, in today's dollars. If Amazon has a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 in 2027 then it will have after-tax profits of $49 billion in 2027. The Congressional Budget Office projects[2] that after-tax corporate profits in 2027 will be just under $1,400 billion (in 2017 dollars), which means that Amazon will be earning an amount roughly equal to 3.5 percent of all U.S. profits in 2027. There are three ways to get from its current profit level to the $49 billion it will need in 2027 to have a 20 to 1 PE ratio in that year. It can keep its current profit margin and have sales expand to a point where its profits are $49 billion. It can have its share of the market stay roughly constant, implying 2.0 percent annual growth, and have its profit margin increase, or it can have some combination of the two. In the first scenario its sales will have to expand to $2.44 trillion by 2027. This is shown in Figure 1 below . This implies that in 2027, Amazon's annual sales will be just a bit less than 10 percent of GDP. Since much of GDP involves areas like health care, rent, and education, areas in which Amazon does not currently have a presence, it would have to be an incredibly dominant actor in the segments of the market where it does operate. The other route would imply that Amazon sales will be $166 billion in 2027. From this volume of sales it must generate almost $49 billion in profits. This would imply that its profit margins would have to rise from 2.0 percent of sales at present to more than 29.0 percent of sales in 2027. This is shown in Figure 2 below.If Amazon were to hike its prices enough to achieve these margins it certainly would imply a very different shopping experience for its customers. Of course, there can be some mix between these two paths, but it seems unlikely that Amazon would be able to substantially increase its market share even as it is pushing up its profit margins. Amazon's Profits, without Amazon Web Services Amazon's main source of profits in the last few years has been its web service division. While this division accounts for just 9.0 percent of the company's revenue, it accounts for almost 75 percent of its profits. While it is possible that this division will continue to expand rapidly like the rest of the company, it is also possible that it will face serious constraints going forward. Amazon was able to get a huge head start in this market, jumping in ahead of other tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Now these companies are all making big pushes into this market. Let's imagine as one possibility that competition from these companies leaves Amazon's profits on its web service division unchanged in real terms over the next decade. This could mean that it either is forced to reduce margins substantially to maintain its share or it surrenders much of its share to its rivals, but keeps its margin in web services. Either way, this assumption would imply that the company must generate $46.6 billion in profits from its non-web services. Excluding web services, Amazon's current profits are equal to just 0.6 percent of sales. If the company is to generate $46.6 billion in profits in 2027 from its non-web services and keep its profit margins constant, then it will need sales of more than $7.4 trillion in 2027 (in 2017 dollars). This is shown in Figure 3 below.In this scenario Amazon's 2027 non-AWS revenue would be roughly equal to 30 percent of US GDP. The other extreme case is that sales just grow 2.0 percent a year and Amazon gets its $46.6 billion in non-AWS profits by increasing its profit margin. This scenario is only slightly different than the one shown in Figure 2 above, although the profit share on non-AWS sales would now have to be 30.4 percent instead of 29.5 percent. This is shown in Figure 4.Here we can also envision a mix of rising margins and rising sales, but it is difficult to see how this will get Amazon to $46.6 billion in profits on its non-AWS sales. Conclusion: Are Amazon Shareholders Suckers? Amazon has revolutionized the retail market and had an especially large impact in areas like publishing and now television. But that doesn't mean that its stock is necessarily a good buy. There are of course other factors that could make the picture somewhat better than these numbers indicate, most importantly its profit from the rest of the world, but it's not clear that would hugely change the picture. In Europe, Amazon is looking at a slow growing economy and a difficult regulatory environment. China is growing much more rapidly, but it is has very strong domestic competition, which the government is likely to favor in regulatory disputes. Other developing countries may offer better prospects, but it would take some very optimistic outcomes in these markets to hugely improve the picture. It may seem strange that sophisticated investors would have hundreds of billions of dollars in a hugely over-valued stock, but we have seen this before. After all, the shareholders of Time-Warner ended up selling one of the largest media companies in the world for almost nothing when they agreed to be taken over by AOL.com. The value of AOL.com stock quickly collapsed, and the value of the combined company was almost entirely based on Time-Warner's value. And it was only a decade ago that all the Wall Street geniuses thought that house prices could never fall. The mortgage backed securities that fueled the housing bubble all carried high investment grade ratings, as did Lehman and AIG. In short, any forecast on Amazon's future profitability has a huge element of uncertainty, but we should never rule out the possibility that its current investors are clueless.\u00a0View the discussion thread.[3] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/is-amazon-s-stock-price-justified-what-it-means-if-it-is#disqus_thread\">http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/is-amazon-s-stock-price-justified-what-it-means-if-it-is#disqus_thread</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/52370-outlook_0.pdf\">https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/52370-outlook_0.pdf</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ceprnet.disqus.com/?url=ref\">https://ceprnet.disqus.com/?url=ref</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CEPR1209811500477315032251761300100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CEPR-120981</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P28-KXD1-JCMN-Y1G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1345\"/><timeReceived>3:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Center for Economic and Policy Research</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 19, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>CEPR Blog</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The company is the second-largest retailer in the United States behind Walmart, and last year it became the second company in the world to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization. </p><p>Perhaps more significantly, it\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, with reams of data collected from an enormous customer base. Amazon has sold 100 million units of its voice assistant, Alexa, and an equal number of Prime subscriptions.  Amazon\u2019s runaway growth has prompted questions about whether it has become a massive monopoly that has unfairly edged out smaller competitors.  Wharton professor Barbara Kahn points out that subjecting big tech to antitrust laws, which take aim at monopolies that have pushed out competition, is different than enacting legislation to regulate that sector.  \u201cTypically, when you think about antitrust, you think about whether the consumer is worse off. And Amazon has been so far pretty clean on that,\u201d Kahn says, adding that Amazon hasn\u2019t lowered product quality or raised prices. The company also appears to be transparent with its customers.  However, more than half of American households now subscribe to Amazon Prime, so Amazon controls a massive amount of online shopping data in an asymmetric way against the competition.

This isn't necessarily illegal, or even unusual, but it is very tricky. The New York Times has a few insights into this mess[2] which need to be read to fully understand the depth of the problems. In essence, AWS, which is a very broad-based go-to Cloud service, is, of course, a huge player in Cloud software services. </p><p>The problem in some cases is that Amazon is alleged to have copied the software of their own clients, and used it to compete with them in providing services. (Note: The section in the NYT piece about Elasticsearch is indicative of the many issues and types of problems.)This situation is anything but simple. Others say that Amazon sales of the software and services that drive their revenue are destructive and competitive. The big picture is made of a lot of different small pictures, and you could be forgiven for feeling a bit lost when you see the multiple views on the open source story. One of the accusations against AWS is that it's starving startups of revenue. That's not at all trivial. Startups are vulnerable, like all new businesses. Their intellectual property is in many ways their working capital. If they're not getting enough out of their IP, it's a real problem. If a global giant corporation is somehow throwing spanners in the works, it's a worse problem. Fighting AWS is likely to be expensive, and worse, counterproductive and/or inconclusive. The startup Square One, a stable revenue stream, isn't helped by this situation. Legal issues, maybe, sorta, kinda, definitely, not, butThe predictable legal issues are likely to take on the size of a dictionary. This helps nobody, and the IP issues are truly huge. Strictly speaking, all software is subject to a type of theoretical IP rights. People can't just walk into your shop, steal the goods you made, and sell it in competition. Except this is 'open source', free software. The license and implied licenses are based on a very different perspective to commercial licenses. Only open source has this vagueness about IP. It's difficult to even comment on this virtual contradiction in terms without using up a lot of scatologies. You can see how uselessly convoluted this situation is. This is freely available software, gone profitable, so now who owns it? It's competing with itself in the market. The self-inflicted quandary for AmazonThere are other issues which are much less obvious and arguably own goals for everyone. AWS is a truly big umbrella. It has everything from standard Cloud services to security, real-time monitoring, quantum computing and more. Its market reach is astronomical. It's impossible to say if Amazon has breached any laws at all. You can call it very sharp practice, but not illegal until a court says it is. It's a very vague legal situation. That, ironically, isn't the most serious issue. Amazon as a group has a vested interest in a healthy, even hyper-healthy, software sector. Everything gets sold on Amazon. It makes no sense at all to hit developers with unworkable situations, particularly when it comes to revenue from their products. AWS operates in a huge money market. It generates billions. All these products are very high value. AWS is positioned to take a share in any new software which makes an impact in this gigantic market. Putting the developers on the spot, therefore, is like machinegunning every goose that lays a golden egg as a default action. The development process of any type of software is neither easy nor cheap. It can be time-consuming, and only the developers with their babies have that level of application to getting things working. (Excuse my mentioning how truly half-ass the corporate development programs can be, churning out things which barely run, etc. Semi-tested, barely operational crap isn't exactly unknown. Everyone's so meeting-addled that whatever finally comes out is the product, too bad if it doesn't do anything right or doesn't even run properly. That's hardly good enough for this high-end open source stuff, and lousy for future market purposes. That's why these top-level developers are so important.)Amazon is also perfectly positioned to partner with these exceptionally high-value developers. Instead of being the problem, it can definitely be the solution. It makes even less sense that it wouldn't, or doesn't in these cases. On a purely commercial license, partnership would be the natural, simple, default option for Amazon. So why not apply it to these very useful open source things? Commercially, it shores up the legals for both Amazon and the developers. The future is looking very regulatedUntil recently, the big tech companies have been more or less given a free hand. That's changing. The Federal Trades Commission (FTA) is now investigating anti-competitive practices[3], and that will definitely change the legal environment. Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft can expect regulation to come in sooner or later, either through litigation or through actual law. The problem with that is that it's quite likely to cause an expensive upheaval as working business practices have to jerk-start new compliance routines. The average working time for setting up a compliance framework that actually works is about a decade. It's quite expensive, and quite likely to shake the trees for fruit. The incoming legal liabilities could be anything. In the broader framework of business, as applied to industry dominance, social media, etc, etc, the regulatory environment can and probably will enter the open source debate, guns blazing. That may mean a major hit to the things that do work for open source at the moment, as well as the things that don't. Open source and its very much undervalued market In the midst of all this, the real value of open source to the market is being entirely overlooked. Open source is usually the introduction to new software. It's how people familiarize themselves with not only new software, but new concepts. It's the test bed, the learning tool, and the very useful, surprisingly valuable free sample. It's a truly lousy idea to undermine this extremely valuable market position. Nothing else has the market reach of free, useful stuff. It gets people interested. It's zero financial risk for users. It's popular. It will always be popular, and usually right up to speed with the current tech people want across the board. 'Almost' open source as a defence? If open source charges one dollar or one cent per year for itself, it becomes commercial property. It's better defended legally against any external use of itself, because it's turned into a defined commercial interest, including IP. It's hard to value free software. It's very easy to value anything with a currency symbol attached to it. Nobody could infringe on it without breaching IP rules. Let's clarify something here - Protecting the geese laying the golden eggs is far more important than a few bucks more for the big corporate guys. The corporate guys don't generate product; they enable it in the market. That's the way it should be. Without the developers, there is no product to sell, and maybe even no market. Amazon and the other Big Tech companies should be looking at preserving the sources and promoting them, not complicating something which should be simple.

Sanders was an Independent aligned with the Democrats, an outsider. He still is. Opponents have made it their pastime to paint him an extreme liberal as they ponder a likely Sanders presidency with trepidation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Varying degrees of liberalism separate the Democratic candidates this year. So what does the party stand for? The answers are not blowing in the wind, but Sanders derives support for being a life-long socialist who is willing to work within the constraints of a democracy.</p><p>Socialism drives his worldview, he has cast his lot with the people, not the state, and has emerged the Democratic frontrunner, with the Nevada caucuses confirming his lead over his uninspiring rivals.</p><p>The septuagenarian has rebranded himself a progressive for wider appeal among voters. In 2016, he could have been the perfect foe to counter the pseudo-conservative nationalist Trump, a Republican outsider. Sadly, a battle of the outsiders was not to be. It could happen this year if early Democratic primaries are any indication.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has morphed into America's most divisive president - for better or for worse is a matter of debate depending on which side of the political rift one is on. Four years ago, Sanders, after showing early promise, decided to yield ground to Hillary Clinton for some inexplicable reason. Clinton, the Democratic establishment's darling, was better funded and had the Clinton brand to back her. But Clinton's shock defeat to Trump rocked the Democratic centrist elite who looked far and wide for a bad actor guy and settled on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin basked in its new-found importance in American politics as Trump merrily made his way to the White House and stamped his mark with Trumpism.</p><p>The Democrats are seething, smarting from the loss of 2016 and are seeking vengeance, even if it means sacrificing their limited set of principles for the liberal billions on offer. And this makes Mike Bloomberg a more acceptable candidate than Sanders.</p><p>It's true that there was Russian interference online, on social media, but to doubt the intelligence of the average American voter is to mock the democratic process. The US intelligence community has again warned of Russian subterfuge ahead of this year's November polls, and the Democrats are chirpily turning on themselves by going after the only winnable candidate in their midst - Bernie Sanders. Putin wants him to emerge winner because he is easy meat for Trump, they claim. Baldergash!</p><p>I am convinced Sanders's ability to beat Trump in this year's election remains intact despite his age and heart condition (at 78, he will be the oldest American president if he gets elected). He's the best candidate the Democrats have got, yet they fail to put him in their sights. Sanders might have once been on the extreme Left once but he's still got the best shot at Trump and it's a shame the Dems are not letting him take it as they crowd around him in their bid to make him lose focus.</p><p>The Vermont senator is portrayed as an extreme Left rebel candidate by his party while he makes a serious attempt to move to the centre. To Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Oil, Sanders remains a free radical for his insistence on more regulation on their operations. To billionaires, he's the taxman with an axe to grind. He makes them uncomfortable with his calls for accountability and transparency in a rigged system that swing to the right during the Ronald Reagan presidency in the 1980s.</p><p>The Dems have been shackled and consumed by blind, and sometimes rabid liberalism while the GOP's confused conservatism threw them into ideological darkness.

(Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) The U.S. indictments against Huawei look set to significantly worsen already tense relations between China and the United States. As America pressures allies to drop Huawei and other Chinese firms, U.S. and European officials point to China's own laws as evidence that even private firms are potential arms of the Chinese state, and the political atmosphere grows colder in Beijing, the vision of a world brought together through technology feels ever more distant. Is tech the main battlefield in a new global struggle between two superpowers?</p><p> Are there any prospects for de-escalation? What will the indictments mean for the growth of Huawei and other major Chinese tech companies? \u2014The Editors Adam Segal,[1]Ira A. Lipman Chair in Emerging Technologies and National Security and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations Theunsealing[2]of two indictments by federal prosecutors on Jan. 28 against Huawei for bank fraud, sanctions violations, and theft of trade secrets suggests there is no turning back for Washington and Beijing in the conflict over the future of 5G. The two sides will struggle to manage the inevitable tensions that will come if and when Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is extradited from Canada. But even if cooler heads prevail over the appearance of Meng in a U.S. court, the argument that the United States has used with its friends and allies on why they should block Huawei from their own networks leaves no room for compromise.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.chinafile.com/This\">http://www.chinafile.com/This</url> article was originally published in ChinaFile.Without providing any evidence that Huawei equipment has backdoors or has been tampered with, U.S. officials have warned that allowing the company to be involved in thebuild-out[3]of 5G networks raises unmanageable security risks because of the nature of the technology and the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and technology companies. There will be huge amounts of data on 5G networks, both in the core and the periphery, and the equipment supplier will need to update software almost continuously, creating vulnerabilities not present in third- and fourth-generation networks. This means the buyer has to trust the supplier, and officials have argued that this is impossible when the supplier is a company that comes from a system where the party can demand that firms follow its political needs over their own economic interests. These structural issues cannot be addressed with third-party inspections or greater transparency. This breaking of the 5G ecosystem into competing spheres of influence raises two questions. First, what will the impact be on the pace of innovation? In the short term, at least, it is likely to slow the deployment of 5G in the United States. High-tech companies, including Qualcomm, Intel, and Apple, have argued that the trade dispute could slow down the development of 5G in the United States. Longer-term, the conflict is already spurring greater government support for science and technology from both Washington and Beijing. Second, how does the rest of the world divide? U.S. security partners can, for the most part, be expected to follow Washington's lead, although there remaindissenting voices[4]in places like France and Germany. The rest of the world, especially developing economies, may not find Huawei so threatening. Many policymakers around the world probably believe there is little they can do to stop being spied on by both Chinese and U.S. intelligence agencies, and given that reality, they might as well benefit from cheap, reliable Huawei equipment. Samm Sacks,[5]cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at New America The United States and China are locked in a deepening conflict over technology. But this is much bigger than the arrest of Meng Wanzhou and even Huawei itself. A perfect storm is brewing in Washington and Beijing. The Trump administration has launched a campaign to confront China over intellectual property theft, economic cyberespionage, technology transfer, and market access. These are challenges that have vexed U.S. policymakers and the business community for years, but now there is a whole-of-government approach: a strengthened Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States review process combined with a newexport control regime[6]to restrict transfers of emerging technologies to China. A new Justice Departmentinitiative[7]gives law enforcement a green light to aggressively pursue criminal cases involving Chinese companies or individuals. Thecase[8]of Fujian Jinhua marked anew U.S. strategy[9]in which intellectual property theft becomes a national security risk when it involves technology in the U.S. defense industrial base. The controversialBloomberg hack story[10]from the fall fueled sentiment that U.S. companies should unwind supply chains with China. Washington is pressuring allies and partners around the world to ban Huawei from 5G networks. In Beijing, Xi Jinping's administration is doubling down on plans to boost China's self-reliance in 'core technology[11],' while expanding state support across strategic manufacturing sectors. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is building out the most comprehensive cybersecurity regulatory system in the world to expand government control over supply chains, critical information infrastructure, and data. Hundreds of cybersecurity standards could make it more difficult for Western companies to operate in China, including one creating new channels for Beijing to require source code in order to do business. We may be headed toward what looks like a 'Digital Iron Curtain' in 2019, where governments around the world face a choice between doing business with China or with the United States. Even if Meng were released or a superficial trade deal were reached, it is not likely that there will be a change of course. The challenge is made even more difficult because the public is having trouble keeping track of different threads at play. Many cited the details contained in the indictment as the long-awaited evidence that shows Huawei spies for Beijing and therefore must be banned from 5G networks globally. But the indictment, while it offers damning details of fraud and trade secret theft, provides no evidence of espionage. According tothe Economist,banning a firm[12]on 'the say-so of American officials, without evidence of spying, would set a dangerous precedent.' The facts matter because thestakes of confrontation[13]between the United States and China are so high. There are steepcosts[14]to decoupling given the integrated nature of technology, research, and manufacturing around the world. Losing visibility into Chinese developments in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, and especially China's plans to write standards for artificial intelligencesafety and ethics[15], would be even more dangerous to U.S. interests.Cobus van Staden,[16]Co-Host of the 'China in Africa' podcast The Huawei case raises the basic truth that Chinese low-cost manufacturing and assemblyhave been central[17]to the global success of U.S. tech companies. The global rollout of devices like the iPhone has been supported by the massive manufacturing output of companies like Huawei. From the perspective of the developing world, the current conflict between the U.S. government and Huawei has as much to do with development as it does security. For example, several tech commentators in South Africa havecharacterized[18]the conflict as a U.S. attempt to claw back market share from a developing world competitor that has managed to make components that work, for cheaper. Huawei's combination of low prices and high quality has made it a favorite in Africa, not least because both Huawei and ZTE are favored implementation partners in projects funded by Chinese state lenders. Huawei has reportedlybuilt[19]at least 50 3G networks in 36 African countries and hasimplemented[20]70 percent of the continent's 4G networks. Huawei, ZTE, and other Chinese tech companies are involved in everything from new undersea internet cables and national data networks to selling millions of mobile phones to Africans\u2014a market long ignored by U.S. tech giants. If the tech cold war comes down to a choice between the Chinese and American internets, Africa's choice has been made\u2014at least in terms of hardware. Africa's current internet boom is in significant part due to Chinese components and funding. As Huawei is frozen out of markets in the developed world, it might well find warm reception in Africa. This is not necessarily because Africans don't care about surveillance but because for a younger generation, development trumps other concerns. After all, despite the new BUILD Act, neither the Trump administration nor U.S. tech giants are falling over themselves to fund or build networks across Africa. Young Africans are hungry for connectivity, and Huawei is willing to connect them. This doesn't mean that Africa is indifferent to security breaches and surveillance. However, from the perspective of the developing world, the difference between the West and China is maybe not as clear-cut. While there are indications that authoritarian African governments are importing Chinese tech for surveillance purposes, Human Rights Watch hasimplicated[21]both Western and Chinese firms in facilitating Ethiopian surveillance as far back as 2014. This is exacerbated by the increasing blurring of the border between tech capitalism and national security on both sides of the Pacific. David Samuels recentlypointed out[22]in Wired that while China's surveillance state and itssocial credit system[23]seem dystopian by Western standards, Western consumers undergo similar levels of commercial surveillance by tech companies. He also noted that the traditional border between the commercial tech world and the government's security apparatus is rapidly shrinking in the United States. Security is important, but Africa is still struggling to get itself fully online. This takes lots of funding and lots of cheap, sturdy components. In Africa, the real issue is who except Chinese companies like Huawei can do this work? Elsa Kania,[24]Adjunct Fellow, Center for a New American Security None of Huawei's recent troubles should be surprising to those familiar with the company's history, which has been riddled with controversy, including apparentcorrupt practices[25]and connection toincidents of hacking[26]. But the details of the indictments are startling nonetheless. Given the relative impunity Huawei has enjoyed and the brazenness of its behavior, these charges and indictments are entirely fair for the United States to pursue. However, the timing of these actions has raised concerns of politicization. The Chinese government, for instance, hascharacterized[27]these charges as 'unreasonable suppression' of the company. The concerns should also extend far beyond Huawei itself to deeper systemic challenges. These are not unique to Huawei but involve the legal and extralegal demands that all Chinese companies must face. In particular, China's National Intelligence Lawdeclares[28], 'an organization or citizen shall support, assist in and cooperate in national intelligence work,' as well as conceal intelligence activities of which it is aware. This legal coating might even be considered superfluous, given the many other opaque mechanisms through which the Chinese Communist Party exerts control. Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, hasdenied[29]that he has received requests to share 'improper information' and has said his company 'would not answer to such requests.' Although his apparent commitment to his clients is laudable, it may also be irrelevant. There are reasons to be quite skeptical (at the least) that Huawei would be able to resist such a demand. The party has made it clear that tech companies, no matter how successful and entrepreneurial, will remain subject to party control. The criticisms of decisions to ban Huawei often point out that there is no 'smoking gun' or evidence that incontrovertibly demonstrates that Huawei is guilty of a specific offense. But unlike the specific allegations of fraud against Meng, this is not a legal issue but rather a question of risk calculus that must be informed by the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping hasdeclared[30]quite explicitly: 'The party leads everything.' Evaluations of risk are inextricable from geopolitical considerations. Not every country has the same reasons to be fearful of Chinese targeting that the U.S. does. Huawei's 5G offerings remain attractive to many countries that recognize the benefits of partnerships enabling greater connectivity. But for the U.S., the potential for sabotage in a crisis or conflict scenario are very real concerns, given that Chinese strategists have long looked for ways to achieve asymmetric advantage against a powerful potential adversary. There will be costs to excluding Huawei, including slowing the deployment and increasing the costliness of 5G. However, despite all the talk of a race for 5G, security and resilience may matter much more in the long term than speed. The U.S. government is right to anticipate and evaluate the potential negative externalities from Huawei's aspirations of dominance in 5G, but the same concerns are equally applicable to any number of Chinese companies that have operated in the United States and globally with less scrutiny\u2014and infamy\u2014to date. Elliott Zaagman,[31]Co-Host of 'China Tech Investor' It's hard to foresee any way that the situation could improve in the short term. There are, however, any number of ways that we could see it deteriorating further. Some criticisms of America's multipronged attack on Huawei do seem valid. The evidence of Huawei equipment being used to spy for Beijing is shaky, and U.S. President Donald Trump's apparent willingness to use Meng Wanzhou as a bargaining chip is at best an idiotic misstep and at worst a gross violation of the rule of law. But, on a number of different levels, the campaign against Huawei makes sense. In the intensifying battle between the United States and China over cybersecurity, 5G, and global tech supremacy, Huawei is a key piece on the chessboard. What is perhaps equally important is the symbolic meaning of Huawei and its practices, and the significance that plays in the emerging clash of cultures, systems, and civilizations between China and the nebulous entity often referred to as 'the West.' Counter to the expectations of many Americans and their allies, over the better part of the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party has seemed to move toward greater authoritarianism, more brutal tactics of repression, and a society, economy, and internet that are increasingly cut off from the rest of the world. Even as it closes itself off internally, China is expanding its global presence and encouraging its companies to expand abroad. Rather than integrating itself with the U.S.-led global community, China seems intent on going its own direction, setting up a conflict over the interests and values that are to govern the global order. Huawei, in many ways, is an embodiment of this approach. It is one of the world's largest telecommunications firms, with apresence[32]in 170 countries worldwide, yet its internal culture does not reflect that global standing. It is not a publicly traded company, and its executive and supervisory boards are all Chinese nationals, with at least 20 years at the company. On the company website, none of Huawei's top executives even lists a foreign university degree. The company's intense and highly opaque 'wolf culture[33]' also breeds mistrust both within the company and with the public. The laserlike focus on achieving a goal by any means necessary is credited as a reason for the company's success but can also seem to encourage disregard for the law. Overseas, Huawei has long faced complaints of labor law violations, corruption, and intellectual property theft. The U.S. indictment'sclaim[34] that the company had a formal program offering rewards to employees who stole intellectual property only compounds long-circulating rumors. The courts will decide whether Huawei and Meng are guilty. Yet, the increased scrutiny will damn them in the court of public opinion. Foreign governments, businesses, and consumers will have to decide if Huawei is worthy of their trust. Huawei, and China as a whole, will need to decide whether the benefits of their approach to business are worth the rapidly increasing costs.

(Bettmann via Getty Images) My father always told me that all businessmen were sons of bitches,' John F. Kennedy once griped, 'but I never believed it until now!' The young president recalled this pearl of wisdom in 1962, when the industrial giant US Steel announced its plans to raise prices, despite months of campaigning by the White House against such an increase. Steel was central to the US economy: The new highway system, the vast war machine, the automobiles and the oil pipelines that fed them were all made from it. </p><p>If steel prices went up, all prices went up, threatening an inflationary spiral. Both Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower had sought to avert this, and Kennedy was no different, making a public show of leaning on US Steel to keep its prices down. But the steel industry was determined to get its way. Under pressure from organized workers demanding higher wages, it felt that it had very little choice.1 Ad Policy[1] Books in Review  The 1960s are often remembered as the last decade of the golden age of egalitarian, high-growth capitalism. The New Deal reforms of the 1930s had something to do with this postwar boom, but so did the corporate structure and market position of the giant, vertically integrated industrial corporations like US Steel. In response to organized labor's challenge, they were able to provide one of the great downward redistributions of income in the history of modern capitalism. These companies could afford to do so, in part, because they enjoyed limited competition in their coordinated, oligopolistic markets. The US government had dismantled the formal price-control system under pressure from manufacturers in 1946, and so it relied to a large degree on informal mechanisms (so-called jawboning) to hold down prices, often by inserting itself into collective bargaining processes in consolidated markets like steel and autos. Major American steel firms, for example, bargained jointly with the United Steelworkers of America\u2014an affair of such economic significance that it spilled out of the private sector and repeatedly became a public matter. Contract after contract would wind up being settled in the White House. Whoever was president found that he could not afford the havoc of a protracted nationwide steel shutdown and so felt enormous pressure to deliver a victory to the steelworkers' union. But the White House also could not tolerate increases in the price of steel, which were the employers' device to pay for a union victory. So a tripartite bargain was struck whose purpose (for the government) was to restrain wage and price growth enough to limit inflation, but not so much as to leave workers dissatisfied.2 When business, labor, and government come together to determine how much goods would cost and workers would be paid, the result can hardly be described as a market process. The postwar years of the 1950s and '60s were the age of 'monopoly capitalism,' as the Marxists then called it, or, less polemically, an era of 'administered prices.' The cartelization of American industry had its negative effects, including the technological stagnation of US manufacturing and the irresistible rise of inflation, culminating in the chaotic 1970s. But in any case, it served many American workers well and, at least for a time, helped produce a more egalitarian country. But when it finally came crashing down, it took working-class incomes with it\u2014a disaster from which we have yet to recover.3 In recent years, however, a different account of the origin and nature of economic inequality has become popular in some quarters. Dubbed the new antitrust or new Brandeisianism (after Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who laid the intellectual foundation for vigorous market reform), this approach offers a distinctive, simple, and insistent diagnosis of economic polarization. Rather than emphasize the punitive turn of social welfare programs, the loss of union density, and the underlying structural pressures on employers to suppress wages, it instead argues that equality was undermined by the renascence of monopoly power. Monopolies today need not swallow a whole supply chain into a single corporation; instead, they work when a large firm dominates smaller ones, dictating to them without needing to own them. Astride their respective economic sectors, tech companies control our minds, retail giants like Amazon and Walmart enforce terms of production on suppliers and terms of purchase on consumers, and Wall Street firms extract a punishing toll from every movement of money and suck value from the whole economy. Together, they are eroding the integrity of our political and economic systems.4 In his new book, Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, Matt Stoller, one of the most irrepressible members of this new generation of Brandeisians, elevates this argument to something like a theory of history. For Stoller, all of American history\u2014and much of world history\u2014has been defined by a struggle between monopoly and democracy. Where property is concentrated, its owners warp the public institutions that exist around them, allowing them to concentrate property still more. At the extreme ends of this quantitative process, the monopolist captures the state itself, with sovereignty a mere trapping of consolidated market power in the hands of a feudal lord or fascist dictator.5 Over the history of the United States, Stoller finds the greatest nemesis of such authoritarian pretensions in America's anti-monopoly tradition. For him, anti-monopoly is fundamental to the fabric of American democracy. It began with the American Revolution (which he describes as a revolt against the monopoly privileges of British merchants), gained a mass following with Jefferson, became radicalized with the Populists in the late 19th century, tasted power with the Progressives, and culminated in the New Deal and the mid-20th-century US economy. Minimizing the centrality of corporatist coordination to that era, Stoller insists that the New Deal was fundamentally an antitrust program. Its vigorous regulators broke the power that the robber barons accumulated in the 19th century and drove the moneychangers from the temple of democracy, thereby ushering in a golden age of competition and freedom\u2014until this agenda was undermined by scurrilous and arrogant schemers in both parties, who opened the way for a massive reassertion of corporate power beginning in the 1970s.6 What's so telling about this narrative is not only the fact that the golden age of competition that Stoller wishes to restore is the very same period in which great, vertically integrated oligopolies ruled the economy in coordination with one another, labor unions, and the state; it is also that his expansive view of economic power still can't find a place for class conflict\u2014which, although invisible to Stoller, was often the engine of downward redistribution in the midcentury boom. Because he does not grasp how the fundamental antagonism between labor and capital underlies other forms of economic rivalry, Stoller misunderstands the nature of the New Deal and the legacy it leaves us. As a result, his book offers us a useful guide to some of the ills of concentrated market power today but does not ultimately come to terms with their real origin or present any viable political response.7  Related Article Stoller initially gained some prominence in the early 2000s as a member of the cohort of progressive political bloggers who found their voice in the early years of the Iraq War. Stoller at first supported the war, but he soon became horrified by how the Democratic establishment rolled over for the agenda of George W. Bush's administration, and he and a set of his peers\u2014writers like Matt Yglesias, Ezra Klein, and Markos Moulitsas\u2014helped mobilize support for progressive reforms and the Democrats who championed them.8 Although Stoller continued to see himself as an outsider in the years after Barack Obama's election, he, like the other members of this cohort, joined the intellectual and political ranks of the DC machine and managed to establish their careers before the Great Recession started in 2008. Moulitsas, the founder of the website Daily Kos, became an unofficial Democratic Party operative. Klein and Yglesias emerged as celebrated policy journalists, eventually launching the mammoth operation at Vox. By the end of the decade, Stoller, for his part, was working as an economic policy staffer in Congress. From this perch, he watched with dismay as the Obama White House did little to break from the prevailing economic consensus. With Clinton administration veterans Larry Summers, Rahm Emanuel, and Timothy Geithner back in power, Obama and his team of economic advisers sided with the lords of finance, directing unimaginable streams of money to shore up Wall Street while letting millions of Americans lose their homes to foreclosure.9 This marked a second phase in Stoller's politicization. 'It seemed clear to many of us during the bailouts,' he notes in Goliath, 'that the public would turn vehemently against the political establishment for taking their property, their stake in America, and so it has.' Stoller left Capitol Hill and fell into the orbit of the anti-monopoly thinkers and activists affiliated with the New America Foundation, particularly journalist Barry Lynn, whose 2009 book Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction argued that hidden monopolies have insinuated themselves throughout our economy. For Stoller and this emerging anti-monopoly clique, the betrayal that took place after 2008 had a much longer history. In the 1970s, an affluent faction of Democrats helped kill the party's 'populist soul.'10 Stoller began to formulate this thesis in historical terms in a widely shared essay that appeared in The Atlantic shortly before Trump won the 2016 election. Historians like Judith Stein and Lily Geismer told versions of this story before, arguing that in the 1970s middle-class professionals wrested control of the Democratic Party away from its blue-collar social base and unleashed a set of market-centric reforms and deregulatory schemes. But Stoller offers a somewhat different analysis: The transformation that these middle-class professionals helped to enact tilted the balance of class power, in his view, because it allowed the advance of market concentration. And he tells this story primarily through the perspective of Wright Patman, a Democratic congressman from rural East Texas, a 'proud Hillbilly' and dogged foe of market consolidation and financial power. As Stoller announces early in Goliath, he sees this history 'through [Patman's] eyes.' In his telling, Democrats lost their way when the yuppie progressives often called the 'Watergate Babies' swept into power in 1974 and ousted Patman from his Banking Committee chairmanship, with grave consequences. 'The destruction of the anti-monopoly and anti-bank tradition in the Democratic Party,' Stoller writes, 'has also cleared the way for the greatest concentration of economic power in a century.'11 In Goliath, he retells the story of Patman and the fall of the New Deal Democratic Party. But Stoller also aspires to something far grander. He insists that almost all of American history can be understood in terms of the struggle between the forces of monopoly on the one hand and democracy on the other, beginning with the feud between the aristocratic Alexander Hamilton and the democratic Thomas Jefferson and extending into the 20th century, with the rise of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, tribunes of the people in the age of mass democracy. (Glossed over or ignored outright here are the central roles in the Jeffersonian popular tradition of gnocidaire Andrew Jackson and of pro-slavery politics.) It is, in fact, with Wilson that Goliath opens in earnest, with his campaign for the presidency in 1912, when he faced off against Theodore Roosevelt (as well as William Howard Taft and Eugene Debs) over the question of what was to be done about the accumulation of economic power in the hands of the few. Railroad and coal barons mutilated their workers in spectacular workplace horrors, while bankers lorded it over society like European aristocrats. 'We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!' Roosevelt declared, and for him, this battle required introducing a corporatist system that regulated but did not break up the new industrial giants. For Wilson, who embraced the ideas of Brandeis, it meant splitting them up\u2014what he called a 'New Freedom.'12 In Stoller's rendering of this story, Wilson attempted to launch something like a New Deal and might have pulled it off if World War I hadn't gotten in the way. But America's entrance into the war in 1917 and the economic chaos and reactionary politics that it unleashed allowed the reassertion of power by the forces of monopoly. 'Wilson, so energetic at the beginning of his term,' Stoller writes, 'could do nothing by the end of his tenure except lie in bed as his administration jailed thousands of innocents, and as the plutocrats swiftly subverted the new order he had imposed just a few years earlier.' Apparently, the Wilson administration's reform agenda rested on the vision and energy of but a single figure, and his physical decline brought the New Freedom down with it. The egalitarian ambitions of Wilson and the anti-monopoly tradition would have to be put on hold as Andrew Mellon, the last of the great robber barons, rose to power and, as secretary of the treasury, unleashed the oligarchic forces of the 1920s. Wealth accumulated at the top, while the common people suffered\u2014a regime Stoller calls 'Mellonism.'13  With the Depression, agency in the narrative shifts again, from Mellon and his accomplices to a new generation of anti-monopolists, including many in Franklin Roosevelt's brain trust and, of course, Wright Patman, Stoller's East Texas hero. Patman arrived in Washington in 1929, the year of the crash, and almost immediately set about bird-dogging Mellon. Patman supported the marchers of the Bonus Army, advocated cheap credit for farmers, and wrote with Arkansas Senator Joe Robinson a landmark anti-monopoly bill in 1936 that barred predatory pricing in retail.14  Related Article A beneficiary of the South's racist one-party system, Patman may have been a champion of economic competition, but he also spent decades in power without much political competition, accruing seniority and rising to the chairmanship of the Banking Committee. (This was the reason he drew the ire of the Watergate Babies in 1975; they wanted to eject the Southerners from their powerful sinecures.) Stoller unconvincingly suggests his great man was only as racist as he was obliged to be politically and was appreciated by his black constituents, even if Patman was, after all, one of only five Texas Democrats in the House to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto denouncing the Brown v. Board of Education decision. (Seventeen refused.)15 One wishes Stoller had paused to contemplate why anti-monopoly tended to find its most vigorous advocates in white Southerners like Wilson, Robinson, and Patman. He suggests this is merely a coincidence and that there existed no historical relationship between white supremacy and pro-competitive politics. In part, this is because Stoller really is interested only in telling us how the relentlessly populist Patman's advocacy helped shape the New Deal. 'Patman brought forward what the farmers of the 1890s demanded of their society, a democracy with an egalitarian system of free enterprise, where small business had the same shot as Andrew Mellon to compete. He stood up to Mellon. He stood for the plain people, and the veterans. And in doing so, he destroyed the legitimacy of the plutocrats that dominated America.' Summarizing the emerging egalitarian era, Stoller observes, 'Finally, after the second great war of the century, democracy had taken hold in the commercial sphere.'16 If this doesn't match your idea of the origins of the New Deal era, you're not alone. Wishing anti-monopoly to be a politics for all times and places, Stoller cannot allow it any historical specificity. He does not satisfactorily wrestle with the fact that Patman and his antitrust attorney allies formed only one part of the New Deal coalition. Anti-monopoly was a part of a much larger political spectrum, which also included corporatism of just the kind Stoller abhors. Distinguishing among these elements is possible, and one can argue that one is preferable to the other. But doing so would also require acknowledging the existence and logic of another dimension of the New Deal beyond antitrust and corporatism\u2014and that would mean considering labor and class.17 In Goliath's second half, Stoller gives us his story of how the New Deal's anti-monopoly democracy was unmade. Some of the beats are familiar: His narrative dwells on the rise of the Chicago School of economics\u2014what Stoller calls 'the new Mellonism'\u2014where American antitrust law was reinvented by characters like law professor Aaron Director, economist George Stigler, and jurist Robert Bork. The result was the law and economics movement, which played an enormous role in changing doctrine in general and elevating the significance of consumer welfare in particular. These thinkers constructed a consumer welfare standard for antitrust cases that didn't necessarily focus on big or small but rather cheap and thus became the cover under which market power reasserted itself. (Whatever else Amazon is, it is cheap and convenient for the consumer.)18 But the Chicago School neoliberals and the politicians and judges they influenced were given valuable cover, Stoller argues, by intellectuals on the left, who saw in large-scale economic concentration the basis of a social order beyond capitalism\u2014and saw in populism only backward-looking reaction. Stoller reserves pages of bizarre vitriol here for sociologist C. Wright Mills, historian Richard Hofstadter, and economist John Kenneth Galbraith, whom he blames for eroding the ideological basis of antitrust in the postwar years. 'Hofstadter and Galbraith together,' he tells us in a puzzling passage, 'created a new language and new frame of analysis designed to eliminate the antimonopoly tradition in American politics. A new villain, the grubby racist small businessman, had replaced the money trust.' As Stoller concludes later on, ''Beautiful smugness' is how John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter persuaded a generation to give up their liberties.' Even if Stoller's readings of these thinkers represented them accurately, this would seem an awfully large role to assign to a sociologist, a historian, and an economist\u2014even unusually prominent ones.19 While neoliberalism germinated in Chicago and smug intellectuals fulminated in New York, finance regrouped. 'Set free from their wartime constraints, and then from the constraints imposed by White House control over the Fed, bankers tried to seize more power,' Stoller writes, and financiers like Citibank chief Walter Wriston and conglomerate mogul Saul Steinberg invented financial tools to manipulate the market\u2014including the certificate of deposit, a bondlike instrument that allowed Citibank to evade regulations meant to limit bank size. When Patman came after these bankers, his success was mixed; they had learned from the experience of the 1930s. Stoller writes:20  Wriston didn't appear as a robber baron, but a cosmopolitan executive who believed in racial tolerance, liked rock 'n' roll, and wanted to be a responsible business leader in a technologically advanced society. Citibank, as he told governors and local politicians, didn't pollute, and it went without mention that the bank didn't send soldiers to Vietnam.21 Perceiving an intersection between a fashionable cultural progressivism born out of the 1960s and a renascent economic oligarchy, Stoller continues, affluent, snobby liberals teamed up with bankers against the American people. By the early 1970s, everyone from Ralph Nader and the Watergate Babies to enlightened bankers and Chicago School economists were working together to bring the curtain down on economic democracy. With Patman ousted in 1975, Jimmy Carter deregulating key markets shortly thereafter, and Democrats taking up the Chicago School's ideas, corporate power took off. Unshackled from regulatory constraints, big-box retail spread across small-town America, while banks and more exotic financial firms began to reassert themselves, growing in size and power. From there, Stoller offers us a straight line to the election of Trump, who fed on the democratic decay that set in once the regulatory state had been dismantled. As Stoller puts it in his Atlantic essay, 'The story of Patman's ousting is part of the larger story of how the Democratic Party helped to create today's shockingly disillusioned and sullen public, a large chunk of whom is now marching for Donald Trump.'22 In this respect, Goliath is an ambitious and risky undertaking that proffers a century-long narrative encompassing virtually every aspect of American political and economic life. But Stoller tends to tell his story from the perspective of individual politicians, intellectuals, and millionaires\u2014Patman, Wilson, Brandeis, Mellon, and the like. Structural forces recede, personalities grow in importance, and it becomes difficult to tell why anything is happening.23 For this reason, great changes that Stoller would like to trace tend to go unexplained except in terms of the greed and corruption, or farsightedness and altruism, of particular individuals. Wilson's Federal Reserve, for example, was a good idea\u2014'designed to move power over the economy from Wall Street to the people'\u2014until it fell into the hands of 'shortsighted private bankers who could not or would not stop speculative bubbles.' (Why? How?) The defeat of Wilson's ostensibly benevolent peace plan is also attributed to the machinations of robber barons. '[Henry Clay] Frick and Mellon believed that America should use its power solely to enhance American financial interests, not to engage in some scheme for world peace. The two men saw opposition to the [Treaty of Versailles] as a way to discredit the Democrats and drive them from power.' Mellon then became the most powerful man in the country\u2014'King Andrew'\u2014setting the stage in turn for the stock market crash of 1929. Everything in this narrative is about market power, and market power is about greed and opportunity.24 Yet when one attempts to peer beneath this layer of individual action, avaricious or heroic, Stoller's narrative begins to unravel. In order to conjure up a united front of the common people against corporate power, he repeatedly collapses the distinction between the problem of monopoly and the problem of class. Again and again, he cites capital's offenses against labor as evidence of the need for anti-monopoly measures, writing phrases like 'small businessman and blue-collar worker' as if the reader will not notice he has named two separate things.25 Stoller isn't wrong in asserting that there were many working-class people invested in breaking the power of the robber barons, but anti-monopoly as it emerged as a mass movement in the late 19thcentury was only one component of what was often called 'the social question,' or if you were less inclined to euphemism, 'the labor question.' To be sure, agrarian rebels demanded the death of the money power, while huge strike waves shook the country in 1877 and again in 1886, developing into general strikes in multiple cities. The United States saw repeated instances of workers shutting down large sections of the nation's rail network in wild, out-of-control confrontations. Gun battles between unions and company thugs became more and more common, as in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892 and Cripple Creek, Colorado, in 1894. But at issue in these labor conflicts was not just the cartelization of the economy but the whole system of relationships that made up America's social order, in particular the 'wages system'\u2014that is, capitalist labor markets\u2014and its bouts of wage cuts and unemployment. When workers in these struggles denounced monopolies, they often did so because they viewed concentrated capital as part of a deeper problem: capitalism itself. They struck because industrial wage labor was a new form of domination, and they wished to diminish and eventually end it.26 For Stoller, however, inequality and the class tensions it unleashed are made not inside the process of production but in the 'commercial sphere.' Industry and commerce, however, are obviously not the same thing, and this conflation leads him to serious conceptual problems. The political issues that arise from production occur between labor and capital\u2014over wages, hours, safety, unionization, workers' control, and so on\u2014and are quite distinct from conflicts over market power, which occur between capital and capital and, as the legal scholar Lina Khan put it, concern 'product quality, variety and innovation' as well as prices. The two are related to each other, as when labor markets take on monopsonistic characteristics, but they remain distinct. Yet wherever he looks, Stoller sees the two spheres as one and accordingly vexed by the same question: what to do about the robber barons\u2014which is to say, the issue of concentration at the top. Social inequality, the relationship between the classes, and the maldistribution of economic and political power are all collapsed into a question of the bigness and badness of the biggest, baddest members of the elite.27 He is also correct in asserting that anti-monopoly sentiment has enjoyed a large social base in American history, but it was not among 'the people' in general and certainly not the working class in particular. Rather, it was a politics that arose among several distinct social and economic groups as they came under increasing economic pressure around the turn of the 20th century and settled on trust-busting as the instrument of their relief. They were not all of one kind. There were farmers and craftsmen, shopkeepers and small businessmen, spread out across small towns and the countryside. These groups linked up with Progressive lawyers and professionals in the first third of the 20th century\u2014especially those influenced by Brandeis\u2014who believed that market regulation could limit the power of corporations in order to produce a stable, harmonious social order.28  Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/january-27-2020-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/january-27-2020-issue/</url> Yet since Stoller takes as a given that anti-monopoly populists speak on behalf of the people as an organic whole, he presents Patman and the antitrust activists in the New Deal as the entirety of that project's egalitarian thrust. Invisible in his account is the Northern social democratic politics of millions of working-class Americans that\u2014I think I'm on safe ground here\u2014was also quite influential in shaping that era's policies. Whether or not you rate antitrust as important, it still beggars belief to see it as a more significant force in the remaking of American society in the 1930s than the insurgency of millions of industrial workers and the wave of reforms they won: the National Labor Relations Act, which established union rights; the Social Security Act, which created the eponymous program as well as family assistance and unemployment insurance; the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the 40-hour workweek and the minimum wage and banned child labor; and, indirectly, legislation touching on housing and urban development, veterans' policy, and more.29 A telling example of Stoller's oversight in this regard comes in his narrative of the Southern crusade of small businesses and farmers against the predations of the A...arket chain. While relating this story, Stoller mentions as an aside that the giant chain struck an alliance with the American Federation of Labor and various progressive consumer and cooperative groups to strengthen its hand against the antitrusters. This anti-anti-monopoly alliance, which wedded the interests of labor to those of a large corporation, represents the spirit and logic of the New Deal at least as well as Patman does. Stoller, however, cannot see it as anything but opportunism. The fact that Patman supported the Taft-Hartley Act, establishing right-to-work laws and hobbling the labor movement, also goes unexplored.30 To be fair, part of the problem here is that the New Deal was itself a fundamentally equivocal and contradictory regime. It attempted to marry market regulation and antitrust with an implicit corporatism. While breaking up and regulating some markets, liberal policy-makers continued to pursue high-level social bargains among capital, labor, and consumers, explicitly until 1935 and tacitly and indirectly for decades thereafter. Stoller hyperbolically draws parallels between the former efforts\u2014those that accepted or even encouraged corporatist social compromises\u2014with fascism and then proceeds to ignore them as a key component of Democratic rule from the New Deal to the Great Society. But his elision of the centrality of labor-management conflict and compromise also leads him to elevate antitrust from a component of liberal policy to a synonym for democracy and freedom.31 Goliath finds a key case study, for example, in the way the federal government set up competitors to Alcoa's aluminum monopoly in the 1940s. This move, meant to keep the supply of aluminum flowing for the war machine, is presented as substantiation of Stoller's reimagined version of World WarII as a global struggle between monopoly and free competition. (One wonders where the Soviet Union is in this account.) But as historian Jonathan Bean observes, two-thirds of major war production contracts went to the largest 100 corporations, and two-thirds of research and development money went to 68 firms. Small manufacturers shrank dramatically over the war years in terms of relative employment while large ones grew. After the war, when it came time to reconvert the $17billion of publicly owned defense industries to privatized civilian production, two-thirds of their economic value went to 87firms. Bean writes, 'The federal government sold all of its synthetic rubber facilities to the Big Four rubber companies and allowed U.S. Steel to purchase 71 percent of all the publicly built steel plants.' The steel monopoly, as we already noted, became a key mechanism in the balance between capital and labor struck by New Deal liberals, allowing for wage increases for the organized workers who formed the base of the Democratic Party. Yet you simply will not encounter in Goliath the overwhelming counterevidence that suggests the New Deal was marked by such social democratic features balanced on oligopolistic markets.32 All of this is to not discount the fact that the New Deal experimented in antitrust efforts more actively than what came before it or after it, but it did so while helping to bolster a monopolistic and quasi-corporatist economic system. The New Deal and its heirs, in other words, rested on multiple pillars. White Southern Democrats wanted cheap manufactured goods, competitive markets, and decentralized power that protected their racial order in the South; the multiethnic, multiracial, and working-class coalition of Northern Democrats wanted high wages and stable employment in industry. The tension between these two, structural as well as ideological in nature, eventually consumed the party in the 1970s in the economic chaos called 'stagflation.'33 For someone making a political argument by way of history, Stoller can view monopoly quite ahistorically. For many, monopoly is a more or less inevitable result of capitalist development. Marxists have argued that market consolidation is a mechanism by which capitalism has managed its periodic crises. By 'socializing' production, or summoning together the once dispersed productive powers of society into a collective force, monopoly at once advanced capitalism's development and produced a kind of socialism in embryo trapped by its private ownership structure. For capitalists, this was true too. J.P. Morgan saw the rise of monopoly as an irresistible element of capitalism. Breaking up the trusts was as impossible, he said, as unscrambling an omelet. As a historical phenomenon\u2014that is, developing over time in relation to particular contexts of events\u2014monopoly has qualities that make it difficult to reverse. On this view, anti-monopoly is useful only within a larger account of the development and trajectory of capitalism itself, of which monopoly is just a symptom.34 But for Stoller, monopoly is something that exists mostly outside time and the particularities of political economy. The essence of monopolization can be found in both medieval feudalism and 20th-century fascism. China, too, Stoller tells us, is just one giant monopoly. The phenomenon has no distinct cause other than the greed of the powerful and the power of the greedy; it is merely the name for what happens when greed and power meet. It has, in this sense, no history that can be related except through the machinations of individuals, nefarious or heroic.35 Operating with an anti-monopoly analysis but not a historical one, Stoller as a result constantly gets things only half right. 'What of the party of the people, the Democrats?' he asks as he moves into the 1980s and '90s. 'Throughout American history, the triumph of plutocrats in a decade provoked a backlash, and the opposing party would win a series of elections and reorient political economy. But the Chicago School has dismantled this fail-safe.' Stoller is of course correct that the Democrats failed utterly to channel the miseries of neoliberalism into a political challenge and instead have served as handmaidens to worsening inequality. But the idea that this collaboration is due to the influence of the Chicago School in particular\u2014as opposed to much larger structural forces that have prevailed around the world\u2014is not an analysis; it's a conspiracy theory. It also excludes almost all of the important reasons Democrats turned rightward and implies no theory of what might be done to counteract this. No vision of politics follows from the insight that elites sometimes scheme and accrue influence. This becomes a genuinely political idea only when it can be used to develop a specific vision of conflicting interests, friends who might be organized and enemies who must be divided and overcome. 'They're for the powerful, we're for the people' is something Al Gore said in his acceptance speech for the Democrats' 2000 presidential nomination; one hopes for something a bit more precise in a 600-page book.36 The ahistorical and thus apolitical quality of Stoller's book becomes even more apparent when he attempts to generalize the perfectly sound idea of breaking up some monopolies into a transcendent principle of democratic life: that the basis for all forms of freedom\u2014social, economic, political\u2014lies in open access to commerce. 'Each of us,' he rhapsodizes in his conclusion, 'is a worker, a businessperson, a consumer, and a citizen.' I am not a businessperson, and I suspect this may be true for many of my readers too. As far as I can tell, even Stoller is not a businessperson. Many in this country are, of course, also not citizens, as we are grimly reminded every day. Even in the working class, millions are not workers in the strictest sense. Many students, incarcerated people, disabled people, retirees, and the unemployed do not perform wage work.37 Yet Stoller's eye can track only the disposal of property, and in it he finds liberty itself. Capital encounters merely other capital, big or small. The vast majority of us who lack property that we can live off and thus must sell our labor power to survive are visible, in this analysis, only if we're conceived of as tiny capitalists. Stoller's history, as a result, is blind to the structural coercion of workers that brings them into their encounter with capital and gives capitalism its fundamental character. For those of us who cannot live off our property, the economy is not where we become free through trade; it is where we become unfree through work or the lack of it. Property is a relationship, not an object. The liberty it grants some is always domination for others. The Jeffersonian smallholder class, for example, was built on the backs (or the land) of women, children, slaves, low-wage and migrant workers, and indigenous people. A focus solely on market relations loses sight of this political and economic domination.38 Stoller's framework also causes him to present anti-monopoly as a principle transcending differences between the right and the left\u2014an approach that gives space to a nationalist vision of the people as an integral whole and who are beset by insidious outsiders. On the hunt for anti-monopolists of all shapes and sizes, he finds an ally in Senator Josh Hawley, a 'national conservative' who delivered a thinly veiled anti-Semitic speech about the 'cosmopolitan' attack on America's 'common culture,' because of Hawley's criticism of Big Tech. (It seems likely that Stoller is naive here rather than cynical, but it can be only one of the two.) In the same vein, he has become an advocate of confrontation with China, writing in Foreign Policy, 'The era of strong private corporate power is over. Public power is being reasserted over U.S. corporations. The only question is whether the public power that assumes control of Western corporations, and thus Western society, is American or Chinese.'39 One need not applaud the regime in Beijing to dread where this goes. And Stoller also regularly bemoans the effects of monopoly on America's weapons-making capacity and recently criticized tech workers for protesting their employers' work with the Pentagon. 'Warfare tech and AI isn't necessarily about killing,' he explained on Twitter, 'and weakening the military institutions isn't the right way to change *war policy.*'40 Throughout the book, Stoller distinguishes his anti-monopoly politics from the socialist and social democratic traditions of the left. Since he sees the tradition stretching from Jefferson to Patman as the core of democratic politics in America, anything that falls outside the spectrum between Hamilton and Jefferson is invisible, an illegitimate infiltrator, or an especially curious specimen of Hamiltonism or Jeffersonism. If you follow his commentary, you'll know, for example, that he's convinced that W.E.B. Du Bois's classic Black Reconstruction\u2014a book that speaks approvingly of Reconstruction as a 'dictatorship of the proletariat'\u2014is merely an entry in the Jeffersonian tradition, contrary to Du Bois's Marxist intentions. This reading rests precisely on a misunderstanding of the desire of freed slaves to own land as an impulse toward small business rather than the wish to be free of the supervisor's lash.41 It is clear from the outset of Goliath that Stoller very evidently wishes for a more just and equal world, and many of his solutions\u2014breaking up and regulating the big banks and tech companies, for example\u2014would be far preferable to the status quo. But he does not explain any of the reasons an anti-monopoly politics might win or achieve any staying power. If all of American history is defined by the struggle between the great heroes of anti-monopoly democracy and the avarice of Mellonism, then why would powerful and greedy men not machinate once more against antitrust laws? Why wouldn't disdainful intellectuals conspire against the people's cause yet again? If the prevalence of monopoly, as Stoller insists, bears no relation to the larger social and economic environment and is purely a voluntary choice, then there's no reason to believe that anti-monopoly can produce a stable resolution to the problem of corporate power. From where might antitrust politics draw social and political power with a mass base of farmers, craftsmen, and small businessmen long gone? What might bind the people as a whole together to confront their overlords? By way of employment in some cases, low prices or convenience in others, the monopolies that he detests have sunk their roots into large sections of society. Come after Amazon, and you come after its tens of millions of users too.42 The socialism that Stoller dismisses emerged precisely in answer to these problems. It contends that capitalism gives rise\u2014not once but repeatedly\u2014to a potentially coherent and antagonistic social force capable of collective action. This is the working class. Because capitalism produces a larger population over time that cannot survive from its own property and therefore joins many of these people at sites of collective labor, it makes it possible for them to organize and then to exercise leverage and political leadership over other sectors of society. (This is the reason that the most exciting intellectual work in antitrust is being done by scholars who work on market power specifically in employment, such as Sanjukta Paul, Suresh Naidu, and Marshall Steinbaum.) One may criticize the socialist's faith in the working class as politically naive or empirically inaccurate. But in any case, socialism (and beneath it Marxism as well) contains a theory of politics\u2014a definite account of friends and enemies and why each is what it is\u2014whereas Stoller's populism does not. This is why socialists have proved to be so much less prone to deviations into jingoism and conspiracy theory than their populist peers.43 One might also add that socialism and anti-monopoly are not necessarily opposed; In recent history, as well in the New Deal era, the two have blended in a combined opposition to the current economic and political order. For both sides, this blending together has been both opportunistic and fruitful. The presence in the presidential race of candidates who approximately represent each ideology illustrates the dynamic of this marriage of convenience. The socialist who speaks of class war allows the anti-monopolist to leverage her plans for fixing it into popularity; in turn, the plan maker must mimic the socialist's positions in order for her gambit to succeed, thus validating his ideas. Each gets to obfuscate usefully through the presence of the other and because they share enemies: Wall Street and its political representatives.44 But Stoller's book also demonstrates some of the underlying differences. Anti-monopolists oppose the economic elite but not the social system that gave rise to it. Likewise, between socialism and anti-monopoly lies a vast difference in analysis about the nature of the state and, indeed, power itself. For the anti-monopolist, the state is a shield for the people against their plutocratic enemies; power inheres in the state, and it is only a question of whether the people capture it through elections. The anti-monopolist agenda is therefore to put the good expert into office, where she may wield the regulatory power of the state for the common good. For the socialist, on the other hand, the state is not neutral. Its purpose and nature are to serve the interests of the ruling class. If it can be remade to serve the working class, this project cannot be achieved without enormous social conflict, and this change can come only from below, not just through elections but through sustained attacks on authority at every level: in workplaces, schools, families, neighborhoods, and beyond. Friendly elements within the state may lend important support to such struggles, and this is one of the reasons socialists seek state power. But socialism cannot be achieved solely by means of such power.45 Which of these analyses you believe (and which diagnosis you accept) is, in part, the result of the different historical narratives that we tell. If you think the problem we face is something like 'crony capitalism' or 'money in politics,' then there is one weird trick that will fix it: reining in the too-powerful corporations\u2014often by using laws already on the books\u2014in order to get back to the people's business. This program, often presented as structural change, nonetheless represents an explicitly superficial approach: the idea that our economy has acquired a predatory, parasitic stratum at its top that needs to be stripped off, allowing the underlying system to work as intended. Explicitly or not, it's the promise of a return to a lost utopia of markets, a society without fundamental antagonisms. If, on the other hand, you think our problems are deeper, woven more fundamentally into the structure of how we live together\u2014which things and people we value and which we discard, who must wear the saddle and who gets to ride\u2014then there's no going back. If the problem lies with capitalism as a system and not specific malicious capitalists, then we've got to embark on an adventure of a different kind, one that leads us not back to the comforts of midcentury America but somewhere wild and new. Goliath will not help us find the way.46 [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy\">http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TNTN103220157961315350625876100211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTN-5135</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1K-XDM1-JCMN-Y1VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7588\"/><timeReceived>1:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Nation Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001YF9</classCode><className>UNITED STATES STEEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541922 COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541430 GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

(Bettmann via Getty Images) My father always told me that all businessmen were sons of bitches,#8217; John F. Kennedy once griped, #8216;but I never believed it until now!#8217; The young president recalled this pearl of wisdom in 1962, when the industrial giant US Steel announced its plans to raise prices, despite months of campaigning by the White House against such an increase. Steel was central to the US economy: The new highway system, the vast war machine, the automobiles and the oil pipelines that fed them were all made from it. </p><p>If steel prices went up, all prices went up, threatening an inflationary spiral. Both Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower had sought to avert this, and Kennedy was no different, making a public show of leaning on US Steel to keep its prices down. But the steel industry was determined to get its way. Under pressure from organized workers demanding higher wages, it felt that it had very little choice.1 Ad Policy[1] Books in Review  The 1960s are often remembered as the last decade of the golden age of egalitarian, high-growth capitalism. The New Deal reforms of the 1930s had something to do with this postwar boom, but so did the corporate structure and market position of the giant, vertically integrated industrial corporations like US Steel. In response to organized labor's challenge, they were able to provide one of the great downward redistributions of income in the history of modern capitalism. These companies could afford to do so, in part, because they enjoyed limited competition in their coordinated, oligopolistic markets. The US government had dismantled the formal price-control system under pressure from manufacturers in 1946, and so it relied to a large degree on informal mechanisms (so-called jawboning) to hold down prices, often by inserting itself into collective bargaining processes in consolidated markets like steel and autos. Major American steel firms, for example, bargained jointly with the United Steelworkers of America\u2014an affair of such economic significance that it spilled out of the private sector and repeatedly became a public matter. Contract after contract would wind up being settled in the White House. Whoever was president found that he could not afford the havoc of a protracted nationwide steel shutdown and so felt enormous pressure to deliver a victory to the steelworkers' union. But the White House also could not tolerate increases in the price of steel, which were the employers' device to pay for a union victory. So a tripartite bargain was struck whose purpose (for the government) was to restrain wage and price growth enough to limit inflation, but not so much as to leave workers dissatisfied.2 When business, labor, and government come together to determine how much goods would cost and workers would be paid, the result can hardly be described as a market process. The postwar years of the 1950s and '60s were the age of #8216;monopoly capitalism,#8217; as the Marxists then called it, or, less polemically, an era of #8216;administered prices.#8217; The cartelization of American industry had its negative effects, including the technological stagnation of US manufacturing and the irresistible rise of inflation, culminating in the chaotic 1970s. But in any case, it served many American workers well and, at least for a time, helped produce a more egalitarian country. But when it finally came crashing down, it took working-class incomes with it\u2014a disaster from which we have yet to recover.3 In recent years, however, a different account of the origin and nature of economic inequality has become popular in some quarters. Dubbed the new antitrust or new Brandeisianism (after Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who laid the intellectual foundation for vigorous market reform), this approach offers a distinctive, simple, and insistent diagnosis of economic polarization. Rather than emphasize the punitive turn of social welfare programs, the loss of union density, and the underlying structural pressures on employers to suppress wages, it instead argues that equality was undermined by the renascence of monopoly power. Monopolies today need not swallow a whole supply chain into a single corporation; instead, they work when a large firm dominates smaller ones, dictating to them without needing to own them. Astride their respective economic sectors, tech companies control our minds, retail giants like Amazon and Walmart enforce terms of production on suppliers and terms of purchase on consumers, and Wall Street firms extract a punishing toll from every movement of money and suck value from the whole economy. Together, they are eroding the integrity of our political and economic systems.4 In his new book, Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, Matt Stoller, one of the most irrepressible members of this new generation of Brandeisians, elevates this argument to something like a theory of history. For Stoller, all of American history\u2014and much of world history\u2014has been defined by a struggle between monopoly and democracy. Where property is concentrated, its owners warp the public institutions that exist around them, allowing them to concentrate property still more. At the extreme ends of this quantitative process, the monopolist captures the state itself, with sovereignty a mere trapping of consolidated market power in the hands of a feudal lord or fascist dictator.5 Over the history of the United States, Stoller finds the greatest nemesis of such authoritarian pretensions in America's anti-monopoly tradition. For him, anti-monopoly is fundamental to the fabric of American democracy. It began with the American Revolution (which he describes as a revolt against the monopoly privileges of British merchants), gained a mass following with Jefferson, became radicalized with the Populists in the late 19th century, tasted power with the Progressives, and culminated in the New Deal and the mid-20th-century US economy. Minimizing the centrality of corporatist coordination to that era, Stoller insists that the New Deal was fundamentally an antitrust program. Its vigorous regulators broke the power that the robber barons accumulated in the 19th century and drove the moneychangers from the temple of democracy, thereby ushering in a golden age of competition and freedom\u2014until this agenda was undermined by scurrilous and arrogant schemers in both parties, who opened the way for a massive reassertion of corporate power beginning in the 1970s.6 What's so telling about this narrative is not only the fact that the golden age of competition that Stoller wishes to restore is the very same period in which great, vertically integrated oligopolies ruled the economy in coordination with one another, labor unions, and the state; it is also that his expansive view of economic power still can't find a place for class conflict\u2014which, although invisible to Stoller, was often the engine of downward redistribution in the midcentury boom. Because he does not grasp how the fundamental antagonism between labor and capital underlies other forms of economic rivalry, Stoller misunderstands the nature of the New Deal and the legacy it leaves us. As a result, his book offers us a useful guide to some of the ills of concentrated market power today but does not ultimately come to terms with their real origin or present any viable political response.7  Related Article Stoller initially gained some prominence in the early 2000s as a member of the cohort of progressive political bloggers who found their voice in the early years of the Iraq War. Stoller at first supported the war, but he soon became horrified by how the Democratic establishment rolled over for the agenda of George W. Bush's administration, and he and a set of his peers\u2014writers like Matt Yglesias, Ezra Klein, and Markos Moulitsas\u2014helped mobilize support for progressive reforms and the Democrats who championed them.8 Although Stoller continued to see himself as an outsider in the years after Barack Obama's election, he, like the other members of this cohort, joined the intellectual and political ranks of the DC machine and managed to establish their careers before the Great Recession started in 2008. Moulitsas, the founder of the website Daily Kos, became an unofficial Democratic Party operative. Klein and Yglesias emerged as celebrated policy journalists, eventually launching the mammoth operation at Vox. By the end of the decade, Stoller, for his part, was working as an economic policy staffer in Congress. From this perch, he watched with dismay as the Obama White House did little to break from the prevailing economic consensus. With Clinton administration veterans Larry Summers, Rahm Emanuel, and Timothy Geithner back in power, Obama and his team of economic advisers sided with the lords of finance, directing unimaginable streams of money to shore up Wall Street while letting millions of Americans lose their homes to foreclosure.9 This marked a second phase in Stoller's politicization. #8216;It seemed clear to many of us during the bailouts,#8217; he notes in Goliath, #8216;that the public would turn vehemently against the political establishment for taking their property, their stake in America, and so it has.#8217; Stoller left Capitol Hill and fell into the orbit of the anti-monopoly thinkers and activists affiliated with the New America Foundation, particularly journalist Barry Lynn, whose 2009 book Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction argued that hidden monopolies have insinuated themselves throughout our economy. For Stoller and this emerging anti-monopoly clique, the betrayal that took place after 2008 had a much longer history. In the 1970s, an affluent faction of Democrats helped kill the party's #8216;populist soul.#8217;10 Stoller began to formulate this thesis in historical terms in a widely shared essay that appeared in The Atlantic shortly before Trump won the 2016 election. Historians like Judith Stein and Lily Geismer told versions of this story before, arguing that in the 1970s middle-class professionals wrested control of the Democratic Party away from its blue-collar social base and unleashed a set of market-centric reforms and deregulatory schemes. But Stoller offers a somewhat different analysis: The transformation that these middle-class professionals helped to enact tilted the balance of class power, in his view, because it allowed the advance of market concentration. And he tells this story primarily through the perspective of Wright Patman, a Democratic congressman from rural East Texas, a #8216;proud Hillbilly#8217; and dogged foe of market consolidation and financial power. As Stoller announces early in Goliath, he sees this history #8216;through [Patman's] eyes.#8217; In his telling, Democrats lost their way when the yuppie progressives often called the #8216;Watergate Babies#8217; swept into power in 1974 and ousted Patman from his Banking Committee chairmanship, with grave consequences. #8216;The destruction of the anti-monopoly and anti-bank tradition in the Democratic Party,#8217; Stoller writes, #8216;has also cleared the way for the greatest concentration of economic power in a century.#8217;11 In Goliath, he retells the story of Patman and the fall of the New Deal Democratic Party. But Stoller also aspires to something far grander. He insists that almost all of American history can be understood in terms of the struggle between the forces of monopoly on the one hand and democracy on the other, beginning with the feud between the aristocratic Alexander Hamilton and the democratic Thomas Jefferson and extending into the 20th century, with the rise of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, tribunes of the people in the age of mass democracy. (Glossed over or ignored outright here are the central roles in the Jeffersonian popular tradition of gnocidaire Andrew Jackson and of pro-slavery politics.) It is, in fact, with Wilson that Goliath opens in earnest, with his campaign for the presidency in 1912, when he faced off against Theodore Roosevelt (as well as William Howard Taft and Eugene Debs) over the question of what was to be done about the accumulation of economic power in the hands of the few. Railroad and coal barons mutilated their workers in spectacular workplace horrors, while bankers lorded it over society like European aristocrats. #8216;We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!#8217; Roosevelt declared, and for him, this battle required introducing a corporatist system that regulated but did not break up the new industrial giants. For Wilson, who embraced the ideas of Brandeis, it meant splitting them up\u2014what he called a #8216;New Freedom.#8217;12 In Stoller's rendering of this story, Wilson attempted to launch something like a New Deal and might have pulled it off if World War I hadn't gotten in the way. But America's entrance into the war in 1917 and the economic chaos and reactionary politics that it unleashed allowed the reassertion of power by the forces of monopoly. #8216;Wilson, so energetic at the beginning of his term,#8217; Stoller writes, #8216;could do nothing by the end of his tenure except lie in bed as his administration jailed thousands of innocents, and as the plutocrats swiftly subverted the new order he had imposed just a few years earlier.#8217; Apparently, the Wilson administration's reform agenda rested on the vision and energy of but a single figure, and his physical decline brought the New Freedom down with it. The egalitarian ambitions of Wilson and the anti-monopoly tradition would have to be put on hold as Andrew Mellon, the last of the great robber barons, rose to power and, as secretary of the treasury, unleashed the oligarchic forces of the 1920s. Wealth accumulated at the top, while the common people suffered\u2014a regime Stoller calls #8216;Mellonism.#8217;13  With the Depression, agency in the narrative shifts again, from Mellon and his accomplices to a new generation of anti-monopolists, including many in Franklin Roosevelt's brain trust and, of course, Wright Patman, Stoller's East Texas hero. Patman arrived in Washington in 1929, the year of the crash, and almost immediately set about bird-dogging Mellon. Patman supported the marchers of the Bonus Army, advocated cheap credit for farmers, and wrote with Arkansas Senator Joe Robinson a landmark anti-monopoly bill in 1936 that barred predatory pricing in retail.14  Related Article A beneficiary of the South's racist one-party system, Patman may have been a champion of economic competition, but he also spent decades in power without much political competition, accruing seniority and rising to the chairmanship of the Banking Committee. (This was the reason he drew the ire of the Watergate Babies in 1975; they wanted to eject the Southerners from their powerful sinecures.) Stoller unconvincingly suggests his great man was only as racist as he was obliged to be politically and was appreciated by his black constituents, even if Patman was, after all, one of only five Texas Democrats in the House to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto denouncing the Brown v. Board of Education decision. (Seventeen refused.)15 One wishes Stoller had paused to contemplate why anti-monopoly tended to find its most vigorous advocates in white Southerners like Wilson, Robinson, and Patman. He suggests this is merely a coincidence and that there existed no historical relationship between white supremacy and pro-competitive politics. In part, this is because Stoller really is interested only in telling us how the relentlessly populist Patman's advocacy helped shape the New Deal. #8216;Patman brought forward what the farmers of the 1890s demanded of their society, a democracy with an egalitarian system of free enterprise, where small business had the same shot as Andrew Mellon to compete. He stood up to Mellon. He stood for the plain people, and the veterans. And in doing so, he destroyed the legitimacy of the plutocrats that dominated America.#8217; Summarizing the emerging egalitarian era, Stoller observes, #8216;Finally, after the second great war of the century, democracy had taken hold in the commercial sphere.#8217;16 If this doesn't match your idea of the origins of the New Deal era, you're not alone. Wishing anti-monopoly to be a politics for all times and places, Stoller cannot allow it any historical specificity. He does not satisfactorily wrestle with the fact that Patman and his antitrust attorney allies formed only one part of the New Deal coalition. Anti-monopoly was a part of a much larger political spectrum, which also included corporatism of just the kind Stoller abhors. Distinguishing among these elements is possible, and one can argue that one is preferable to the other. But doing so would also require acknowledging the existence and logic of another dimension of the New Deal beyond antitrust and corporatism\u2014and that would mean considering labor and class.17 In Goliath's second half, Stoller gives us his story of how the New Deal's anti-monopoly democracy was unmade. Some of the beats are familiar: His narrative dwells on the rise of the Chicago School of economics\u2014what Stoller calls #8216;the new Mellonism#8217;\u2014where American antitrust law was reinvented by characters like law professor Aaron Director, economist George Stigler, and jurist Robert Bork. The result was the law and economics movement, which played an enormous role in changing doctrine in general and elevating the significance of consumer welfare in particular. These thinkers constructed a consumer welfare standard for antitrust cases that didn't necessarily focus on big or small but rather cheap and thus became the cover under which market power reasserted itself. (Whatever else Amazon is, it is cheap and convenient for the consumer.)18 But the Chicago School neoliberals and the politicians and judges they influenced were given valuable cover, Stoller argues, by intellectuals on the left, who saw in large-scale economic concentration the basis of a social order beyond capitalism\u2014and saw in populism only backward-looking reaction. Stoller reserves pages of bizarre vitriol here for sociologist C. Wright Mills, historian Richard Hofstadter, and economist John Kenneth Galbraith, whom he blames for eroding the ideological basis of antitrust in the postwar years. #8216;Hofstadter and Galbraith together,#8217; he tells us in a puzzling passage, #8216;created a new language and new frame of analysis designed to eliminate the antimonopoly tradition in American politics. A new villain, the grubby racist small businessman, had replaced the money trust.#8217; As Stoller concludes later on, #8216;#8216;Beautiful smugness' is how John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter persuaded a generation to give up their liberties.#8217; Even if Stoller's readings of these thinkers represented them accurately, this would seem an awfully large role to assign to a sociologist, a historian, and an economist\u2014even unusually prominent ones.19 While neoliberalism germinated in Chicago and smug intellectuals fulminated in New York, finance regrouped. #8216;Set free from their wartime constraints, and then from the constraints imposed by White House control over the Fed, bankers tried to seize more power,#8217; Stoller writes, and financiers like Citibank chief Walter Wriston and conglomerate mogul Saul Steinberg invented financial tools to manipulate the market\u2014including the certificate of deposit, a bondlike instrument that allowed Citibank to evade regulations meant to limit bank size. When Patman came after these bankers, his success was mixed; they had learned from the experience of the 1930s. Stoller writes:20  Wriston didn't appear as a robber baron, but a cosmopolitan executive who believed in racial tolerance, liked rock #8216;n' roll, and wanted to be a responsible business leader in a technologically advanced society. Citibank, as he told governors and local politicians, didn't pollute, and it went without mention that the bank didn't send soldiers to Vietnam.21 Perceiving an intersection between a fashionable cultural progressivism born out of the 1960s and a renascent economic oligarchy, Stoller continues, affluent, snobby liberals teamed up with bankers against the American people. By the early 1970s, everyone from Ralph Nader and the Watergate Babies to enlightened bankers and Chicago School economists were working together to bring the curtain down on economic democracy. With Patman ousted in 1975, Jimmy Carter deregulating key markets shortly thereafter, and Democrats taking up the Chicago School's ideas, corporate power took off. Unshackled from regulatory constraints, big-box retail spread across small-town America, while banks and more exotic financial firms began to reassert themselves, growing in size and power. From there, Stoller offers us a straight line to the election of Trump, who fed on the democratic decay that set in once the regulatory state had been dismantled. As Stoller puts it in his Atlantic essay, #8216;The story of Patman's ousting is part of the larger story of how the Democratic Party helped to create today's shockingly disillusioned and sullen public, a large chunk of whom is now marching for Donald Trump.#8217;22 In this respect, Goliath is an ambitious and risky undertaking that proffers a century-long narrative encompassing virtually every aspect of American political and economic life. But Stoller tends to tell his story from the perspective of individual politicians, intellectuals, and millionaires\u2014Patman, Wilson, Brandeis, Mellon, and the like. Structural forces recede, personalities grow in importance, and it becomes difficult to tell why anything is happening.23 For this reason, great changes that Stoller would like to trace tend to go unexplained except in terms of the greed and corruption, or farsightedness and altruism, of particular individuals. Wilson's Federal Reserve, for example, was a good idea\u2014#8216;designed to move power over the economy from Wall Street to the people#8217;\u2014until it fell into the hands of #8216;shortsighted private bankers who could not or would not stop speculative bubbles.#8217; (Why? How?) The defeat of Wilson's ostensibly benevolent peace plan is also attributed to the machinations of robber barons. #8216;[Henry Clay] Frick and Mellon believed that America should use its power solely to enhance American financial interests, not to engage in some scheme for world peace. The two men saw opposition to the [Treaty of Versailles] as a way to discredit the Democrats and drive them from power.#8217; Mellon then became the most powerful man in the country\u2014#8216;King Andrew#8217;\u2014setting the stage in turn for the stock market crash of 1929. Everything in this narrative is about market power, and market power is about greed and opportunity.24 Yet when one attempts to peer beneath this layer of individual action, avaricious or heroic, Stoller's narrative begins to unravel. In order to conjure up a united front of the common people against corporate power, he repeatedly collapses the distinction between the problem of monopoly and the problem of class. Again and again, he cites capital's offenses against labor as evidence of the need for anti-monopoly measures, writing phrases like #8216;small businessman and blue-collar worker#8217; as if the reader will not notice he has named two separate things.25 Stoller isn't wrong in asserting that there were many working-class people invested in breaking the power of the robber barons, but anti-monopoly as it emerged as a mass movement in the late 19thcentury was only one component of what was often called #8216;the social question,#8217; or if you were less inclined to euphemism, #8216;the labor question.#8217; To be sure, agrarian rebels demanded the death of the money power, while huge strike waves shook the country in 1877 and again in 1886, developing into general strikes in multiple cities. The United States saw repeated instances of workers shutting down large sections of the nation's rail network in wild, out-of-control confrontations. Gun battles between unions and company thugs became more and more common, as in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892 and Cripple Creek, Colorado, in 1894. But at issue in these labor conflicts was not just the cartelization of the economy but the whole system of relationships that made up America's social order, in particular the #8216;wages system#8217;\u2014that is, capitalist labor markets\u2014and its bouts of wage cuts and unemployment. When workers in these struggles denounced monopolies, they often did so because they viewed concentrated capital as part of a deeper problem: capitalism itself. They struck because industrial wage labor was a new form of domination, and they wished to diminish and eventually end it.26 For Stoller, however, inequality and the class tensions it unleashed are made not inside the process of production but in the #8216;commercial sphere.#8217; Industry and commerce, however, are obviously not the same thing, and this conflation leads him to serious conceptual problems. The political issues that arise from production occur between labor and capital\u2014over wages, hours, safety, unionization, workers' control, and so on\u2014and are quite distinct from conflicts over market power, which occur between capital and capital and, as the legal scholar Lina Khan put it, concern #8216;product quality, variety and innovation#8217; as well as prices. The two are related to each other, as when labor markets take on monopsonistic characteristics, but they remain distinct. Yet wherever he looks, Stoller sees the two spheres as one and accordingly vexed by the same question: what to do about the robber barons\u2014which is to say, the issue of concentration at the top. Social inequality, the relationship between the classes, and the maldistribution of economic and political power are all collapsed into a question of the bigness and badness of the biggest, baddest members of the elite.27 He is also correct in asserting that anti-monopoly sentiment has enjoyed a large social base in American history, but it was not among #8216;the people#8217; in general and certainly not the working class in particular. Rather, it was a politics that arose among several distinct social and economic groups as they came under increasing economic pressure around the turn of the 20th century and settled on trust-busting as the instrument of their relief. They were not all of one kind. There were farmers and craftsmen, shopkeepers and small businessmen, spread out across small towns and the countryside. These groups linked up with Progressive lawyers and professionals in the first third of the 20th century\u2014especially those influenced by Brandeis\u2014who believed that market regulation could limit the power of corporations in order to produce a stable, harmonious social order.28  Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/</url> Yet since Stoller takes as a given that anti-monopoly populists speak on behalf of the people as an organic whole, he presents Patman and the antitrust activists in the New Deal as the entirety of that project's egalitarian thrust. Invisible in his account is the Northern social democratic politics of millions of working-class Americans that\u2014I think I'm on safe ground here\u2014was also quite influential in shaping that era's policies. Whether or not you rate antitrust as important, it still beggars belief to see it as a more significant force in the remaking of American society in the 1930s than the insurgency of millions of industrial workers and the wave of reforms they won: the National Labor Relations Act, which established union rights; the Social Security Act, which created the eponymous program as well as family assistance and unemployment insurance; the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the 40-hour workweek and the minimum wage and banned child labor; and, indirectly, legislation touching on housing and urban development, veterans' policy, and more.29 A telling example of Stoller's oversight in this regard comes in his narrative of the Southern crusade of small businesses and farmers against the predations of the A&amp;P market chain. While relating this story, Stoller mentions as an aside that the giant chain struck an alliance with the American Federation of Labor and various progressive consumer and cooperative groups to strengthen its hand against the antitrusters. This anti-anti-monopoly alliance, which wedded the interests of labor to those of a large corporation, represents the spirit and logic of the New Deal at least as well as Patman does. Stoller, however, cannot see it as anything but opportunism. The fact that Patman supported the Taft-Hartley Act, establishing right-to-work laws and hobbling the labor movement, also goes unexplored.30 To be fair, part of the problem here is that the New Deal was itself a fundamentally equivocal and contradictory regime. It attempted to marry market regulation and antitrust with an implicit corporatism. While breaking up and regulating some markets, liberal policy-makers continued to pursue high-level social bargains among capital, labor, and consumers, explicitly until 1935 and tacitly and indirectly for decades thereafter. Stoller hyperbolically draws parallels between the former efforts\u2014those that accepted or even encouraged corporatist social compromises\u2014with fascism and then proceeds to ignore them as a key component of Democratic rule from the New Deal to the Great Society. But his elision of the centrality of labor-management conflict and compromise also leads him to elevate antitrust from a component of liberal policy to a synonym for democracy and freedom.31 Goliath finds a key case study, for example, in the way the federal government set up competitors to Alcoa's aluminum monopoly in the 1940s. This move, meant to keep the supply of aluminum flowing for the war machine, is presented as substantiation of Stoller's reimagined version of World WarII as a global struggle between monopoly and free competition. (One wonders where the Soviet Union is in this account.) But as historian Jonathan Bean observes, two-thirds of major war production contracts went to the largest 100 corporations, and two-thirds of research and development money went to 68 firms. Small manufacturers shrank dramatically over the war years in terms of relative employment while large ones grew. After the war, when it came time to reconvert the $17billion of publicly owned defense industries to privatized civilian production, two-thirds of their economic value went to 87firms. Bean writes, #8216;The federal government sold all of its synthetic rubber facilities to the Big Four rubber companies and allowed U.S. Steel to purchase 71 percent of all the publicly built steel plants.#8217; The steel monopoly, as we already noted, became a key mechanism in the balance between capital and labor struck by New Deal liberals, allowing for wage increases for the organized workers who formed the base of the Democratic Party. Yet you simply will not encounter in Goliath the overwhelming counterevidence that suggests the New Deal was marked by such social democratic features balanced on oligopolistic markets.32 All of this is to not discount the fact that the New Deal experimented in antitrust efforts more actively than what came before it or after it, but it did so while helping to bolster a monopolistic and quasi-corporatist economic system. The New Deal and its heirs, in other words, rested on multiple pillars. White Southern Democrats wanted cheap manufactured goods, competitive markets, and decentralized power that protected their racial order in the South; the multiethnic, multiracial, and working-class coalition of Northern Democrats wanted high wages and stable employment in industry. The tension between these two, structural as well as ideological in nature, eventually consumed the party in the 1970s in the economic chaos called #8216;stagflation.#8217;33 For someone making a political argument by way of history, Stoller can view monopoly quite ahistorically. For many, monopoly is a more or less inevitable result of capitalist development. Marxists have argued that market consolidation is a mechanism by which capitalism has managed its periodic crises. By #8216;socializing#8217; production, or summoning together the once dispersed productive powers of society into a collective force, monopoly at once advanced capitalism's development and produced a kind of socialism in embryo trapped by its private ownership structure. For capitalists, this was true too. J.P. Morgan saw the rise of monopoly as an irresistible element of capitalism. Breaking up the trusts was as impossible, he said, as unscrambling an omelet. As a historical phenomenon\u2014that is, developing over time in relation to particular contexts of events\u2014monopoly has qualities that make it difficult to reverse. On this view, anti-monopoly is useful only within a larger account of the development and trajectory of capitalism itself, of which monopoly is just a symptom.34 But for Stoller, monopoly is something that exists mostly outside time and the particularities of political economy. The essence of monopolization can be found in both medieval feudalism and 20th-century fascism. China, too, Stoller tells us, is just one giant monopoly. The phenomenon has no distinct cause other than the greed of the powerful and the power of the greedy; it is merely the name for what happens when greed and power meet. It has, in this sense, no history that can be related except through the machinations of individuals, nefarious or heroic.35 Operating with an anti-monopoly analysis but not a historical one, Stoller as a result constantly gets things only half right. #8216;What of the party of the people, the Democrats?#8217; he asks as he moves into the 1980s and '90s. #8216;Throughout American history, the triumph of plutocrats in a decade provoked a backlash, and the opposing party would win a series of elections and reorient political economy. But the Chicago School has dismantled this fail-safe.#8217; Stoller is of course correct that the Democrats failed utterly to channel the miseries of neoliberalism into a political challenge and instead have served as handmaidens to worsening inequality. But the idea that this collaboration is due to the influence of the Chicago School in particular\u2014as opposed to much larger structural forces that have prevailed around the world\u2014is not an analysis; it's a conspiracy theory. It also excludes almost all of the important reasons Democrats turned rightward and implies no theory of what might be done to counteract this. No vision of politics follows from the insight that elites sometimes scheme and accrue influence. This becomes a genuinely political idea only when it can be used to develop a specific vision of conflicting interests, friends who might be organized and enemies who must be divided and overcome. #8216;They're for the powerful, we're for the people#8217; is something Al Gore said in his acceptance speech for the Democrats' 2000 presidential nomination; one hopes for something a bit more precise in a 600-page book.36 The ahistorical and thus apolitical quality of Stoller's book becomes even more apparent when he attempts to generalize the perfectly sound idea of breaking up some monopolies into a transcendent principle of democratic life: that the basis for all forms of freedom\u2014social, economic, political\u2014lies in open access to commerce. #8216;Each of us,#8217; he rhapsodizes in his conclusion, #8216;is a worker, a businessperson, a consumer, and a citizen.#8217; I am not a businessperson, and I suspect this may be true for many of my readers too. As far as I can tell, even Stoller is not a businessperson. Many in this country are, of course, also not citizens, as we are grimly reminded every day. Even in the working class, millions are not workers in the strictest sense. Many students, incarcerated people, disabled people, retirees, and the unemployed do not perform wage work.37 Yet Stoller's eye can track only the disposal of property, and in it he finds liberty itself. Capital encounters merely other capital, big or small. The vast majority of us who lack property that we can live off and thus must sell our labor power to survive are visible, in this analysis, only if we're conceived of as tiny capitalists. Stoller's history, as a result, is blind to the structural coercion of workers that brings them into their encounter with capital and gives capitalism its fundamental character. For those of us who cannot live off our property, the economy is not where we become free through trade; it is where we become unfree through work or the lack of it. Property is a relationship, not an object. The liberty it grants some is always domination for others. The Jeffersonian smallholder class, for example, was built on the backs (or the land) of women, children, slaves, low-wage and migrant workers, and indigenous people. A focus solely on market relations loses sight of this political and economic domination.38 Stoller's framework also causes him to present anti-monopoly as a principle transcending differences between the right and the left\u2014an approach that gives space to a nationalist vision of the people as an integral whole and who are beset by insidious outsiders. On the hunt for anti-monopolists of all shapes and sizes, he finds an ally in Senator Josh Hawley, a #8216;national conservative#8217; who delivered a thinly veiled anti-Semitic speech about the #8216;cosmopolitan#8217; attack on America's #8216;common culture,#8217; because of Hawley's criticism of Big Tech. (It seems likely that Stoller is naive here rather than cynical, but it can be only one of the two.) In the same vein, he has become an advocate of confrontation with China, writing in Foreign Policy, #8216;The era of strong private corporate power is over. Public power is being reasserted over U.S. corporations. The only question is whether the public power that assumes control of Western corporations, and thus Western society, is American or Chinese.#8217;39 One need not applaud the regime in Beijing to dread where this goes. And Stoller also regularly bemoans the effects of monopoly on America's weapons-making capacity and recently criticized tech workers for protesting their employers' work with the Pentagon. #8216;Warfare tech and AI isn't necessarily about killing,#8217; he explained on Twitter, #8216;and weakening the military institutions isn't the right way to change *war policy.*#8217;40 Throughout the book, Stoller distinguishes his anti-monopoly politics from the socialist and social democratic traditions of the left. Since he sees the tradition stretching from Jefferson to Patman as the core of democratic politics in America, anything that falls outside the spectrum between Hamilton and Jefferson is invisible, an illegitimate infiltrator, or an especially curious specimen of Hamiltonism or Jeffersonism. If you follow his commentary, you'll know, for example, that he's convinced that W.E.B. Du Bois's classic Black Reconstruction\u2014a book that speaks approvingly of Reconstruction as a #8216;dictatorship of the proletariat#8217;\u2014is merely an entry in the Jeffersonian tradition, contrary to Du Bois's Marxist intentions. This reading rests precisely on a misunderstanding of the desire of freed slaves to own land as an impulse toward small business rather than the wish to be free of the supervisor's lash.41 It is clear from the outset of Goliath that Stoller very evidently wishes for a more just and equal world, and many of his solutions\u2014breaking up and regulating the big banks and tech companies, for example\u2014would be far preferable to the status quo. But he does not explain any of the reasons an anti-monopoly politics might win or achieve any staying power. If all of American history is defined by the struggle between the great heroes of anti-monopoly democracy and the avarice of Mellonism, then why would powerful and greedy men not machinate once more against antitrust laws? Why wouldn't disdainful intellectuals conspire against the people's cause yet again? If the prevalence of monopoly, as Stoller insists, bears no relation to the larger social and economic environment and is purely a voluntary choice, then there's no reason to believe that anti-monopoly can produce a stable resolution to the problem of corporate power. From where might antitrust politics draw social and political power with a mass base of farmers, craftsmen, and small businessmen long gone? What might bind the people as a whole together to confront their overlords? By way of employment in some cases, low prices or convenience in others, the monopolies that he detests have sunk their roots into large sections of society. Come after Amazon, and you come after its tens of millions of users too.42 The socialism that Stoller dismisses emerged precisely in answer to these problems. It contends that capitalism gives rise\u2014not once but repeatedly\u2014to a potentially coherent and antagonistic social force capable of collective action. This is the working class. Because capitalism produces a larger population over time that cannot survive from its own property and therefore joins many of these people at sites of collective labor, it makes it possible for them to organize and then to exercise leverage and political leadership over other sectors of society. (This is the reason that the most exciting intellectual work in antitrust is being done by scholars who work on market power specifically in employment, such as Sanjukta Paul, Suresh Naidu, and Marshall Steinbaum.) One may criticize the socialist's faith in the working class as politically naive or empirically inaccurate. But in any case, socialism (and beneath it Marxism as well) contains a theory of politics\u2014a definite account of friends and enemies and why each is what it is\u2014whereas Stoller's populism does not. This is why socialists have proved to be so much less prone to deviations into jingoism and conspiracy theory than their populist peers.43 One might also add that socialism and anti-monopoly are not necessarily opposed; In recent history, as well in the New Deal era, the two have blended in a combined opposition to the current economic and political order. For both sides, this blending together has been both opportunistic and fruitful. The presence in the presidential race of candidates who approximately represent each ideology illustrates the dynamic of this marriage of convenience. The socialist who speaks of class war allows the anti-monopolist to leverage her plans for fixing it into popularity; in turn, the plan maker must mimic the socialist's positions in order for her gambit to succeed, thus validating his ideas. Each gets to obfuscate usefully through the presence of the other and because they share enemies: Wall Street and its political representatives.44 But Stoller's book also demonstrates some of the underlying differences. Anti-monopolists oppose the economic elite but not the social system that gave rise to it. Likewise, between socialism and anti-monopoly lies a vast difference in analysis about the nature of the state and, indeed, power itself. For the anti-monopolist, the state is a shield for the people against their plutocratic enemies; power inheres in the state, and it is only a question of whether the people capture it through elections. The anti-monopolist agenda is therefore to put the good expert into office, where she may wield the regulatory power of the state for the common good. For the socialist, on the other hand, the state is not neutral. Its purpose and nature are to serve the interests of the ruling class. If it can be remade to serve the working class, this project cannot be achieved without enormous social conflict, and this change can come only from below, not just through elections but through sustained attacks on authority at every level: in workplaces, schools, families, neighborhoods, and beyond. Friendly elements within the state may lend important support to such struggles, and this is one of the reasons socialists seek state power. But socialism cannot be achieved solely by means of such power.45 Which of these analyses you believe (and which diagnosis you accept) is, in part, the result of the different historical narratives that we tell. If you think the problem we face is something like #8216;crony capitalism#8217; or #8216;money in politics,#8217; then there is one weird trick that will fix it: reining in the too-powerful corporations\u2014often by using laws already on the books\u2014in order to get back to the people's business. This program, often presented as structural change, nonetheless represents an explicitly superficial approach: the idea that our economy has acquired a predatory, parasitic stratum at its top that needs to be stripped off, allowing the underlying system to work as intended. Explicitly or not, it's the promise of a return to a lost utopia of markets, a society without fundamental antagonisms. If, on the other hand, you think our problems are deeper, woven more fundamentally into the structure of how we live together\u2014which things and people we value and which we discard, who must wear the saddle and who gets to ride\u2014then there's no going back. If the problem lies with capitalism as a system and not specific malicious capitalists, then we've got to embark on an adventure of a different kind, one that leads us not back to the comforts of midcentury America but somewhere wild and new. Goliath will not help us find the way.46 [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy\">http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TNTN103220157993025558925876100242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTN-5135</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2D-FSP1-JCMN-Y388-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7678\"/><timeReceived>5:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Nation Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001YF9</classCode><className>UNITED STATES STEEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541922 COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541430 GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

Kennedy once griped, \"but I never believed it until now!\" The young president recalled this pearl of wisdom in 1962, when the industrial giant US Steel announced its plans to raise prices, despite months of campaigning by the White House against such an increase. Steel was central to the US economy: The new highway system, the vast war machine, the automobiles and the oil pipelines that fed them were all made from it. If steel prices went up, all prices went up, threatening an inflationary spiral. Both Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower had sought to avert this, and Kennedy was no different, making a public show of leaning on US Steel to keep its prices down. But the steel industry was determined to get its way. Under pressure from organized workers demanding higher wages, it felt that it had very little choice.1</p><p>The 1960s are often remembered as the last decade of the golden age of egalitarian, high-growth capitalism. The New Deal reforms of the 1930s had something to do with this postwar boom, but so did the corporate structure and market position of the giant, vertically integrated industrial corporations like US Steel. In response to organized labor's challenge, they were able to provide one of the great downward redistributions of income in the history of modern capitalism. These companies could afford to do so, in part, because they enjoyed limited competition in their coordinated, oligopolistic markets. The US government had dismantled the formal price-control system under pressure from manufacturers in 1946, and so it relied to a large degree on informal mechanisms (so-called jawboning) to hold down prices, often by inserting itself into collective bargaining processes in consolidated markets like steel and autos. Major American steel firms, for example, bargained jointly with the United Steelworkers of America-an affair of such economic significance that it spilled out of the private sector and repeatedly became a public matter. Contract after contract would wind up being settled in the White House. Whoever was president found that he could not afford the havoc of a protracted nationwide steel shutdown and so felt enormous pressure to deliver a victory to the steelworkers' union. But the White House also could not tolerate increases in the price of steel, which were the employers' device to pay for a union victory. So a tripartite bargain was struck whose purpose (for the government) was to restrain wage and price growth enough to limit inflation, but not so much as to leave workers dissatisfied.2</p><p>When business, labor, and government come together to determine how much goods would cost and workers would be paid, the result can hardly be described as a market process. The postwar years of the 1950s and '60s were the age of \"monopoly capitalism,\" as the Marxists then called it, or, less polemically, an era of \"administered prices.\" The cartelization of American industry had its negative effects, including the technological stagnation of US manufacturing and the irresistible rise of inflation, culminating in the chaotic 1970s. But in any case, it served many American workers well and, at least for a time, helped produce a more egalitarian country. But when it finally came crashing down, it took working-class incomes with it-a disaster from which we have yet to recover.3</p><p>In recent years, however, a different account of the origin and nature of economic inequality has become popular in some quarters. Dubbed the new antitrust or new Brandeisianism (after Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who laid the intellectual foundation for vigorous market reform), this approach offers a distinctive, simple, and insistent diagnosis of economic polarization. Rather than emphasize the punitive turn of social welfare programs, the loss of union density, and the underlying structural pressures on employers to suppress wages, it instead argues that equality was undermined by the renascence of monopoly power. Monopolies today need not swallow a whole supply chain into a single corporation; instead, they work when a large firm dominates smaller ones, dictating to them without needing to own them. Astride their respective economic sectors, tech companies control our minds, retail giants like Amazon and Walmart enforce terms of production on suppliers and terms of purchase on consumers, and Wall Street firms extract a punishing toll from every movement of money and suck value from the whole economy. Together, they are eroding the integrity of our political and economic systems.4</p><p>In his new book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</emphasis>, Matt Stoller, one of the most irrepressible members of this new generation of Brandeisians, elevates this argument to something like a theory of history. For Stoller, all of American history-and much of world history-has been defined by a struggle between monopoly and democracy. Where property is concentrated, its owners warp the public institutions that exist around them, allowing them to concentrate property still more. At the extreme ends of this quantitative process, the monopolist captures the state itself, with sovereignty a mere trapping of consolidated market power in the hands of a feudal lord or fascist dictator.5</p><p>Over the history of the United States, Stoller finds the greatest nemesis of such authoritarian pretensions in America's anti-monopoly tradition. For him, anti-monopoly is fundamental to the fabric of American democracy. It began with the American Revolution (which he describes as a revolt against the monopoly privileges of British merchants), gained a mass following with Jefferson, became radicalized with the Populists in the late 19th century, tasted power with the Progressives, and culminated in the New Deal and the mid-20th-century US economy. Minimizing the centrality of corporatist coordination to that era, Stoller insists that the New Deal was fundamentally an antitrust program. Its vigorous regulators broke the power that the robber barons accumulated in the 19th century and drove the moneychangers from the temple of democracy, thereby ushering in a golden age of competition and freedom-until this agenda was undermined by scurrilous and arrogant schemers in both parties, who opened the way for a massive reassertion of corporate power beginning in the 1970s.6</p><p>What's so telling about this narrative is not only the fact that the golden age of competition that Stoller wishes to restore is the very same period in which great, vertically integrated oligopolies ruled the economy in coordination with one another, labor unions, and the state; it is also that his expansive view of economic power still can't find a place for class conflict-which, although invisible to Stoller, was often the engine of downward redistribution in the midcentury boom. Because he does not grasp how the fundamental antagonism between labor and capital underlies other forms of economic rivalry, Stoller misunderstands the nature of the New Deal and the legacy it leaves us. As a result, his book offers us a useful guide to some of the ills of concentrated market power today but does not ultimately come to terms with their real origin or present any viable political response.7</p><p>toller initially gained some prominence in the early 2000s as a member of the cohort of progressive political bloggers who found their voice in the early years of the Iraq War. Stoller at first supported the war, but he soon became horrified by how the Democratic establishment rolled over for the agenda of George W. Bush's administration, and he and a set of his peers-writers like Matt Yglesias, Ezra Klein, and Markos Moulitsas-helped mobilize support for progressive reforms and the Democrats who championed them.8</p><p>Although Stoller continued to see himself as an outsider in the years after Barack Obama's election, he, like the other members of this cohort, joined the intellectual and political ranks of the DC machine and managed to establish their careers before the Great Recession started in 2008. Moulitsas, the founder of the website <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Daily Kos</emphasis>, became an unofficial Democratic Party operative. Klein and Yglesias emerged as celebrated policy journalists, eventually launching the mammoth operation at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Vox</emphasis>. By the end of the decade, Stoller, for his part, was working as an economic policy staffer in Congress. From this perch, he watched with dismay as the Obama White House did little to break from the prevailing economic consensus. With Clinton administration veterans Larry Summers, Rahm Emanuel, and Timothy Geithner back in power, Obama and his team of economic advisers sided with the lords of finance, directing unimaginable streams of money to shore up Wall Street while letting millions of Americans lose their homes to foreclosure.9</p><p>This marked a second phase in Stoller's politicization. \"It seemed clear to many of us during the bailouts,\" he notes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis>, \"that the public would turn vehemently against the political establishment for taking their property, their stake in America, and so it has.\" Stoller left Capitol Hill and fell into the orbit of the anti-monopoly thinkers and activists affiliated with the New America Foundation, particularly journalist Barry Lynn, whose 2009 book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction</emphasis> argued that hidden monopolies have insinuated themselves throughout our economy. For Stoller and this emerging anti-monopoly clique, the betrayal that took place after 2008 had a much longer history. In the 1970s, an affluent faction of Democrats helped kill the party's \"populist soul.\"10</p><p>Stoller began to formulate this thesis in historical terms in a widely shared essay that appeared in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Atlantic</emphasis> shortly before Trump won the 2016 election. Historians like Judith Stein and Lily Geismer told versions of this story before, arguing that in the 1970s middle-class professionals wrested control of the Democratic Party away from its blue-collar social base and unleashed a set of market-centric reforms and deregulatory schemes. But Stoller offers a somewhat different analysis: The transformation that these middle-class professionals helped to enact tilted the balance of class power, in his view, because it allowed the advance of market concentration. And he tells this story primarily through the perspective of Wright Patman, a Democratic congressman from rural East Texas, a \"proud Hillbilly\" and dogged foe of market consolidation and financial power. As Stoller announces early in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis>, he sees this history \"through [Patman's] eyes.\" In his telling, Democrats lost their way when the yuppie progressives often called the \"Watergate Babies\" swept into power in 1974 and ousted Patman from his Banking Committee chairmanship, with grave consequences. \"The destruction of the anti-monopoly and anti-bank tradition in the Democratic Party,\" Stoller writes, \"has also cleared the way for the greatest concentration of economic power in a century.\"11</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis>, he retells the story of Patman and the fall of the New Deal Democratic Party. But Stoller also aspires to something far grander. He insists that almost all of American history can be understood in terms of the struggle between the forces of monopoly on the one hand and democracy on the other, beginning with the feud between the aristocratic Alexander Hamilton and the democratic Thomas Jefferson and extending into the 20th century, with the rise of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, tribunes of the people in the age of mass democracy. (Glossed over or ignored outright here are the central roles in the Jeffersonian popular tradition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">g\u00e9nocidaire</emphasis> Andrew Jackson and of pro-slavery politics.) It is, in fact, with Wilson that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> opens in earnest, with his campaign for the presidency in 1912, when he faced off against Theodore Roosevelt (as well as William Howard Taft and Eugene Debs) over the question of what was to be done about the accumulation of economic power in the hands of the few. Railroad and coal barons mutilated their workers in spectacular workplace horrors, while bankers lorded it over society like European aristocrats. \"We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!\" Roosevelt declared, and for him, this battle required introducing a corporatist system that regulated but did not break up the new industrial giants. For Wilson, who embraced the ideas of Brandeis, it meant splitting them up-what he called a \"New Freedom.\"12</p><p>In Stoller's rendering of this story, Wilson attempted to launch something like a New Deal and might have pulled it off if World War I hadn't gotten in the way. But America's entrance into the war in 1917 and the economic chaos and reactionary politics that it unleashed allowed the reassertion of power by the forces of monopoly. \"Wilson, so energetic at the beginning of his term,\" Stoller writes, \"could do nothing by the end of his tenure except lie in bed as his administration jailed thousands of innocents, and as the plutocrats swiftly subverted the new order he had imposed just a few years earlier.\" Apparently, the Wilson administration's reform agenda rested on the vision and energy of but a single figure, and his physical decline brought the New Freedom down with it. The egalitarian ambitions of Wilson and the anti-monopoly tradition would have to be put on hold as Andrew Mellon, the last of the great robber barons, rose to power and, as secretary of the treasury, unleashed the oligarchic forces of the 1920s. Wealth accumulated at the top, while the common people suffered-a regime Stoller calls \"Mellonism.\"13</p><p>With the Depression, agency in the narrative shifts again, from Mellon and his accomplices to a new generation of anti-monopolists, including many in Franklin Roosevelt's brain trust and, of course, Wright Patman, Stoller's East Texas hero. Patman arrived in Washington in 1929, the year of the crash, and almost immediately set about bird-dogging Mellon. Patman supported the marchers of the Bonus Army, advocated cheap credit for farmers, and wrote with Arkansas Senator Joe Robinson a landmark anti-monopoly bill in 1936 that barred predatory pricing in retail.14</p><p>A beneficiary of the South's racist one-party system, Patman may have been a champion of economic competition, but he also spent decades in power without much political competition, accruing seniority and rising to the chairmanship of the Banking Committee. (This was the reason he drew the ire of the Watergate Babies in 1975; they wanted to eject the Southerners from their powerful sinecures.) Stoller unconvincingly suggests his great man was only as racist as he was obliged to be politically and was appreciated by his black constituents, even if Patman was, after all, one of only five Texas Democrats in the House to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto denouncing the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis> decision. (Seventeen refused.)15</p><p>One wishes Stoller had paused to contemplate why anti-monopoly tended to find its most vigorous advocates in white Southerners like Wilson, Robinson, and Patman. He suggests this is merely a coincidence and that there existed no historical relationship between white supremacy and pro-competitive politics. In part, this is because Stoller really is interested only in telling us how the relentlessly populist Patman's advocacy helped shape the New Deal. \"Patman brought forward what the farmers of the 1890s demanded of their society, a democracy with an egalitarian system of free enterprise, where small business had the same shot as Andrew Mellon to compete. He stood up to Mellon. He stood for the plain people, and the veterans. And in doing so, he destroyed the legitimacy of the plutocrats that dominated America.\" Summarizing the emerging egalitarian era, Stoller observes, \"Finally, after the second great war of the century, democracy had taken hold in the commercial sphere.\"16</p><p>If this doesn't match your idea of the origins of the New Deal era, you're not alone. Wishing anti-monopoly to be a politics for all times and places, Stoller cannot allow it any historical specificity. He does not satisfactorily wrestle with the fact that Patman and his antitrust attorney allies formed only one part of the New Deal coalition. Anti-monopoly was a part of a much larger political spectrum, which also included corporatism of just the kind Stoller abhors. Distinguishing among these elements is possible, and one can argue that one is preferable to the other. But doing so would also require acknowledging the existence and logic of another dimension of the New Deal beyond antitrust and corporatism-and that would mean considering labor and class.17</p><p>n <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis>'s second half, Stoller gives us his story of how the New Deal's anti-monopoly democracy was unmade. Some of the beats are familiar: His narrative dwells on the rise of the Chicago School of economics-what Stoller calls \"the new Mellonism\"-where American antitrust law was reinvented by characters like law professor Aaron Director, economist George Stigler, and jurist Robert Bork. The result was the law and economics movement, which played an enormous role in changing doctrine in general and elevating the significance of consumer welfare in particular. These thinkers constructed a consumer welfare standard for antitrust cases that didn't necessarily focus on big or small but rather cheap and thus became the cover under which market power reasserted itself. (Whatever else Amazon is, it is cheap and convenient for the consumer.)18</p><p>But the Chicago School neoliberals and the politicians and judges they influenced were given valuable cover, Stoller argues, by intellectuals on the left, who saw in large-scale economic concentration the basis of a social order beyond capitalism-and saw in populism only backward-looking reaction. Stoller reserves pages of bizarre vitriol here for sociologist C. Wright Mills, historian Richard Hofstadter, and economist John Kenneth Galbraith, whom he blames for eroding the ideological basis of antitrust in the postwar years. \"Hofstadter and Galbraith together,\" he tells us in a puzzling passage, \"created a new language and new frame of analysis designed to eliminate the antimonopoly tradition in American politics. A new villain, the grubby racist small businessman, had replaced the money trust.\" As Stoller concludes later on, \"'Beautiful smugness' is how John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter persuaded a generation to give up their liberties.\" Even if Stoller's readings of these thinkers represented them accurately, this would seem an awfully large role to assign to a sociologist, a historian, and an economist-even unusually prominent ones.19</p><p>While neoliberalism germinated in Chicago and smug intellectuals fulminated in New York, finance regrouped. \"Set free from their wartime constraints, and then from the constraints imposed by White House control over the Fed, bankers tried to seize more power,\" Stoller writes, and financiers like Citibank chief Walter Wriston and conglomerate mogul Saul Steinberg invented financial tools to manipulate the market-including the certificate of deposit, a bondlike instrument that allowed Citibank to evade regulations meant to limit bank size. When Patman came after these bankers, his success was mixed; they had learned from the experience of the 1930s. Stoller writes:20</p><p>Wriston didn't appear as a robber baron, but a cosmopolitan executive who believed in racial tolerance, liked rock 'n' roll, and wanted to be a responsible business leader in a technologically advanced society. Citibank, as he told governors and local politicians, didn't pollute, and it went without mention that the bank didn't send soldiers to Vietnam.21</p><p>Perceiving an intersection between a fashionable cultural progressivism born out of the 1960s and a renascent economic oligarchy, Stoller continues, affluent, snobby liberals teamed up with bankers against the American people. By the early 1970s, everyone from Ralph Nader and the Watergate Babies to enlightened bankers and Chicago School economists were working together to bring the curtain down on economic democracy. With Patman ousted in 1975, Jimmy Carter deregulating key markets shortly thereafter, and Democrats taking up the Chicago School's ideas, corporate power took off. Unshackled from regulatory constraints, big-box retail spread across small-town America, while banks and more exotic financial firms began to reassert themselves, growing in size and power. From there, Stoller offers us a straight line to the election of Trump, who fed on the democratic decay that set in once the regulatory state had been dismantled. As Stoller puts it in his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Atlantic</emphasis> essay, \"The story of Patman's ousting is part of the larger story of how the Democratic Party helped to create today's shockingly disillusioned and sullen public, a large chunk of whom is now marching for Donald Trump.\"22</p><p>In this respect, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> is an ambitious and risky undertaking that proffers a century-long narrative encompassing virtually every aspect of American political and economic life. But Stoller tends to tell his story from the perspective of individual politicians, intellectuals, and millionaires-Patman, Wilson, Brandeis, Mellon, and the like. Structural forces recede, personalities grow in importance, and it becomes difficult to tell why anything is happening.23</p><p>For this reason, great changes that Stoller would like to trace tend to go unexplained except in terms of the greed and corruption, or farsightedness and altruism, of particular individuals. Wilson's Federal Reserve, for example, was a good idea-\"designed to move power over the economy from Wall Street to the people\"-until it fell into the hands of \"shortsighted private bankers who could not or would not stop speculative bubbles.\" (Why? How?) The defeat of Wilson's ostensibly benevolent peace plan is also attributed to the machinations of robber barons. \"[Henry Clay] Frick and Mellon believed that America should use its power solely to enhance American financial interests, not to engage in some scheme for world peace. The two men saw opposition to the [Treaty of Versailles] as a way to discredit the Democrats and drive them from power.\" Mellon then became the most powerful man in the country-\"King Andrew\"-setting the stage in turn for the stock market crash of 1929. Everything in this narrative is about market power, and market power is about greed and opportunity.24</p><p>Yet when one attempts to peer beneath this layer of individual action, avaricious or heroic, Stoller's narrative begins to unravel. In order to conjure up a united front of the common people against corporate power, he repeatedly collapses the distinction between the problem of monopoly and the problem of class. Again and again, he cites capital's offenses against labor as evidence of the need for anti-monopoly measures, writing phrases like \"small businessman and blue-collar worker\" as if the reader will not notice he has named two separate things.25</p><p>Stoller isn't wrong in asserting that there were many working-class people invested in breaking the power of the robber barons, but anti-monopoly as it emerged as a mass movement in the late 19th\u00a0century was only one component of what was often called \"the social question,\" or if you were less inclined to euphemism, \"the labor question.\" To be sure, agrarian rebels demanded the death of the money power, while huge strike waves shook the country in 1877 and again in 1886, developing into general strikes in multiple cities. The United States saw repeated instances of workers shutting down large sections of the nation's rail network in wild, out-of-control confrontations. Gun battles between unions and company thugs became more and more common, as in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892 and Cripple Creek, Colorado, in 1894. But at issue in these labor conflicts was not just the cartelization of the economy but the whole system of relationships that made up America's social order, in particular the \"wages system\"-that is, capitalist labor markets-and its bouts of wage cuts and unemployment. When workers in these struggles denounced monopolies, they often did so because they viewed concentrated capital as part of a deeper problem: capitalism itself. They struck because industrial wage labor was a new form of domination, and they wished to diminish and eventually end it.26</p><p>For Stoller, however, inequality and the class tensions it unleashed are made not inside the process of production but in the \"commercial sphere.\" Industry and commerce, however, are obviously not the same thing, and this conflation leads him to serious conceptual problems. The political issues that arise from production occur between labor and capital-over wages, hours, safety, unionization, workers' control, and so on-and are quite distinct from conflicts over market power, which occur between capital and capital and, as the legal scholar Lina Khan put it, concern \"product quality, variety and innovation\" as well as prices. The two are related to each other, as when labor markets take on monopsonistic characteristics, but they remain distinct. Yet wherever he looks, Stoller sees the two spheres as one and accordingly vexed by the same question: what to do about the robber barons-which is to say, the issue of concentration at the top. Social inequality, the relationship between the classes, and the maldistribution of economic and political power are all collapsed into a question of the bigness and badness of the biggest, baddest members of the elite.27</p><p>He is also correct in asserting that anti-monopoly sentiment has enjoyed a large social base in American history, but it was not among \"the people\" in general and certainly not the working class in particular. Rather, it was a politics that arose among several distinct social and economic groups as they came under increasing economic pressure around the turn of the 20th century and settled on trust-busting as the instrument of their relief. They were not all of one kind. There were farmers and craftsmen, shopkeepers and small businessmen, spread out across small towns and the countryside. These groups linked up with Progressive lawyers and professionals in the first third of the 20th century-especially those influenced by Brandeis-who believed that market regulation could limit the power of corporations in order to produce a stable, harmonious social order.28</p><p>Yet since Stoller takes as a given that anti-monopoly populists speak on behalf of the people as an organic whole, he presents Patman and the antitrust activists in the New Deal as the entirety of that project's egalitarian thrust. Invisible in his account is the Northern social democratic politics of millions of working-class Americans that-I think I'm on safe ground here-was also quite influential in shaping that era's policies. Whether or not you rate antitrust as important, it still beggars belief to see it as a more significant force in the remaking of American society in the 1930s than the insurgency of millions of industrial workers and the wave of reforms they won: the National Labor Relations Act, which established union rights; the Social Security Act, which created the eponymous program as well as family assistance and unemployment insurance; the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the 40-hour workweek and the minimum wage and banned child labor; and, indirectly, legislation touching on housing and urban development, veterans' policy, and more.29</p><p>A telling example of Stoller's oversight in this regard comes in his narrative of the Southern crusade of small businesses and farmers against the predations of the A&amp;P market chain. While relating this story, Stoller mentions as an aside that the giant chain struck an alliance with the American Federation of Labor and various progressive consumer and cooperative groups to strengthen its hand against the antitrusters. This anti-anti-monopoly alliance, which wedded the interests of labor to those of a large corporation, represents the spirit and logic of the New Deal at least as well as Patman does. Stoller, however, cannot see it as anything but opportunism. The fact that Patman supported the Taft-Hartley Act, establishing right-to-work laws and hobbling the labor movement, also goes unexplored.30</p><p>To be fair, part of the problem here is that the New Deal was itself a fundamentally equivocal and contradictory regime. It attempted to marry market regulation and antitrust with an implicit corporatism. While breaking up and regulating some markets, liberal policy-makers continued to pursue high-level social bargains among capital, labor, and consumers, explicitly until 1935 and tacitly and indirectly for decades thereafter. Stoller hyperbolically draws parallels between the former efforts-those that accepted or even encouraged corporatist social compromises-with fascism and then proceeds to ignore them as a key component of Democratic rule from the New Deal to the Great Society. But his elision of the centrality of labor-management conflict and compromise also leads him to elevate antitrust from a component of liberal policy to a synonym for democracy and freedom.31</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> finds a key case study, for example, in the way the federal government set up competitors to Alcoa's aluminum monopoly in the 1940s. This move, meant to keep the supply of aluminum flowing for the war machine, is presented as substantiation of Stoller's reimagined version of World War\u00a0II as a global struggle between monopoly and free competition. (One wonders where the Soviet Union is in this account.) But as historian Jonathan Bean observes, two-thirds of major war production contracts went to the largest 100 corporations, and two-thirds of research and development money went to 68 firms. Small manufacturers shrank dramatically over the war years in terms of relative employment while large ones grew. After the war, when it came time to reconvert the $17\u00a0billion of publicly owned defense industries to privatized civilian production, two-thirds of their economic value went to 87\u00a0firms. Bean writes, \"The federal government sold all of its synthetic rubber facilities to the Big Four rubber companies and allowed U.S. Steel to purchase 71 percent of all the publicly built steel plants.\" The steel monopoly, as we already noted, became a key mechanism in the balance between capital and labor struck by New Deal liberals, allowing for wage increases for the organized workers who formed the base of the Democratic Party. Yet you simply will not encounter in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> the overwhelming counterevidence that suggests the New Deal was marked by such social democratic features balanced on oligopolistic markets.32</p><p>All of this is to not discount the fact that the New Deal experimented in antitrust efforts more actively than what came before it or after it, but it did so while helping to bolster a monopolistic and quasi-corporatist economic system. The New Deal and its heirs, in other words, rested on multiple pillars. White Southern Democrats wanted cheap manufactured goods, competitive markets, and decentralized power that protected their racial order in the South; the multiethnic, multiracial, and working-class coalition of Northern Democrats wanted high wages and stable employment in industry. The tension between these two, structural as well as ideological in nature, eventually consumed the party in the 1970s in the economic chaos called \"stagflation.\"33</p><p>or someone making a political argument by way of history, Stoller can view monopoly quite ahistorically. For many, monopoly is a more or less inevitable result of capitalist development. Marxists have argued that market consolidation is a mechanism by which capitalism has managed its periodic crises. By \"socializing\" production, or summoning together the once dispersed productive powers of society into a collective force, monopoly at once advanced capitalism's development and produced a kind of socialism in embryo trapped by its private ownership structure. For capitalists, this was true too. J.P. Morgan saw the rise of monopoly as an irresistible element of capitalism. Breaking up the trusts was as impossible, he said, as unscrambling an omelet. As a historical phenomenon-that is, developing over time in relation to particular contexts of events-monopoly has qualities that make it difficult to reverse. On this view, anti-monopoly is useful only within a larger account of the development and trajectory of capitalism itself, of which monopoly is just a symptom.34</p><p>But for Stoller, monopoly is something that exists mostly outside time and the particularities of political economy. The essence of monopolization can be found in both medieval feudalism and 20th-century fascism. China, too, Stoller tells us, is just one giant monopoly. The phenomenon has no distinct cause other than the greed of the powerful and the power of the greedy; it is merely the name for what happens when greed and power meet. It has, in this sense, no history that can be related except through the machinations of individuals, nefarious or heroic.35</p><p>Operating with an anti-monopoly analysis but not a historical one, Stoller as a result constantly gets things only half right. \"What of the party of the people, the Democrats?\" he asks as he moves into the 1980s and '90s. \"Throughout American history, the triumph of plutocrats in a decade provoked a backlash, and the opposing party would win a series of elections and reorient political economy. But the Chicago School has dismantled this fail-safe.\" Stoller is of course correct that the Democrats failed utterly to channel the miseries of neoliberalism into a political challenge and instead have served as handmaidens to worsening inequality. But the idea that this collaboration is due to the influence of the Chicago School in particular-as opposed to much larger structural forces that have prevailed around the world-is not an analysis; it's a conspiracy theory. It also excludes almost all of the important reasons Democrats turned rightward and implies no theory of what might be done to counteract this. No vision of politics follows from the insight that elites sometimes scheme and accrue influence. This becomes a genuinely political idea only when it can be used to develop a specific vision of conflicting interests, friends who might be organized and enemies who must be divided and overcome. \"They're for the powerful, we're for the people\" is something Al Gore said in his acceptance speech for the Democrats' 2000 presidential nomination; one hopes for something a bit more precise in a 600-page book.36</p><p>The ahistorical and thus apolitical quality of Stoller's book becomes even more apparent when he attempts to generalize the perfectly sound idea of breaking up some monopolies into a transcendent principle of democratic life: that the basis for all forms of freedom-social, economic, political-lies in open access to commerce. \"Each of us,\" he rhapsodizes in his conclusion, \"is a worker, a businessperson, a consumer, and a citizen.\" I am not a businessperson, and I suspect this may be true for many of my readers too. As far as I can tell, even Stoller is not a businessperson. Many in this country are, of course, also not citizens, as we are grimly reminded every day. Even in the working class, millions are not workers in the strictest sense. Many students, incarcerated people, disabled people, retirees, and the unemployed do not perform wage work.37</p><p>Yet Stoller's eye can track only the disposal of property, and in it he finds liberty itself. Capital encounters merely other capital, big or small. The vast majority of us who lack property that we can live off and thus must sell our labor power to survive are visible, in this analysis, only if we're conceived of as tiny capitalists. Stoller's history, as a result, is blind to the structural coercion of workers that brings them into their encounter with capital and gives capitalism its fundamental character. For those of us who cannot live off our property, the economy is not where we become free through trade; it is where we become unfree through work or the lack of it. Property is a relationship, not an object. The liberty it grants some is always domination for others. The Jeffersonian smallholder class, for example, was built on the backs (or the land) of women, children, slaves, low-wage and migrant workers, and indigenous people. A focus solely on market relations loses sight of this political and economic domination.38</p><p>Stoller's framework also causes him to present anti-monopoly as a principle transcending differences between the right and the left-an approach that gives space to a nationalist vision of the people as an integral whole and who are beset by insidious outsiders. On the hunt for anti-monopolists of all shapes and sizes, he finds an ally in Senator Josh Hawley, a \"national conservative\" who delivered a thinly veiled anti-Semitic speech about the \"cosmopolitan\" attack on America's \"common culture,\" because of Hawley's criticism of Big Tech. (It seems likely that Stoller is naive here rather than cynical, but it can be only one of the two.) In the same vein, he has become an advocate of confrontation with China, writing in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Foreign Policy</emphasis>, \"The era of strong private corporate power is over. Public power is being reasserted over U.S. corporations. The only question is whether the public power that assumes control of Western corporations, and thus Western society, is American or Chinese.\"39</p><p>One need not applaud the regime in Beijing to dread where this goes. And Stoller also regularly bemoans the effects of monopoly on America's weapons-making capacity and recently criticized tech workers for protesting their employers' work with the Pentagon. \"Warfare tech and AI isn't necessarily about killing,\" he explained on Twitter, \"and weakening the military institutions isn't the right way to change *war policy.*\"40</p><p>Throughout the book, Stoller distinguishes his anti-monopoly politics from the socialist and social democratic traditions of the left. Since he sees the tradition stretching from Jefferson to Patman as the core of democratic politics in America, anything that falls outside the spectrum between Hamilton and Jefferson is invisible, an illegitimate infiltrator, or an especially curious specimen of Hamiltonism or Jeffersonism. If you follow his commentary, you'll know, for example, that he's convinced that W.E.B. Du Bois's classic <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Reconstruction</emphasis>-a book that speaks approvingly of Reconstruction as a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\"-is merely an entry in the Jeffersonian tradition, contrary to Du Bois's Marxist intentions. This reading rests precisely on a misunderstanding of the desire of freed slaves to own land as an impulse toward small business rather than the wish to be free of the supervisor's lash.41</p><p>t is clear from the outset of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> that Stoller very evidently wishes for a more just and equal world, and many of his solutions-breaking up and regulating the big banks and tech companies, for example-would be far preferable to the status quo. But he does not explain any of the reasons an anti-monopoly politics might win or achieve any staying power. If all of American history is defined by the struggle between the great heroes of anti-monopoly democracy and the avarice of Mellonism, then why would powerful and greedy men not machinate once more against antitrust laws? Why wouldn't disdainful intellectuals conspire against the people's cause yet again? If the prevalence of monopoly, as Stoller insists, bears no relation to the larger social and economic environment and is purely a voluntary choice, then there's no reason to believe that anti-monopoly can produce a stable resolution to the problem of corporate power. From where might antitrust politics draw social and political power with a mass base of farmers, craftsmen, and small businessmen long gone? What might bind the people as a whole together to confront their overlords? By way of employment in some cases, low prices or convenience in others, the monopolies that he detests have sunk their roots into large sections of society. Come after Amazon, and you come after its tens of millions of users too.42</p><p>The socialism that Stoller dismisses emerged precisely in answer to these problems. It contends that capitalism gives rise-not once but repeatedly-to a potentially coherent and antagonistic social force capable of collective action. This is the working class. Because capitalism produces a larger population over time that cannot survive from its own property and therefore joins many of these people at sites of collective labor, it makes it possible for them to organize and then to exercise leverage and political leadership over other sectors of society. (This is the reason that the most exciting intellectual work in antitrust is being done by scholars who work on market power specifically in employment, such as Sanjukta Paul, Suresh Naidu, and Marshall Steinbaum.) One may criticize the socialist's faith in the working class as politically naive or empirically inaccurate. But in any case, socialism (and beneath it Marxism as well) contains a theory of politics-a definite account of friends and enemies and why each is what it is-whereas Stoller's populism does not. This is why socialists have proved to be so much less prone to deviations into jingoism and conspiracy theory than their populist peers.43</p><p>One might also add that socialism and anti-monopoly are not necessarily opposed; In recent history, as well in the New Deal era, the two have blended in a combined opposition to the current economic and political order. For both sides, this blending together has been both opportunistic and fruitful. The presence in the presidential race of candidates who approximately represent each ideology illustrates the dynamic of this marriage of convenience. The socialist who speaks of class war allows the anti-monopolist to leverage her plans for fixing it into popularity; in turn, the plan maker must mimic the socialist's positions in order for her gambit to succeed, thus validating his ideas. Each gets to obfuscate usefully through the presence of the other and because they share enemies: Wall Street and its political representatives.44</p><p>But Stoller's book also demonstrates some of the underlying differences. Anti-monopolists oppose the economic elite but not the social system that gave rise to it. Likewise, between socialism and anti-monopoly lies a vast difference in analysis about the nature of the state and, indeed, power itself. For the anti-monopolist, the state is a shield for the people against their plutocratic enemies; power inheres in the state, and it is only a question of whether the people capture it through elections. The anti-monopolist agenda is therefore to put the good expert into office, where she may wield the regulatory power of the state for the common good. For the socialist, on the other hand, the state is not neutral. Its purpose and nature are to serve the interests of the ruling class. If it can be remade to serve the working class, this project cannot be achieved without enormous social conflict, and this change can come only from below, not just through elections but through sustained attacks on authority at every level: in workplaces, schools, families, neighborhoods, and beyond. Friendly elements within the state may lend important support to such struggles, and this is one of the reasons socialists seek state power. But socialism cannot be achieved solely by means of such power.45</p><p>Which of these analyses you believe (and which diagnosis you accept) is, in part, the result of the different historical narratives that we tell. If you think the problem we face is something like \"crony capitalism\" or \"money in politics,\" then there is one weird trick that will fix it: reining in the too-powerful corporations-often by using laws already on the books-in order to get back to the people's business. This program, often presented as structural change, nonetheless represents an explicitly superficial approach: the idea that our economy has acquired a predatory, parasitic stratum at its top that needs to be stripped off, allowing the underlying system to work as intended. Explicitly or not, it's the promise of a return to a lost utopia of markets, a society without fundamental antagonisms. If, on the other hand, you think our problems are deeper, woven more fundamentally into the structure of how we live together-which things and people we value and which we discard, who must wear the saddle and who gets to ride-then there's no going back. If the problem lies with capitalism as a system and not specific malicious capitalists, then we've got to embark on an adventure of a different kind, one that leads us not back to the comforts of midcentury America but somewhere wild and new. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> will not help us find the way.46</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-336404</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1K-NJJ1-DXR3-200N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Just as most mainstream web services allow users to sign in using their Google or Facebook accounts, Apple introduced a feature called \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/\"> Sign In with Apple</url>.\" Unlike the other two, Apple senior VP Craig Federighi promised that Apple's version was privacy focused.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google and Facebook's options are in effect data-sharing agreements between them and the services that deploy their sign-in methods. In exchange for Google and Facebook handling complicated, high-stakes things like log-in security, Google and Facebook get privileged access and can see additional user activity across the web. The sites you use these sign-in methods on can also request access to data on your Google and Facebook profiles as well. It's a mutually beneficial relationship that makes tracking, and ad-targeting, much easier.</p><p>Apple's login system, on the other hand, pledges to only share a users name and email address with anyone who utilizes their sign-in option, and promises that it \"will not track users' activity in [a developer's] app or website.\" In addition, if you choose, Apple will mask your email address with a randomly generated forwarding address of its own. Masking a user's real email address makes it more difficult to tie that user to other databases. It's akin to calling from a burner phone.</p><p>It's a compelling idea for a populace increasingly concerned about privacy and Big Data. The only problem is that Facebook and Google's sign-in systems are compelling because they let independent developers hook into huge data sets, but Apple's does the exact opposite. So, how do you get developers to use it? The answer is: you force them.</p><p>In an update to the company's App Store review<url normalizedValue=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j\"> guidelines </url>posted yesterday, Apple noted:</p><p>Sign In with Apple will be available for beta testing this summer. It will be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.</p><p>Whether this is good or bad depends on your priorities. If you care about privacy, this is pretty cool. You no longer have to grant access to the accounts that govern much of your digital life to snooping developers or data-reliant giants. And you're guaranteed to have that option because Apple demands it.</p><p>At the same time, well, Apple is demanding it. It's using its walled garden to force developers to adopt this first-party login method, essentially letting Apple take the place of Google or Facebook as an administrator of your data. The primary advantage of Apple's login system right now is not that it makes Apple much stronger; it makes Apple's competitors weaker, by depriving them of crucial user data.</p><p>This \"If Google/Facebook, then Apple\" policy weakens Google and Facebook's ability to harvest data. That's good! But Apple is able to do this by leveraging its enormous platform with hundreds of millions of users and forcing developers to use Apple's own tools. That's bad. As is often the case with these sorts of Big Tech issues, the benefit to individual users is obvious while the broader implications point to a increasing concentration of power. Even without harvesting data like Facebook and Google, Apple becoming the de facto provider of foundational services for countless other websites and companies is powerful and lucrative place to be.</p><p>It's difficult to game out exactly what this will lead to in the future but it gives Apple a lot of potential avenues. It makes it even harder for developers to abandon Apple's storefront. Maybe Apple starts charging developers for the ability to use its sign-in services, or maybe the company does an about face and decides it will start collecting more types of user data for monetization. Apple isn't in dire straits financially, so these are all far-fetched ideas, but at the same time, altruism is not Apple's primary guiding principle. The company scaling up another large platform that it demands developers proliferate and which it could easily leverage later on should be eyed with some skepticism.</p><p>At the same time Apple was holding its keynote yesterday,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-justice-dept-considering-apple-probe-sources-idUSKCN1T42DD\">Reuters</url>reported that the Justice Department is looking at Apple in regard to anti-competitive practices.

It then emerged that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/30/facebook-has-quietly-offering-teenagers-15-month-spy-phones/\">Google had done something similar</url>, able to gain invaluable info on the habits of people using iPhones, the greatest rival to its own Android smartphones.</p><p>In response to this fairly brazen act from Facebook and Google, Apple publicly admonished its rivals for a 'clear breach' of its policies and temporarily revoked access to iOS software for Facebook's internal developers. This was a move reportedly treated as a 'critical' issue within Facebook, as its engineers couldn't launch software.</p><p>The Facebook Research app was then removed from iOS by Facebook, apparently backing down as Apple flexed its muscles. Notably, the app is reportedly still live on Google's Android devices.</p><p>It is the latest in a clear drawing of lines from big tech companies, as consumer confidence in the idea that their privacy is respected is at at all-time low. Apple wants to be seen as the protectors of that faith, with CEO Tim Cook criticising Facebook in the wake of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/30/facebook-has-quietly-offering-teenagers-15-month-spy-phones/\">Cambridge Analytica</url> scandal, calling privacy a 'fundamental human right' and hiring out billboards at CES promising attendees that 'what happens on an iPhone, stays on an iPhone'.</p><p>Apple, of course, has suffered its own embarrassment over privacy concerns recently, with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/30/facebook-has-quietly-offering-teenagers-15-month-spy-phones/\">Facetime video-call bug</url> that allowed diallers access to a recipient's camera and microphone before they even picked up. Frankly, I've never quite forgiven Apple for downloading a U2 album to my phone, which was as much an attack on taste as it was privacy.</p><p>But perception is everything. And Apple is keen to position itself as the company that cares, particularly in the wake of Facebook's repeated flouting of privacy concerns. The relationship between big tech's biggest has always been complicated; a rivalry that also relies on each other as Apple need Facebook and Google's software as much as those companies need Apple's hardware to host them.</p><p>So they have long existed in a tense atmosphere of competition and mutually assured destruction, or at least mutually assured profit loss, should one company take the nuclear option. If Apple are serious about taking Facebook and Google to task, they could feasibly remove access to their apps on iOS devices altogether. Long term may see iPhone users vexed by the removal of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp shifting to Android, but the short term impact on Facebook, as suggested by even the briefest revocation of access to internal apps, would be significant.</p><p>This puts Apple in the strongest position to take a stand against any violations of privacy and it seems to be a stand they are willing to take.</p><p>Is it in self-interest? Of course. Apple's pivot to more service businesses in the wake of shrinking iPhone sales means it needs to fortify trust in what information it will and will not share.</p><p>But the Silicon Valley giants taking it on themselves to address these concerns is absolutely essential. The absence of any real government regulation on tech policy, due in part to politicians continued failure to understand the details, means companies like Facebook have had carte blanche to act as they see fit.</p><p>And why would they change? Even the continued pressure on Facebook has failed to stunt its growth, with a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/30/facebook-has-quietly-offering-teenagers-15-month-spy-phones/\">earnings report</url> saying that revenues for the company were up 30pc from the year before, from $12.8bn to $16.9bn. An estimated 2.7 billion people now use either Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. Or a combination of all three.</p><p>So if companies remain financially invulnerable to privacy scandals, with a lack of government regulation and an increased public willingness to look the other way while scrolling through social media feeds, it becomes morally incumbent on those companies to protect their users.</p><p>There has been lip service, of course, with Facebook hiring Nick Clegg as its latest PR-mouthpiece, offering platitudes and promises that the company will 'learn from its mistakes'.\u00a0Though I'm honestly not sure Facebook could have hired a less convincing apologist-in-chief if it tried.</p><p>And as the clich\u00e9 goes:\u00a0actions speak louder than words. Even if Apple is doing this largely for self-preservation, and concerns over a corporation unilaterally punishing its competition are pertinent, an end goal of improved privacy policy in Silicon Valley and beyond is a worthy one.</p><p>Either way, the lines have been drawn and Apple have the chance to be a pioneer for social change as much as technological. One hopes it is an aim they commit to with a similar gusto.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-51372127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB3-5JV1-JCJY-G38X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><timeReceived>1:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

One big tech and hardware rumor of\u00a0April is that ARM Holdings PLC(NASDAQ: ARMH) could be bought out. </p><p>What the rumor really points to is that Apple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) could be looking to acquire the company. Anything is possible, but at least some caution needs to be considered here. Investors also should consider that the fuel for this rumor may stem back to whether Intel Corp.(NASDAQ: INTC) really ends up acquiring Altera Corp.(NASDAQ: ALTR).&lt;nl/&gt; ARM is the current arms-sale model winner due to its designs being so dominant in smartphones, tablets the Internet of Things, servers, sensors and other embedded devices. It has dozens of key partners, and it will sell to any customer. What is key here, above and beyond that Apple could easily afford the company at any reasonable premium, is that ARM is fabless. It has roughly 3,300 employees and is based in the United Kingdom. Would Apple win by taking on a design shop, knowing that it is possible that other architecture and\u00a0tech-IP could pass it up in the years ahead?&lt;nl/&gt; ALSO READ: 6 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Ahead of Earnings[1]&lt;nl/&gt; ARM's own profile notes that its customers reported that they had shipped 12 billion ARM-based chips in 2014, an increase of 16% on 2013. Just under half of those chips were said to be shipped into mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, where ARM has a high market share. An increasing number of chips were shipped into new markets, including enterprise networking infrastructure and embedded intelligent devices, such as microcontrollers and chips for the Internet of Things.&lt;nl/&gt; An article from Motley Fool's U.K. operations gave the logic on Tuesday as to why an Apple-ARM deal might make sense[2]. At least that may be the start of the rumor mill.&lt;nl/&gt; The real issue goes right\u00a0back to Inteland Altera. Investors are still wondering if, or when, a deal will be announced. This merger could easily bring more challenges competitively in what is already a highly competitive chip and processor market globally. The recent collaborative efforts between Inteland Micron Technology Inc.(NASDAQ: MU) just add that much fuel to the fire.&lt;nl/&gt; One additional issue in an Apple-ARM deal, and in an Intel-Altera deal, is regulatory hurdles in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The European Union, which may have different goals than the United Kingdom, seems absolutely\u00a0emphatic on being as protectionist as it can get away with. Quite simply, it looks as though European regulators are doing everything they can to\u00a0bide time for European technology companies to keep relevance in the ever-changing world of technology. Have you wondered about all those billions of euro fines that Europe is trying to milk out of U.S. technology giants?&lt;nl/&gt; ALSO READ: Ahead of Earnings, Which Chip Stock Is Best Positioned?[3]&lt;nl/&gt; Apple is the world's largest company by market capitalization at $731 billion. Some analysts have already hinted that Apple could become the world's first $1 trillion company. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently added Apple to its list of 30 giants, so obviously it is hoping that Apple can carry the day to much higher values. Oh, and those bullish analysts are modeling Apple's growth on a standalone basis rather than with major acquisitions.&lt;nl/&gt; What Apple would secure here, if it were to acquire ARM, is a leadership position in the architecture and intellectual property around processors and systems on a chip and the like. Still, being so dominant in the end consumer products might draw a line in the sand with other consumer electronics companies \u2014 back to those regulatory concerns.&lt;nl/&gt; ARM's American depositary shares were up almost 4% at $50.70 on about 1.9 million shares after about 90 minutes of trading in New York. The stock has a 52-week range of $37.75 to $54.64, and a consensus price target of $56.65. ARM's current market cap of $23.7 billion is certainly not too large for Apple. It would also be a way for Apple to use some of its cash that is locked up overseas without having to worry about any 35% repatriation tax.&lt;nl/&gt; The question is how much a company will pay to buy $1.3 billion in total revenues from last year. Some $497 million came from licensing, and $535 million came from royalty collections. Thomson Reuters has consensus revenue estimates of $1.47 billion in 2015 and $1.69 billion in 2016. With Apple expected to have revenues of $226 billion in 2015, does spending $23 billion to $30 billion justify adding only another $2 billion in annual revenues in the coming years?&lt;nl/&gt; ALSO READ: Credit Suisse's Top Pick Technology Stocks to Buy Now[4]&lt;nl/&gt;

Without knowing every argument he wants to make, it\u2019s impossible to respond specifically. But, there is one important class of people that Barr and others like him should certainly keep in mind when they pursue cases like this: consumers. And, while regulators should remain the \u2018cop on the beat\u2019 protecting against the exertion of monopoly power, \u2018bigness\u2019 alone isn\u2019t a bad thing.</p><p><br/>Indeed, the efficiencies generated by \u201cbig tech\u201d provide significant benefits that could be lost if regulators ignore the effect on consumers. For example, Instagram successfully [2] pivoted from desktop to mobile services\u00a0after its acquisition. After it was purchased, Whole Foods allowed the world\u2019s largest online retailer to pair with brick and mortar stores to facilitate the home delivery of groceries [3], which certainly came in handy for many families locked down on stay-at-home orders because of the pandemic. Google\u2019s expansion from what began as a search engine has allowed users to integrate word processing, email, calendars, web browsing and a wide variety of other services into a single experience.<br/>Of course, these expansions of service into different markets do raise issues for competition. After all, these efficiencies and the network effects present in many social media networks can make it difficult for small firms both to enter the market and to offer similar services at competitive prices. And to be clear, if Google\u2019s conduct served to illegally retain a monopoly in a defined market, the Department of Justice should bring an antitrust claim against the company. That said, the general concerns that currently appear to be driving competition policy have merely to do with the size of these companies alone, rather than with any specific monopolistic behaviors.<br/>This is a dangerous oversimplification because when companies\u2014even big ones\u2014are prohibited from competing, consumers suffer. For example, the success of a particular company on the market is often achieved precisely because the firm manages to innovate or manage its resources in such a way as to provide a better service\u2014often at a lower price\u2014or in a way that provides more value to the consumer. Such behaviors should be encouraged, not punished.<br/>That is why antitrust cases entail complex market and economic analyses to examine how the supposed anti-competitive action affects competition and consumers. For this reason, it is unsurprising that an arbitrary deadline initially proposed by the Attorney General came against the wishes of career staff, as they will need adequate time to perform this vital assessment. And, judging by AG Barr\u2019s dismissal of the staff recommendations, his race [4] to go after big tech appears to be politically motivated, which will almost certainly have negative implications for consumer protection. Regardless of what he ultimately decides, it is critical that we don\u2019t lose sight of the consumer welfare standard moving forward.<br/>To this end, the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee is holding a hearing [5] today on the Online Advertising Market, wherein Google will, once again, be specifically targeted. This hearing could be a worthwhile exploration of the state of advertising in the United States. For example, it could help to explore whether online advertising is a distinct market in which a platform can exert monopoly power and whether Google illegally maintains a monopoly said market. These are important questions for regulators to consider and we should continue to engage in the rigorous analysis of markets and competition to ensure that consumers are protected.<br/>But, if past hearings [6] on big tech are any indication, it could also quickly devolve into another useless \u201cbig is bad\u201d circus. This not only does nothing to get at the heart of any legitimate issues, but it sometimes also has had the unintended effect of demonstrating how little legislators actually know about technology.<br/>Above all else, AG Barr\u2019s move should remind us that politics cannot drive competition policy in the United States because, while politicians may score points against a perceived political target, consumers\u2014and everyday Americans\u2014are the ones who will lose the game entirely. Large technology companies, like any other large companies, create significant efficiencies and provide many invaluable services to consumers in the process. In light of this, in holding their mere size against them, we do so at our own peril.<br/>Endnotes<br/>\u201creports\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html</url><br/>\u201csuccessfully\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/why-facebook-plunked-down-1-billion-to-buy-instagram/\">https://www.cnet.com/news/why-facebook-plunked-down-1-billion-to-buy-instagram/</url><br/>\u201chome delivery of groceries\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2019/06/25/how-amazon-changed-whole-foods/#4c8f833878dd\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2019/06/25/how-amazon-changed-whole-foods/#4c8f833878dd</url><br/>\u201crace\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/23/justice-department-announces-antitrust-review-big-tech-threatening-facebook-google-with-more-scrutiny/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/23/justice-department-announces-antitrust-review-big-tech-threatening-facebook-google-with-more-scrutiny/</url><br/>\u201chearing\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&amp;id;=47090D09-17CE-40F6-AEAF-DB16847D7F98\">https://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&amp;id;=47090D09-17CE-40F6-AEAF-DB16847D7F98</url><br/>\u201cpast hearings\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/antitrust-big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-google-facebook.html\">https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/antitrust-big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-google-facebook.html</url><br/>The post Is Big So Bad?

The Article 65 process has been triggered because an unspecified number of other supervisory authorities have raised objections (as they are entitled to) to the draft decision of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) - the lead supervisory authority - in its investigation of whether Twitter complied with its personal data breach obligations under Article 33 of GDPR, in relation to a notification it made to the DPC in November 2018. In line with Articles 56 and 60, the DPC submitted its draft decision to other EU supervisory authorities in May of this year. As this was a case involving cross-border processing, the DPC was required to cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned. Given that the complaint concerned Twitter, we assume the supervisory authorities of all member states were consulted. It also seems likely that most complaints involving Big Tech (many of whom tend to base their European operations in Ireland, thus making the DPC the default lead supervisory authority) will similarly engage the supervisory authorities of all member states. The DPC already has many such complaint investigations, and, courtesy of civil society groups like 'NOYB', it is likely to continue to get many more.</p><p>Article 65 provides that where another supervisory authority 'has raised a relevant and reasoned objection' to a draft decision of the lead supervisory authority, and the latter then doesn't agree, then the EDPB must step in to consider the objection. The EDPB then has one month (two if the subject matter is complex) to reach a two-thirds majority decision, or, failing that, within a further two weeks, to reach a simple majority decision. The decision is binding on all the supervisory authorities.</p><p>This appears to mean that, in circumstances where the EDPB agrees with an objection, then the lead supervisory authority will be bound to accept a decision it probably still does not agree with, and determine the substantive matter accordingly. In the context of the DPC, and its jurisdiction over the European processing of many of the world's largest technology companies, this could have an interesting outcome: there are many supervisory authorities on the EDPB who take a substantially harder line than the DPC - if they end up being part of a simple majority which results in a 'robust' binding decision adverse to the technology companies, then further challenges may almost certainly result.</p><p>The controller being investigated appears to be able to challenge the EDPB's decision by way of an action for annulment under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union. There is no direct route of appeal under the GDPR. But presumably an aggrieved controller may also potentially challenge the lead supervisory authority's decision (which, remember, the latter might essentially disagree with) through the domestic courts, perhaps to the point where a referral to the CJEU could then also be made.</p><p>It has taken seven years, and counting, for complaints raised with the DPC, about transfers of data by Facebook to the US, to wend their way through the CJEU process. There may be years of similar challenges to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMFNNW-IFN5762810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMFNNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R4-M0J1-F0YC-N4T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact Financial News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56566\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The report is actually quite positive about Big Tech entry into financial services, as it can reach the parts of the system previously unreachable, banking the unbanked and underbanked. However, it does call for policy regulators to create a level playing field between banks and Big Tech and, bearing in mind that the average bank deals with five times more regulatory oversight than the average technology firm, that means a lot more Big Tech regulation. </p><p>The full report can be found here[2], with the key takeaways being: The entry of large technology firms ('big techs') into financial services holds the promise of efficiency gains and can enhance financial inclusion. Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big techs' wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models. Big techs' entry presents new and complex trade-offs between financial stability, competition and data protection. The introduction of the report begins: Technology firms such as Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Tencent have grown rapidly over the last two decades. The business model of these 'big techs' rests on enabling direct interactions among a large number of users. An essential by-product of their business is the large stock of user data which are utilised as input to offer a range of services that exploit natural network effects, generating further user activity. Increased user activity then completes the circle, as it generates yet more data. Building on the advantages of the reinforcing nature of the data-network-activities loop, some big techs have ventured into financial services, including payments, money management, insurance and lending. As yet, financial services are only a small part of their business globally. But given their size and customer reach, big techs' entry into finance has the potential to spark rapid change in the industry. It offers many potential benefits. Big techs' low-cost structure business can easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services, especially in places where a large part of the population remains unbanked. Using big data and analysis of the network structure in their established platforms, big techs can assess the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the need for collateral to assure repayment. As such, big techs stand to enhance the efficiency of financial services provision, promote financial inclusion and allow associated gains in economic activity. At the same time, big techs' entry into finance introduces new elements in the risk-benefit balance. Some are old issues of financial stability and consumer protection in new settings. In some settings, such as the payment system, big techs have the potential to loom large very quickly as systemically relevant financial institutions. Given the importance of the financial system as an essential public infrastructure, the activities of big techs are a matter of broader public interest that goes beyond the immediate circle of their users and stakeholders. There are also important new and unfamiliar challenges that extend beyond the realm of financial regulation as traditionally conceived. Big techs have the potential to become dominant through the advantages afforded by the data-network-activities loop, raising competition and data privacy issues. Public policy needs to build on a more comprehensive approach that draws on financial regulation, competition policy and data privacy regulation. The aim should be to respond to big techs' entry into financial services so as to benefit from the gains while limiting the risks. As the operations of big techs straddle regulatory perimeters and geographical borders, coordination among authorities - national and international - is crucial. And ends with a call to change how firms are regulated. Traditionally, financial regulation is aimed at ensuring the solvency of individual financial institutions and the soundness of the financial system as a whole. It also incorporates consumer protection goals. The policy instruments used to achieve these goals are well understood, ranging from capital and liquidity requirements in the case of banks to the regulation of conduct for consumer protection. When big techs' activity falls squarely within the scope of traditional financial regulation, the same principles should apply to them. However, two additional features make the formulation of the policy response more challenging for big techs. First, big techs' activity in finance may warrant a more comprehensive approach that encompasses not only financial regulation but also competition and data privacy objectives. Second, even when the policy goals are well articulated, the specific policy tools should actually be shown to promote those objectives. This link between ends and means should not be taken for granted. This is because the mapping between policy tools and the ultimate welfare outcomes is more complex in the case of big techs. In particular, the policy tools that are aimed at traditional financial regulation objectives may also impinge on competition and data privacy objectives, and vice versa. These interactions introduce potentially complex trade-offs that do not figure in traditional financial regulation.

Soon enough, technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), could remake health care, energy, transportation, agriculture, the public sector, the natural environment, and even our minds and bodies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Applying science to social problems has brought huge dividends in the past. Long before the invention of the silicon chip, medical and technological innovations had already made our lives far more comfortable - and longer. But history is also replete with disasters caused by the power of science and the zeal to improve the human condition.</p><p>For example, efforts to boost agricultural yields through scientific or technological augmentation in the context of collectivization in the Soviet Union or Tanzania backfired spectacularly. Sometimes, plans to remake cities through modern urban planning all but destroyed them. The political scientist James Scott has dubbed such efforts to transform others' lives through science instances of \"high modernism.\"</p><p>An ideology as dangerous as it is dogmatically overconfident, high modernism refuses to recognize that many human practices and behaviors have an inherent logic that is adapted to the complex environment in which they have evolved. When high modernists dismiss such practices in order to institute a more scientific and rational approach, they almost always fail.</p><p>Historically, high-modernist schemes have been most damaging in the hands of an authoritarian state seeking to transform a prostrate, weak society. In the case of Soviet collectivization, state authoritarianism originated from the self-proclaimed \"leading role\" of the Communist Party. Yet authoritarianism is not solely the preserve of states. It can also originate from any claim to unbridled superior knowledge or ability. Consider contemporary efforts by corporations, entrepreneurs, and others who want to improve our world through digital technologies. Recent innovations have vastly increased productivity in manufacturing, improved communication, and enriched the lives of billions of people. But they could easily devolve into a high-modernist fiasco.</p><p>Frontier technologies such as AI, Big Data, and IoT are often presented as panaceas for optimizing work, recreation, communication, and health care. The conceit is that we have little to learn from ordinary people and the adaptations they have developed within different social contexts.</p><p>The problem is that an unconditional belief that \"AI can do everything better,\" to take one example, creates a power imbalance between those developing AI technologies and those whose lives will be transformed by them. The rich and variegated patterns of communication that exist off-line have been replaced by scripted, standardized, and limited modes of communication on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. As a result, the nuances of face-to-face communication, and of news mediated by trusted outlets, have been obliterated. Efforts to \"connect the world\" with technology have created a morass of propaganda, disinformation, hate speech, and bullying.</p><p>But this characteristically high-modernist path is not preordained. Instead of ignoring social context, those developing new technologies could actually learn something from the experiences and concerns of real people. The technologies themselves could be adaptive rather than hubristic, designed to empower society rather than silence it.</p><p>Two forces are likely to push new technologies in this direction. The first is the market, which may act as a barrier against misguided top-down schemes. That said, the power of the market constraint should not be exaggerated. There is no guarantee that the market will select the right technologies for widespread adoption, nor will it internalize the negative effects of some new applications. The fact that Facebook exists and collects information about its 2.5 billion active users in a market environment does not mean we can trust how it will use that data.</p><p>Democratic politics often drives the demand for such regulation. It is also the best defense against the capture of state policies by rent-seeking businesses attempting to raise their market shares or profits.</p><p>Democracy also provides the best mechanism for airing diverse viewpoints and organizing resistance to costly or dangerous high-modernist schemes. But regular elections are not sufficient to prevent Big Tech from creating a high-modernist nightmare. Insofar as new technologies can thwart free speech and political compromise and deepen concentrations of power in government or the private sector, they can frustrate the workings of democratic politics itself, creating a vicious circle. If the tech world chooses the high-modernist path, it may ultimately damage our only reliable defense against its hubris: democratic oversight of how new technologies are developed and deployed. We as consumers, workers, and citizens should all be more cognizant of the threat, for we are the only ones who can stop it.</p><p>- Project Syndicate</p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-151283451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSD-R7S1-JDJN-64T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

The discussion is ablaze about whether big tech is out of control and needs to be tamed.</p><p>Prominent economist Kenneth Rogoff goes as far as to suggest that the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/how-americas-corporate-giants-are-hurting-the-economy-20170813-gxvgqx\">tech firms are hurting competition in the economy</url> because of their oligopoly-like power.</p><p>\"They're anti-innovation,\" he says. \"Any little innovative company, they buy it up.\"</p><p>In Rogoff's mind this ability to take over any emerging competitive threat interferes with the creative destruction of capitalism. Even media mogul <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/business/fang-forces-rupert-murdochs-21st-century-fox-sale-talk-20171109-gzihus\">Rupert Murdoch sold the bulk of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets</url> because of the competitive threat from Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Google in streaming content to viewers.</p><p>The dilemma is that the world appears to have experienced similar phenomena in the past.</p><p>The coveted front page of Forbes magazine a decade ago featured an image of Nokia chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo using one of the Finnish company's flip phones.</p><p>\"Nokia. One billion customers - can anyone catch the cell phone king?\" posed the headline.</p><p>History shows the Nokia mobile phone was eclipsed by Apple's iPhone very soon after that question was posed.</p><p>Nokia's share price today is about ???4, crashing from a peak of ???63 in 2000.</p><p>In the 1980s and '90s the US government wanted to regulate IBM and Microsoft as monopolies, just as a new breed of technology disrupters were emerging to take their crowns.</p><p>Industrialist \"robber barons\" of the late 19th century, such as railway operators, oil barons including the Rockefellers and Wall Street financiers had outsized influence on the economy, policy and politics.</p><p>Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, says regulators need to be careful they don't prematurely intervene in the market.</p><p>\"Facebook's and Google's dominance is not going to be sustainable over a longer period of time,\" he says.</p><p>The problem for big tech is that regulators and politicians are not inclined to stand still and let the market come to a solution.</p><p>Which brings us to the question many are asking: Could this time be different because the big tech firms control so much valuable data on their users - pretty much everyone - that the barriers to entry for competitors are much higher than in the past?</p><p>The drumbeats for intervention are growing, both from politicians in Washington and those representing old business models hurt by Silicon Valley disruption.</p><p>\"You don't get to be a major, major global success without hurting competitors,\" says Rob Atkinson, president of the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank.</p><p>\"The people hurt by that support the narrative and cast aspersions on them to get a commercial leg up on lobbying positions in Washington.\"</p><p>Indeed, Murdoch's News Corporation publications, including The Australian and The Wall Street Journal, have given front page space to the failures of big tech.</p><p>Google and Facebook have sucked away millions in advertising revenue from News and Fairfax Media, publisher of AFR Weekend.</p><p>Their data and algorithms are so precise in targeting consumers, that Google and Facebook collect about 84 per cent of international digital advertising revenue, media buying agency GroupM estimates.</p><p>Belatedly perhaps, big tech has seen the writing on the wall and is trying to spruce up its image to keep heavy-handed regulators at bay.</p><p>Facebook is tweaking its controversial international tax structure by announcing it will no longer book some digital advertising sales through its low-tax Irish subsidiary.</p><p>Google is entering into <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/publishing/fairfax-media-and-google-partner-on-advertising-and-technology-20171211-h02ge2\">revenue-sharing and data-sharing agreements with traditional media</url> publishers, such as Fairfax, News Corp, the Financial Times and The New York Times. In theory such deals should direct more advertising, and as a result more ad dollars, to these publishers.</p><p>Facebook is setting up new transparency tools to check who is really behind advertisements, in response to the outcry about Russia manipulating the social media platform to boost Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton during the election.</p><p>It's a vastly different attitude to 12 months ago when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg brushed off criticisms by arguing it was a \"pretty crazy idea\" that the social media network was used to influence the election.</p><p>The ITIF's Atkinson says tech companies should have done a better job earlier to take preventive steps.</p><p>\"If they don't fix the problem, they're in big, big trouble.\"</p><p>But he foresees a new emerging backlash against tech disrupters that may unite blue and white collar workers alike against big tech: the automation of jobs.</p><p>\"Automation and jobs is going to continue to challenge the tech industry,\" Atkinson says. \"They're really disruptive and I don't think the industry had done a good job of pushing back against these narratives.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1028127326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R89-XBB1-JBJ7-N2XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><timeReceived>06:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
