In the opinion of \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00edn, an economist specialized in financial regulation at BBVA, \"greater competition is good, but there has to be a point where you have to rebalance to avoid unfair advantages,\" he said during his participation in the debate. <br/><br/><br/><br/> A similar analysis was presented by Gloria Herv\u00e1s, manager of Public Policy in Santander, for whom the regulatory pendulum went too far in terms of opening up to new competitors, forcing only banks to open their data to third parties. \"We must explore the convenience of the data of other companies can be transmitted to third parties, always with consent,\" he proposed. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Herv\u00e1s opted to \"deconsolidate\" part of the most innovative activities within the banking and fintech sectors, so that they stand apart from the high costs involved in banking regulation. \"Maybe we should think about businesses that are outside of this strict banking supervision,\" he said. <br/><br/><br/><br/> \"The regulators have the challenge of maintaining a balanced playing field while preserving the safety and entry of new competitors,\" said Xavier Vives, professor of Economics and Finance at the IESE business school and independent director of CaixaBank. <br/><br/> Competition for the most profitable activities <br/><br/> Precisely to analyze the challenge that banking poses for the competition of giants like Google, Amazon or Facebook, the meeting organized by the AEB in Cunef presented the study Big tech banking, signed by Miguel de la Mano and Jorge Padilla, of the specialized consultancy on competition issues Compass Lexecon. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The authors of the study consider that, \"initially\", the entrance of the great technology companies in the banking sector can have a positive impact in terms of greater competition. However, they warn that in the long term banks are exposed to an existential challenge, which could lead to risks for financial stability. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The origin of these risks would be, as these two analysts point out, in the very essence of the business of these bigtech giants and their \"envelopment\" business strategy, already proven in multiple sectors. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Thus, the big technology companies like Google or Amazon enter to compete (with almost assured success due to their out-of-market prices) in those more profitable segments of activity,as the origination or distribution of loans. Other activities with more regulatory costs or less profitable, such as deposit capturing, would, on the other hand, be outside the aspirations of these global companies. <br/><br/><br/><br/> If this dynamic of entry into the banking market ends up reproducing (as it has already happened in other sectors), financial entities will progressively reduce their weight in the economy, in favor of these giants. This could result, according to the authors of this study, in banking markets that are even more concentrated than at present, \"so new and greater moral risks and problems of adverse selection could threaten financial stability,\" they warn. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The solution proposed by Padilla and De la Mano is to limit the ability of these large corporations to control the data of millions of users exclusively. Thus, they bet because the regulators oblige to share this data: \"Platforms from a certain size will have to guarantee access to others, including traditional banks, of transactional data, including personal data, from the consent of the clients. \", They point out in the conclusions of the document presented. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-5129342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWX-5CN1-JCMP-531B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 6, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002OTO</classCode><className>BANCO SANTANDER SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Closing bell ringing on  Wall Street.  Dow Jones at a record again, of .2 of 1 percent.  Nasdaq also  at a record high.  We'll bring you that in the trading post.  Otherwise,  sir, do the honors.  I declare that to be a firm gavel on Wednesday,  October the 11th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Walking away from Catalonia the president tells CNN, he want talks with  Madrid, as businesses are abandoning the Spanish region.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Walking away from NAFTA, President Trump is threatening to leave the deal,  as a new round of negotiations begin, the President's been meeting the  Canadian Prime Minister.  </p><p>And walking away from Weinstein.  The film company's partners consider  cancelling their various deals.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where, of course, I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  Tonight, five days that will decide the future of Catalonia  and indeed the cohesion of Spain.  The country's Prime Minister Mariano  Rajoy has given the Catalonian president until Monday to clarify if he's  declared independence or not.  With the IMF already warning contagion, his  answers whether this crisis is settled by dialogue or something more  dramatic.  </p><p>Both sides are now playing the waiting game.  Let me show you exactly how  this plays out.  If you take Spain, Madrid in the center, Barcelona on the  eastern coast.  Madrid and Catalonia are retreating behind their respective  red lines, a negotiating strategy.  And they're waiting to see if either of  the other side crosses the red line.  </p><p>So, let's take the Madrid side first.  If you look at Madrid, the Prime  Minister Rajoy has refused to hold talks unless the independence claim is  dropped.  And he's warning that Catalonia will do great damage to itself  and to business if it goes ahead with its independence.  Today he said the  crisis has already done more to hurt Catalan tourism than terror attacks in  Barcelona.  It's significantly -- Mariano Rajoy, the Prime Minister,  bearing in mind what the Catalan President did yesterday, the prime  minister says the next move is up to Catalonia.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIANO RAJOY, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  It is the  answer that Mr. Puigdemont will give to this issue that will mark the  future of what's going to happen next.  It is within his power to go back  to legality, and to institutional normality or to continue with an  instability period without perhaps losing Catalonia.  We are living one of  the worst moments in the recent history of democracy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Now, in his back pocket the prime minister always has the nuclear  option of Article 155 of, the Spanish constitution that would allow him to  basically impose direct rule once again on Catalonia.  If he were to do  that, well, on the other side, you have the red line from the Catalan  President, who is insisting on talks without preconditions.  Catalonia's  economy does give him some leverage.  It makes up about 20 percent of  Spanish GDP and pays much more into the tax system of Madrid and Spain than  it does get back from the country.  In an exclusive interview with CNN, the  Catalan President said it was time for proper talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLES PUIGDEMONT, CATALAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I believe that  today we find ourselves in a moment of most importance.  That we have no  prior conditions to sit down and talk.  Except that we must dialogue, and  we must dialogue within adequate conditions.  Maybe it could help dialogue  if two people from the Catalan government and two people from the Spanish  government simply agreed on one simple thing.  Appointing a mediator, for  instance.  But we cannot ignore the fact that talks apathetical discussions  need to come from recognizing reality.  </p><p>And that is what we need to talk about.  The relationship Catalonia, Spain,  it does not work and there is majority of Catalan people that want to make  Catalonia an independent state.  And want to do that in agreement with the  Spanish state.  But we need to do that without conditions.  We need to sit  down and really talk.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] QUEST:  Spanish investors are treating this entire incident with  a certain amount of trepidation and caution.  Let's just take today.  The  evidence for this is the way Spanish stocks rebound, from Tuesday's losses,  and outperformed the rest of Europe.  But really, at 1.3 percent gain in  the IBEX has to be seen the fall of the previous day, and almost certain  knowledge that if there was to be detrimental move tomorrow, that market  would turn down.  The cost of buying Spanish debt, which rises bond to its  lowest level of the month so far.  Again, the ten-year bond, this would  have to be seen in the context of an independence declaration or a  worsening situation that would send the bond higher, almost certainly.   Atika Shubert is live for us in Barcelona tonight.  This level of  uncertainty, Atika, these five days that the Prime Minister has given the  Catalonia President.  It's very tense.  </p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  absolutely.  I  mean, he's really turning the screws on Catalan President Puigdemont.  I  mean basically by asking him to clarify whether or not it was a declaration  of independence.  He's really trying to split, as well, the independence  movement.  Remember, it is fractured parliament here and Puigdemont is  really sitting on a coalition of many different interests.  </p><p>If he says for example, that no, it was only a symbolic declaration, then  he could find that he doesn't have the support from those much more  hardline separatists.  If he says, you know -- if he says it is declaration  of independence, well, that would be upping the stakes dramatically, a give  Rajoy a reason -- the Prime Minister a reason to come in and take over the  regional government.  So, he is really turning the screws on the Catalan  President.  How he's going to respond in the next few days is what we're  watching for.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  The idea of mediation, the idea of talks, would be what?   Talks about greater autonomy?  I mean, listening to that interview, with  Nic Robertson, where he talks about, you know, we have a right to  independence.  Well, even if you have temporary talks, talks to what?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  You know, the independence movement here goes back hundreds of  years really, it has deep historical roots.  But the most recent change  here happened in 2006, when there was autonomy statute that Catalan had  passed, and that was accepted by the Spanish government.  Then in 2010, the  constitutional, court struck that down.  And ever since independence then  the independence movement has been re-sparked.  It was basically revived  under that.  </p><p>So, if there were any talks to take place, it would be about this autonomy  statute.  What kind of an autonomy would Catalonia need?  What more would  they need?  Financial independence.  What else do they want?  And so, I  think that's what the talks in itself would be about.  But, you know, these  -- this idea that there will be no preconditions is something that the  Prime Minister says is absolutely a no go.  He Will not have any dialogue,  he says, until it's clear that there has not been a declaration of  independence.  </p><p>QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Barcelona.  Atika, thank you.  Let's talk to  Professor Luis Cabral of the International Business, NYU Stern.  Good to  see you Professor.  </p><p>LUIS CABRAL, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, NYU STERN:  Good to see  you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Where is the pressure coming from here?  There's the political  pressure in one since, but how significant is the business pressure?   Whether it's the Caixa Bank moving out, the other banks, the other  companies taking advantage.  Where does commerce come into it?  </p><p>CABRAL:  The biggest pressure is the large banks and large corporations  that are headquartered in Barcelona, and that are thinking very seriously  about moving to Madrid.  Because if there is independence or even if there  is a situation of uncertainty continues the way it is now, it's not good  business to be in Barcelona for them.  And that can have a huge negative  impact on the Catalonia economy.  In fact, that's already been happening  for a number of years, by the way, because of the language laws in  Catalonia.  So, this would only accelerate that movement.  </p><p>QUEST:  One assumes that the Catalonian government does not wish to commit  financial suicide, or at least economic suicide.  Now, similar arguments  with Scotland.  If they vote for independence, they leave the European  Union.  </p><p>CABRAL:  That's true.  And as of now, it's not clear what would happen to  Catalonia if there were to become independent.  You would need all of the  European Union countries to vote in favor of them becoming members of the  European Union.  And it's far from obvious that would be the case.  </p><p>QUEST:  Well, Spain certainly wouldn't and the United Kingdom wouldn't.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Probably not.  </p><p>QUEST:  Assuming the U.K. is still there, of course.</p><p>CABRAL:  That is correct.  And so, that's part of the potential cost of  independence.  Now, of course, it's not very credible to say that we will  never talk to you again.  And I think some sort of a deal agreement,  possibly even membership, would eventually be achieved, in my opinion.  </p><p>[16:10:00] QUEST:  But what do they want -- I mean, you heard me ask Atika  Shubert this.  When Catalonia suspends its declaration of independence, and  there's more talks or mediation, the two are diametrically opposed.  The  Prime Minister cannot give ground -- he said this tonight.  You know,  you've got five days to make it clear that you're not declaring  independence.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Yes.  I'm not sure that they were expecting Rajoy to be as strict  and strong as he's Ben right now.  Perhaps what they were thinking about --  who knows what they were thinking about.  It is perhaps they could  renegotiate the independent -- the autonomy statute and the shadow of  possible independence.  And they're just realizing that doesn't work.   That's not working.  At least Rajoy is playing hardball, and it seems to me  that Catalonia is going to lose this battle.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  And just to brief us -- for those who doesn't follow this  as closely as yourself -- the Spanish opposition at the national level is  also in favor of the Rajoy position.  I mean, they may not want such a  hardline position but Rajoy is speaking largely for the entire Spanish body  politic.  </p><p>CABRAL:  That is correct.  And for a significant fraction of Catalonia.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do we actually know?  </p><p>CABRAL:  We don't have the exact numbers my idea is that it's probably  split down the middle, very close to 50/50.  </p><p>QUEST:  Which is a very dangerous area to go into some call for  independence, claiming you have a mandate when 50 percent of the people  actually don't want anything to do with it.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Exactly.  So, there is a majority of people a referendum voted in  favor of independence.  But the turnout was quite low.  And so, there's  probably about 50 percent of Catalonians who are against independence.  At  least in the way that's being prosed right now.  And so, it's a difficult - - and the president -- the leader of Catalonia, in my opinion, is between a  rock and a hard place, because the more extremist Catalonians are pushing  very hard for independence.  But on the other hand, it just realized it  would be tough for him if he were to go ahead with independence right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, professor.  Thank you very much indeed.  Much  appreciated.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Spain's economy minister will be joining me live on tomorrow night's  program.  Luis de Guindos will be with us at the annual meeting of the lMF  in Washington.  You can see that interview, as well as my debate on the  global economy with the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde.  It is  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tomorrow at this time, live from Washington.  </p><p>So, we need too immediately to our new trading post, and all three -- let  me find -- here we go.  All three of the markets have closed at record.   That means it's the 48th record of the year for the Dow.  The 44th for the  S&amp;P.  And crucially, it is the 56th for the Nasdaq.  One of the reasons --  not only just the news generally -- but one of the reasons for these three  records, the Fed minutes said that there needed to be some patience with  raising rates.  The minutes just came out.  </p><p>Delta Airlines despite the incidents of hurricanes and other delays, Delta  Airlines had earnings better than expected.  So, put this together, and  you've got records on the Dow over 20 -- I mean, 23,000 is looking  extremely touchable and within grasp on the S&amp;P 500 and on the Nasdaq.   You've got nearly 50 records on the Dow.  And no wonder Donald Trump, the  president, has described the market movements as unprecedented.  And the  signs of fear in the market at the moment, absolutely nothing there.  But  remain at 84 on the CNN Money fear and greed index, which is one of extreme  greed.  As you can see, green just about all around the set as we have got  Paul La Monica.  All three are records.  And not just that, good records.   The momentum is there.  There're not eking out these records.  They seem to  want to head there.  </p><p>PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, these are solid gains.   And I think we've talked about this on the show.  Pretty much since the  beginning of the year.  I think a lot of it, despite the President taking  credit for it, is in spite of what's going on in Washington.  Corporate  earnings have been good.  You noted Delta.  We had Blackrock reporting some  good results.  And hopefully Will get decent ones from the big thanks later  this week.  But consumers still spending, corporations still spending.  I'm  just not so sure this is about politics, because, again, as my colleague  Matt Eagan pointed out, we had a lot of records under President Obama, too.   It's not a unique phenomenon -- </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, but 48 in a year.  It's not a -- I mean, we'll need to find  out.  Maybe you could get CNNMoney to see if this is a record so far in  terms of number of records </p><p>LA MONICA:  A record of records.  </p><p>QUEST:  A record of records.  Thank you.  A record of records.  The IMF  meets.  They've warmed about inequality.  </p><p>[16:15:00] Schauble has warned about bubbles and imbalances that exist out  there, as a result of liquidity.  The Fed today suggesting that patience  might be required from the September meeting.  Does that put off a rate  rise to next year?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I doubt it.  I think that the Fed will probably try and sneak  in one more rate hike in December, as long as earnings remain pretty strong  and the market is doing well.  And, of course, they're looking at  inflation, which is starting to creep up a little bit, because of wage  growth.  We had a very nice jobs report last week with regards to what the  wage growth number was, even though we lost jobs last month.  We did get  nearly 3 percentage wage growth.  And the Fed, I think, is watching that  very closely.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, Coach has become tapestry.  And we think that it might have  something to do with this.  Have a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAROL KING, SONGWRITER, RECORDING ARTIST:  Now my tapestry is unraveling. He's come to take me back.   He's come to take me back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Carol King.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, very, very nice.  Very well-played.  I seriously doubt  that that was the motivation.  I did speak to someone at Coach.  As they  now -- they now call it --</p><p>QUEST:  Don't ruin the day.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  -- they now call it tapestry -- they did acknowledge -- it's a  bit of a cutesy name that plays off the whole notion of weaving several  brands into one.  Putting that all aside, this is really similar to what we  had with Alphabet and Google.  There is nothing that people go to that is  Alphabet per se.  You still go to Google.  You go to YouTube.  In the same  way here with Coach, the Coach brand name -- if you like to buy handbag and  wallets from Coach, it's still going to be called Coach.  They're still  going to have Kate Spade, and Sarah Wiseman, the other two brand they  recently acquired.  And I think that's what this signals.  Maybe Coach  wants to do another deal.  And having an umbrella sort of name to house all  of these different brands, that seems to what they're looking to do.  </p><p>QUEST:  I seem to have left my wallet.  Could you lend m, a bit of money --  Paul thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Extraordinary.  More developments as show business -- the world of  show business turns against Harvey Weinstein.  And the allegations are  piling up.  Now the Manhattan District Attorney is defending his decision  not to charge Weinstein with sex crimes.  You're going to hear from him  next.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Straight to Washington, where the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin  Trudeau, is speaking to reporters after meeting with the U.S. President.  </p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  We know that the success of any  society depends on the full socioeconomic participation of women, because  women succeed, we all succeed.  And whether it's flexible hours, parental  leave, affordable child care, diversity training, equal pay, or any other  number of initiatives.  It's incumbent of us across the public and private  spheres to be proud agents for change.  </p><p>[16:20:08] Following that theme, this morning I had a productive round  table with WomenOne, where we discussed the current barriers to global  gender equality and marked the international day of the girl.  I also met  with the committee on ways and means, and we had a great conversation about  the importance of the Canada/U.S. partnership.  And I just wrapped up a  very good meeting with President Trump, where we talked about trade,  security and economic growth.  As we know, the fourth round of NAFTA  negotiations is under way here in Washington.  And the President and I  reiterated our commitment to in good tired faith to give this deal a much- needed upgrade.  NAFTA has benefited millions of people and can benefit  millions more.  We're pleased to have the opportunity to modernize this  trade agreement for the current economy, a modernization that acknowledges  the importance of gender, the environment and indigenous and labor rights.  </p><p>We know that there are millions of jobs on both sides of the Canada/U.S.  border that rely on trade and investment.  In fact, Canada is among the top  export markets for the majority of U.S. states.  And so, it's imperative  that we get a fair deal for Canadians, Americans and Mexicans alike.   That's what our teams at all orders of government are working hard towards.  </p><p>QUEST:  Justin Trudeau, talking there on NAFTA.  He describes NAFTA as an  upgrade to NAFTA, to modernize it.  We'll get more details on that in the  hours ahead.  Also talking about women and the whole gender question.   Harvey Weinstein comes into all of this, of course.  Harvey Weinstein, the  Hollywood producer, is on his way to rehab.  His wife of ten years has left  him.  The company -- the Weinstein Company is facing an uncertain future.   The claims of sexual misconduct just keep coming.  More women are accusing  the Hollywood producer of rape.  We must stress, Harvey Weinstein denies  those claims.  The indications are the allegations haven't finished.   Amazon is reviewing its projects with the Weinstein Company.  This week his  name was removed from the credits of its shows like \"Project Runway.\"  The  Weinstein Company board has expressed shock and dismay at new allegations  of extreme sexual misconduct and assault.</p><p>An earlier than Manhattan District Attorney explained his decision not to  press charges in the past.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CY VANCE, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  I understand that folks -- folks  are outraged by his behavior.  I understand that there are many other  allegations that have surfaced, but I our case, we really did what I think  the law obligates us to do.  Focus on the evidence and the facts that we  have.  and then I relied on the true professionals to help guide to the  decision, which is not always going to be the popular decision.  That's the  nature of being a prosecutor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  In the past few minutes, the Academy of Motion Picture and Arts --  basically the Oscars -- say they will hold a special meeting on Saturday  about the Weinstein allegations.  We have Erin Gloria Ryan is here.  Senior  editor for \"The Daily Beast\" and a CNN contributor.  In an op-ed for \"The  Daily Beast\" she defended victims who are reluctant to come forward.  It's  not surprising they're reluctant to come forward, is it?  They are promised  anonymity, or they are promised safe harbor, but the reality is most of  them know that until it becomes a cause celeb like this, they could be  alone, and they could be victimized.  </p><p>ERIN GLORIA RYAN, SENIOR EDITOR, THE DAILY BEAST:  Right.  I think any time  you're a woman who comes forward with this sort of allegation, you've got  someone as powerful as Harvey Weinstein, you're basically setting off an  atomic bomb with yourself at the center -- which I wrote in the piece for  \"The Daily Beast.\"  It's so risky, and it's so unlikely that you're going  to come out of it unscathed by your own career.  </p><p>QUEST:  What is the answer in that situation?  Because you're talking about  a real politic situation, where an individual goes up against a famous or  powerful person.  How does a company adapt then to allow for that?</p><p>RYAN:  I think that brings up a very interesting point.  Because Weinstein  couldn't have done this without all the people that were enabling him along  the way.  There were people who were more powerful than the actresses he is  he was allegedly victimizing who knew about this.  Who didn't say anything.   There were ostensibly film executives who heard about this who didn't do  anything.  There's an entertainment press that in their thirst for access  was willing two just, you know, just push their morals aside in order to  keep these buried.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you think people knew how bad it was or how egregious it was?  </p><p>RYAN:  I don't want to speculate on whether everybody knew every detail of  it.  I think this is the first time we've seen all these, kind of stomach- churning details in one place.  I think the fact that people had indicators  that there might be something that bad there and didn't speak up is pretty  damning to the culture of entertainment as a whole.  </p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST:  But are we in danger -- and I'm choosing my words  carefully and I'm treading delicately.  Are we in danger of turning Harvey  Weinstein into the devil incarnate with all the coverage, and everybody  heaping more opprobrium on top of him?  When the real story is not  Weinstein per se.  It is how it was able to perpetuate.  </p><p>RYAN:  I think it definitely is that.  I think it's also the way that this  -- this isn't just him.  And this isn't just this industry.  When I was  listening to that tape yesterday, there's a tape that the New York Police  Department got in a sting in 2015.  I was listening to that yesterday.   He's trying to coerce a woman into his hotel room.  I related to that tape  so much.  Not because Weinstein ever targeted me.  But because me and every  single woman I know has had a man try to treat us that way in our lives.  </p><p>It's something endemic to American culture.  It's something that's endemic  to different industries.  Media, tech, trucking, service.  This is a  conversation we should be having nationally.  It should be not just about  Weinstein.  Because getting him out of there is not going to fix the  problem.  But we should be doing is teaching men about consent.  And what  we should be doing is teaching men in a position to stand up they need to.  </p><p>QUEST:  So let me ask you, and I ask this as somebody who's got three  sisters and been around this issue most of me adult life -- most of my  life.  What then does need to be done.  To happen, to have that  conversation, to make them?  Because these allegations, in some shape or  form, sexual harassment has been known about by men for a very long time.  </p><p>RYAN:  Yes.  I think that the important thing is for men to take a couple  minutes and be alone and silent with themselves today and consider whether  or not they've ever enabled this sort of behavior.  And how they can  personally not enable it in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Very grateful you came and talked to us.  Thank you so much indeed.  </p><p>We'll continue tonight.  NAFTA negotiations on round.  We just heard the  Canadian Prime Minister describe it as an upgrade to NAFTA.  The talks are  resuming, and Justin Trudeau turns on the charm at the White House.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  in a moment.  When the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning President  Trump's position on NAFTA is full of poison pills.  And we give Apple,  Google, Amazon and Facebook, an all-access pass into our lives.  A  marketing professor says there is a reason for that.  </p><p>As we continue tonight this is CNN, and on this network, the news always  comes first.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is rejecting Catalonia's call for negotiating  independence from Spain, the prime minister has given the Catalan President  Carles Puigdemont until Monday to clarify whether his vision has declared independence or  not.</p><p>[16:30:00] If the answer is yes, and Puigdemont refuses to reconsider by  the following Thursday, Prime Minister Rajoy says Madrid could then impose  direct rule.</p><p>Firefighters in California are having a tough time, as they battle massive  fires, winds are expected to pick up in the area.  That could threaten to  spread the blaze.  So far, there's no rain in the forecast.  At least 21  people have been killed.  Hundreds more people are missing.  Early  estimates suggest property value damage is more than $65 billion.  </p><p>Multiple sources close to the White House tell CNN that President Trump is  expected to appoint Kirstjen Nielsen as the new U.S. Secretary of Homeland  Security.  The 45-year-old Nielsen would fill the vacancy left by John  Kelly who is now the chief of staff.  She currently works now as a deputy  to Kelly.</p><p>President Trump says he is stronger and tougher on North Korea than his  secretary of state.  Earlier Pyongyang's foreign minister says President  Trump in his words lit the wick of war in his speech at the United Nations  General Assembly.  Mr. Trump put North Korea's leader on notice in that  address, referring to Kim Jong-un as rocket man, in saying that the country  would not survive an American attack.</p><p>Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond says that although the U.K.  economy is fundamentally robust, Brexit is causing a cloud of certainty,  which needs to be cleared.  Hammond told lawmakers the U.K. should prepare  for the worst if no Brexit deal is reached with the E.U.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILIP HAMMOND, FINANCE MINISTER, GREAT BRITAIN:  We also have to consider  the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations, where we have  noncooperation.  Worst-case scenario, even a situation where people are not  necessarily acting in their own economic self-interest.  So, we need to  prepare for a wide range of scenarios.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  The top U.S. business lobby group is warning that NAFTA  negotiations are at risk of complete collapse as the latest round of talks  actually get underway.</p><p>The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau who you heard a moment ago was  at the White House meeting the president, who you heard, has repeatedly  threatened to leave NAFTA.  President Trump said whatever happens, a new  deal has to be fair to all sides.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's possible we won't be  able to make a deal, and it's possible that we will.  We have a great  personal relationship, and we have a relationship now is two countries that  is as close as ever.  But we will see if we can do the changes that we  need.  We have to protect our workers and in all fairness the prime  minister was to protect Canada and his people also/</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  On the eve of the talks that are about to start, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, chief executive Tom Donahue has criticized the Trump  administration for putting what it calls poison pill proposals into the  negotiations.  What are these poison pill various different things?  OK.  </p><p>Here you have, of course, the NAFTA area, Canada, the United States and  Mexico.  And the NAFTA negotiation in round 4, you can hear the poison  pills are rattling around the medicine cabinet.  The first one is the rules  of origin, determining how much of product must be manufactured in north  America to remain duty-free.  For example, the car industry, most at risk,  62 percent if the current rule.</p><p>Trump wants that to be higher and he wants within the rules of origin  specificity so that it's not just one country.  It specifies how much has  to come from the United States, which, of course, would defeat the whole  object of having the single market.  </p><p>Then you have a sunset clause, the U.S. wants NAFTA to expire every five  years until all three countries agree to whatever changes are necessary.   However, business says what's the point of having a NAFTA treaty if every  five years -- I mean let's face it, businesses are making 10, 15, 20-year  decisions, not five-year momentary decisions. So, they say that is not going to work.</p><p>And finally, dispute resolution.  U.S. wants to ditch the neutral  arbitration mechanism.  Put it all together, and you have poison pills that  could scupper, because the others will not agree.  The Mexicans and  Canadians will not agree to these fairly dramatic situations.  </p><p>At any rate to put this into perspective, Paula Newton who was up in Ottawa  with the Canadian position, Clare Sebastian is following the U.S. position.   We'll start with you, Paula, Ms.  Newton, because your prime minister is in  the United States at the moment.  Is Canada prepared for failure of these  talks in the same way that President Trump seemingly is?  </p><p>[16:35:00] PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, and I know  speaking to the Canadian officials behind the scenes that they do not put  it past the president to eventually, because he needs those campaign wins,  most political wins, Richard, to do what he says might do which is  terminate the deal.</p><p>But this is what the Canadians are doing.  Before that meeting with Trump,  Justin Trudeau was on Capitol Hill talking to a very powerful committee  there, the committee that is stacked with Republicans to know how important  Canada is in terms of a trading relationship for their states.  And they  are saying, look.  Number one, Canada is the U.S.'s largest customer, more  trade, the by more than the U.K., China, Japan combined.  In number two,  even if the president signs an executive order, ending NAFTA, it is  Congress that has the final say as to whether that happens.  There might be  some constitutional dispute about that.  We'll wait and see.  But right  now, Congress is saying, we do hold sway here.  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is because he's  renegotiating NAFTA at the moment, Richard.  Remember on the campaign trail  and in fact multiple times including this week President Trump has  threatened to rip the whole thing up just do away with it.  In that he can  do unilaterally.  It's called article 2205 and NAFTA, he's allowed to just  make that decision, that would trigger a six-month process where he could  rescind the decision during that six months but he can do it.</p><p>QUEST:  But Clare there is no movement as yet, seemingly they are  negotiating, but these poison pills are destined to scupper because they  are perceived to be not in good faith.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  Those of us with untrained eyes in the area of  trade deals, there is -- doesn't seem to be any way that the three sides  can agree on this.  Mexico is deeply alarmed by the whole rules of origin  thing the U.S. could apply one rule to themselves, one to something else.   Canada is alarmed of getting rid of dispute settlements.  </p><p>QUEST:  Pause there.  Stay with me, Paula.  Justin Trudeau is answering  questions.  Let's have a listen.</p><p>JUSTIN Trudeau, Prime Minister, Canada:  How good NAFTA has been for  millions of citizens of Canada, of the United States and indeed for Mexico.   I know there are opportunities to significantly improve these trade deals  in ways that will benefit citizens right across United States and Canada as  well</p><p>And I truly believe that we can work together in a meaningful way to bring  those benefits to our citizens.  Negotiations are difficult.  Unpredictable  at times but I truly believe that the presidents focused on creating  benefits for his citizens, for the middle class the way we are.  And that  positive trade deals, modernized trade deals, we will get that done.  So  that is something that I continue to focus on.  The conversations we've had  with the way and means committee, the conversations I've had with governors  across the country., the conversations I've had with various leaders of  industry have all emphasized that they see the direct benefits that NAFTA  has brought to their communities, to their economies, and can continue to  bring in the future.  so --</p><p>QUEST:  So, Paula Newton in Ottawa.  Does he believe that?  I mean, you  said to me he's preparing to leave.  Or, no, he's recognizing that that  could be an option.  Nuclear option.  </p><p>[16:40:00] NEWTON:  It is.  But it will be Donald Trump's to trigger or  their decision to walk away from the table.  They need to prepare for those  talks to break down.  You heard him now that isn't much different from what  he said from the last few months.  What is important is what happened in  the last couple hours.  He took the measure of the president and tried to  determine exactly how serious he is, not about terminating NAFTA, but how  serious he is about going back to those poison pills.  What determines a  win for Donald Trump?</p><p>And that's what the prime minister was trying to find out, and we'll know  in the next little while whether he got to that end, and will instruct his  negotiators accordingly.  </p><p>QUEST:  Paula and Clare, thank you.</p><p>Four giants of technology, and they have one goal.  In a moment, the inside  story to the race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Google has had to admit there is a bug in its new home mini  speaker.  Tech bloggers discovered the smart speaker secretly recorded just  about everything it hears Google issued a software update to turn off the  function.  The device expected to go on sale next week.  </p><p>As for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they seem to dominate headlines  and our very lives.  Take the last 48 hour for example.  This is a list of  headlines.  Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping.  Amazon  exploring ways to deliver items inside your home.  Zuckerberg apologizes  for Puerto Rico VR stunt.  </p><p>Apple strikes deal with Spielberg's Amblin.</p><p>As Professor Scott Galloway of marketing at NYU Stern, the author of, \"The  Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google.\"</p><p>Why are they so successful?  Is it because they have basically come up with  something that we find that we actually need?  Admittedly, we didn't know  about it before but that is because it had not been invented.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR, NYU STERN:  Yes, it runs deeper than  that, Richard.  Google is our modern man' god.  As we become wealthier,  more educated, we're less dependent on a super being, but still he huge  questions.  Used to pray to the gods, will my kid be all right.  Now  symptoms in treatment of croup typed into the Google query box.  When the  six questions have never been asked before that are presented to Google in  the history of mankind.  No coach, Rabbi, priest has that sort of  credibility, Google is our modern God.</p><p>Facebook taps into our need to love and love others through pictures that  reinforce relationships.  Amazon is our consumptive gut.  More for less is  always a strategy that works.  An Apple appeals to our reproductive organs,  Apple is a new symbol of wealth, power, innovation and says you have better  genes to potential mates.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, but at the end of the day, they are doing a good job, they are  doing what they say they will do.  You can't fault them.  And in this  digital age of the Internet economy, they are serving a purpose.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  They do a great job.  And I don't fault them.  I think the  question is, should we as a society ask questions around, do we no longer  worship at the altar of kindness and character but innovation and hold  these companies to different standard than we hold other companies?  </p><p>Your firm, this firm, wasn't weaponized by Russia.  You have checks and  balances in place that cost you a lot of money and reduce your bottom line.   Yet we have decided to Google and Facebook aren't subject to the same  responsibilities as other media companies.</p><p>QUEST:  Is the possibility on that point, on the weaponization, for  example, the weaponization of Facebook, which -- you're concerned about.  </p><p>[16:45:00] That really, it's happened much faster.  it may have taken 40  years for this company to have got size, heft and a certain amount of  influence and power.</p><p>But the speed with which these are, we haven't had time to put in place the  necessary safeguards.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  The technology and innovation has outpaced the public policy or  ability to realm with it.  A lot of people believe that Facebook is not  even sure they know what they fully have right now.</p><p>QUEST:  Let's look at the graphs of share prices which I now is not exactly  a barometer of anything other than people's wealth.  But if you look at,  say, for example, any of them, Apple, Amazon, Google -- here's Apple.   Facebook -- I beg your pardon.  Look at that.  Pretty much solid that  afterwards everybody said, oh lord, this has gone badly.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  So, the combined market capitalization of these four companies  is equivalent to the GDP of India.  Amazon which is paid 1.4 billion in  corporate income tax whereas Walmart has paid 64 billion since the great  recession, it Amazon has added the value of Walmart to its market in the  last 24 months.  We have never seen companies this powerful.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, if you accept, and you have at the beginning of this, that  they're serving a purpose, they're doing it extremely well.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  And there's a need or we've discovered a need for what they want.   Are you suggesting regulation to impose those forms of safeguards, checks  and balances that a Time Warner has?  Or are you looking at something like  antitrust, break them up?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  I'm suggesting we hold them to the same standards we hold other  companies and we begin to ask hard questions -- I think we suffer from a  gross idolatry of innovation and youth that has created two-class system,  one for all corporations and one for them.  </p><p>Antitrust, I don't know, if I were on the board of Amazon, I would spin the  AWS prophylactically, because I think that Facebook and Russia situation is  the tipping point, and we're starting to see that the worm has turned.   Whether or not antitrust I don' know.  You know where the war is going to  break out against big tech, Richard, it's going to break out in Europe who  registers all of the downside, the job destruction, tax avoidance of the  big tech companies, but registers very little of the upside.  The war is  going to break out against big tech in Europe.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you on Facebook?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  I am.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you use Amazon?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  I love all of them, I think they are fantastic.</p><p>QUEST:  but with a but dot, dot, dot.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, this is the big question.  What is always good for the  consumer always good for society?  And I think that's the fundamental  question.  </p><p>QUEST:  Glad you came in to talk about.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Thanks so much, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you, thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, tech companies are also disrupting our daily food  chains.  The Traders series now as we meet one company which is  capitalizing on our appetite for convenience.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A pang of hunger in Egypt starts a chain reaction which  crosses continents.  Cairo restaurant Al Dia prepares the dish.  </p><p>And in under 30 minutes it is ready to eat.  But the delivery of this meal  to the customer in Cairo relies on a billion-dollar company based in Berlin  5000 km away.</p><p>PIETER-JAN VANDEPITTE, COO, DELIVERY HERO:  Delivery Hero is a company  active in online food ordering, we actually grew into a global company with  activities in more than 40 countries.  And we operate almost like what I  called a little bit the United Nations of food delivery with strong  entrepreneurs in the countries.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Customers can order from thousands of restaurants using  the companies app.  Founded in 2011 Delivery Hero is hoping to stay ahead  of newcomers such as Uber Eats and Amazon.</p><p>VANDEPITTE:  In 2016, we had close to 200 million orders.  And we keep on  growing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The trade-enomics of food delivery is heating up.  The  global food market is worth $9 trillion.  Out of which the food delivery  sector is worth 99 billion.  In terms of the total food market pie, that  represents a mere one percent slice.</p><p>Such huge potential for growth has seen a frenzy of mergers and  acquisitions activity in the last three years as companies invest billions  to gobble up small arrivals.  Customers are hungry for convenience.</p><p>A click and swipe of a app will soon traditional phone calls as the most  convenient way to order.</p><p>In Cairo, the Delivery Hero brand management team collaborate with the  original service.</p><p>To stay ahead of the competition, Delivery Hero exports expertise in tech  and marketing to their regional companies.  </p><p>VANDEPITTE:  It is very important to understand the local ecosystem, and to  really develop the right product and technology for the local customer.  </p><p>[16:50:00] Geolocation is a fundamental part that we need to solve by  understanding the local needs.  And I give you an example of Saudi Arabia,  we don't have street names.  You don't have street numbers.  So, by having  technology to support the delivery boy, the delivery girl, to bring the  food to the customer, we contribute to creating an amazing take away  experience.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  As part of our ongoing commitment to fighting modern day slavery,  Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest tells me why every business needs a  social license.  You will hear him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Every chief executive has to run their business with a fine moral  code.  That is the view of Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire who  has turned his attention from mining to fighting modern-day slavery.  He  says it's the job of every chief exec to help navigate away, from such  dangers as these.  </p><p>You will be familiar with them from freedom project, human trafficking,  slave labor, sex workers, inherited debt.  When he joined me in the c suite  I asked Andrew Forest why the time has now come for executive moral  leadership.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW FOREST, FOUNDER, FORTESCUE METALS GROUP:  I think every CEO in the  world has to run their businesses with their own moral code and they must  have a fine moral code.  </p><p>If they don't have a fine moral code, they're not going to be sustainable,  Richard.  That will be found out by consumers.  That will be found out by  the law.  You need to have a right to do business.  You need a social  license to operate these days.  Ten years ago, you didn't.  </p><p>QUEST:  You just said, you need a social license to operate, so you are  accepting that there needs to be a social component, a social  responsibility, in the social leadership for a CEO.</p><p>FORREST:  Yes, Richard.  That's absolutely correct.  I fundamentally  believe that business and particularly chief executives in business, must  set standards they would like to see across society.  Society backs their  business.  They can only produce a profit and loss statement and a decent  balance sheet because of society.  They are responsible to society to act  morally.</p><p>QUEST:  So, let's take for example, in Australia, the marriage equality  battle at the moment, where one of your fellow Australians firmly came out  in favor.  Others have come out against.  It raises and I am genuinely not  trying to take you down into a tricky area.  But it raises the question of  which issues that one goes for.  I can understand modern-day slavery but  let's take the marriage equality.</p><p>FORREST:  No, no, Richard, you go for issues under your control.  You're  not a politician, you're not a person who has to ponder on everything.  </p><p>[16:55:00] What you control, like your labor supply chains, you should be  ready to stand in moral judgment of the quality of labor and freedom of  those laborers.</p><p>Now, if you are saying, which your view on marriage, sex, or whatever it  is, I don't have a view on it, I can't control it.  I'm not going to.  But  if you say to me what about your 3500 suppliers, how do you know there is  not slavery in those supply chains?</p><p>I would have to say to you, Richard, I don't but I'm looking and I am  trying.</p><p>QUEST:  On the question of modern day slavery, the ability to quantify --  we all know it is going on.  We all know it is at a horrific level.  But  the ability to provide verifiable statistics.  How significant is that?</p><p>FORREST:  I think it is very, very significant, I found out yesterday how  significant that was, when the ILO and walk free index published a common  number, not only were we shared on the table by your own Ivanka Trump who  was committing the United States to fight slavery around the world.  But  the other end of the table introducing us for the Secretary-General of the  United Nations, the Prime Minister of Britain, in lined up by the side was  state leaders from all over the world.  And their committing to slavery.   And why are they committing?  Because you now can measure in their  countries.</p><p>QUEST:  They are committing but I've got a word for you, results.</p><p>FORREST:  Thanks, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  I will say it again, results, they have gotten now actually do  something.  Results.</p><p>FORREST:  And that is why we need CNN to hold them to account, that's why  your role in your support against moderate slavery is critical because your  analysis drives results.  Transparency, measurement and media drives  results.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll hold you to account.  </p><p>FORREST:  Oh, you do, sir.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  </p><p>FORREST:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Spirited debate in the C-suite.

Closing bell ringing on  Wall Street.  Dow Jones at a record again, of .2 of 1 percent.  Nasdaq also  at a record high.  We'll bring you that in the trading post.  Otherwise,  sir, do the honors.  I declare that to be a firm gavel on Wednesday,  October the 11th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Walking away from Catalonia the president tells CNN, he want talks with  Madrid, as businesses are abandoning the Spanish region.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Walking away from NAFTA, President Trump is threatening to leave the deal,  as a new round of negotiations begin, the President's been meeting the  Canadian Prime Minister.  </p><p>And walking away from Weinstein.  The film company's partners consider  cancelling their various deals.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where, of course, I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  Tonight, five days that will decide the future of Catalonia  and indeed the cohesion of Spain.  The country's Prime Minister Mariano  Rajoy has given the Catalonian president until Monday to clarify if he's  declared independence or not.  With the IMF already warning contagion, his  answers whether this crisis is settled by dialogue or something more  dramatic.  </p><p>Both sides are now playing the waiting game.  Let me show you exactly how  this plays out.  If you take Spain, Madrid in the center, Barcelona on the  eastern coast.  Madrid and Catalonia are retreating behind their respective  red lines, a negotiating strategy.  And they're waiting to see if either of  the other side crosses the red line.  </p><p>So, let's take the Madrid side first.  If you look at Madrid, the Prime  Minister Rajoy has refused to hold talks unless the independence claim is  dropped.  And he's warning that Catalonia will do great damage to itself  and to business if it goes ahead with its independence.  Today he said the  crisis has already done more to hurt Catalan tourism than terror attacks in  Barcelona.  It's significantly -- Mariano Rajoy, the Prime Minister,  bearing in mind what the Catalan President did yesterday, the prime  minister says the next move is up to Catalonia.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIANO RAJOY, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  It is the  answer that Mr. Puigdemont will give to this issue that will mark the  future of what's going to happen next.  It is within his power to go back  to legality, and to institutional normality or to continue with an  instability period without perhaps losing Catalonia.  We are living one of  the worst moments in the recent history of democracy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Now, in his back pocket the prime minister always has the nuclear  option of Article 155 of, the Spanish constitution that would allow him to  basically impose direct rule once again on Catalonia.  If he were to do  that, well, on the other side, you have the red line from the Catalan  President, who is insisting on talks without preconditions.  Catalonia's  economy does give him some leverage.  It makes up about 20 percent of  Spanish GDP and pays much more into the tax system of Madrid and Spain than  it does get back from the country.  In an exclusive interview with CNN, the  Catalan President said it was time for proper talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLES PUIGDEMONT, CATALAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I believe that  today we find ourselves in a moment of most importance.  That we have no  prior conditions to sit down and talk.  Except that we must dialogue, and  we must dialogue within adequate conditions.  Maybe it could help dialogue  if two people from the Catalan government and two people from the Spanish  government simply agreed on one simple thing.  Appointing a mediator, for  instance.  But we cannot ignore the fact that talks apathetical discussions  need to come from recognizing reality.  </p><p>And that is what we need to talk about.  The relationship Catalonia, Spain,  it does not work and there is majority of Catalan people that want to make  Catalonia an independent state.  And want to do that in agreement with the  Spanish state.  But we need to do that without conditions.  We need to sit  down and really talk.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] QUEST:  Spanish investors are treating this entire incident with  a certain amount of trepidation and caution.  Let's just take today.  The  evidence for this is the way Spanish stocks rebound, from Tuesday's losses,  and outperformed the rest of Europe.  But really, at 1.3 percent gain in  the IBEX has to be seen the fall of the previous day, and almost certain  knowledge that if there was to be detrimental move tomorrow, that market  would turn down.  The cost of buying Spanish debt, which rises bond to its  lowest level of the month so far.  Again, the ten-year bond, this would  have to be seen in the context of an independence declaration or a  worsening situation that would send the bond higher, almost certainly.   Atika Shubert is live for us in Barcelona tonight.  This level of  uncertainty, Atika, these five days that the Prime Minister has given the  Catalonia President.  It's very tense.  </p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  absolutely.  I  mean, he's really turning the screws on Catalan President Puigdemont.  I  mean basically by asking him to clarify whether or not it was a declaration  of independence.  He's really trying to split, as well, the independence  movement.  Remember, it is fractured parliament here and Puigdemont is  really sitting on a coalition of many different interests.  </p><p>If he says for example, that no, it was only a symbolic declaration, then  he could find that he doesn't have the support from those much more  hardline separatists.  If he says, you know -- if he says it is declaration  of independence, well, that would be upping the stakes dramatically, a give  Rajoy a reason -- the Prime Minister a reason to come in and take over the  regional government.  So, he is really turning the screws on the Catalan  President.  How he's going to respond in the next few days is what we're  watching for.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  The idea of mediation, the idea of talks, would be what?   Talks about greater autonomy?  I mean, listening to that interview, with  Nic Robertson, where he talks about, you know, we have a right to  independence.  Well, even if you have temporary talks, talks to what?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  You know, the independence movement here goes back hundreds of  years really, it has deep historical roots.  But the most recent change  here happened in 2006, when there was autonomy statute that Catalan had  passed, and that was accepted by the Spanish government.  Then in 2010, the  constitutional, court struck that down.  And ever since independence then  the independence movement has been re-sparked.  It was basically revived  under that.  </p><p>So, if there were any talks to take place, it would be about this autonomy  statute.  What kind of an autonomy would Catalonia need?  What more would  they need?  Financial independence.  What else do they want?  And so, I  think that's what the talks in itself would be about.  But, you know, these  -- this idea that there will be no preconditions is something that the  Prime Minister says is absolutely a no go.  He Will not have any dialogue,  he says, until it's clear that there has not been a declaration of  independence.  </p><p>QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Barcelona.  Atika, thank you.  Let's talk to  Professor Luis Cabral of the International Business, NYU Stern.  Good to  see you Professor.  </p><p>LUIS CABRAL, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, NYU STERN:  Good to see  you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Where is the pressure coming from here?  There's the political  pressure in one since, but how significant is the business pressure?   Whether it's the Caixa Bank moving out, the other banks, the other  companies taking advantage.  Where does commerce come into it?  </p><p>CABRAL:  The biggest pressure is the large banks and large corporations  that are headquartered in Barcelona, and that are thinking very seriously  about moving to Madrid.  Because if there is independence or even if there  is a situation of uncertainty continues the way it is now, it's not good  business to be in Barcelona for them.  And that can have a huge negative  impact on the Catalonia economy.  In fact, that's already been happening  for a number of years, by the way, because of the language laws in  Catalonia.  So, this would only accelerate that movement.  </p><p>QUEST:  One assumes that the Catalonian government does not wish to commit  financial suicide, or at least economic suicide.  Now, similar arguments  with Scotland.  If they vote for independence, they leave the European  Union.  </p><p>CABRAL:  That's true.  And as of now, it's not clear what would happen to  Catalonia if there were to become independent.  You would need all of the  European Union countries to vote in favor of them becoming members of the  European Union.  And it's far from obvious that would be the case.  </p><p>QUEST:  Well, Spain certainly wouldn't and the United Kingdom wouldn't.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Probably not.  </p><p>QUEST:  Assuming the U.K. is still there, of course.</p><p>CABRAL:  That is correct.  And so, that's part of the potential cost of  independence.  Now, of course, it's not very credible to say that we will  never talk to you again.  And I think some sort of a deal agreement,  possibly even membership, would eventually be achieved, in my opinion.  </p><p>[16:10:00] QUEST:  But what do they want -- I mean, you heard me ask Atika  Shubert this.  When Catalonia suspends its declaration of independence, and  there's more talks or mediation, the two are diametrically opposed.  The  Prime Minister cannot give ground -- he said this tonight.  You know,  you've got five days to make it clear that you're not declaring  independence.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Yes.  I'm not sure that they were expecting Rajoy to be as strict  and strong as he's Ben right now.  Perhaps what they were thinking about --  who knows what they were thinking about.  It is perhaps they could  renegotiate the independent -- the autonomy statute and the shadow of  possible independence.  And they're just realizing that doesn't work.   That's not working.  At least Rajoy is playing hardball, and it seems to me  that Catalonia is going to lose this battle.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  And just to brief us -- for those who doesn't follow this  as closely as yourself -- the Spanish opposition at the national level is  also in favor of the Rajoy position.  I mean, they may not want such a  hardline position but Rajoy is speaking largely for the entire Spanish body  politic.  </p><p>CABRAL:  That is correct.  And for a significant fraction of Catalonia.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do we actually know?  </p><p>CABRAL:  We don't have the exact numbers my idea is that it's probably  split down the middle, very close to 50/50.  </p><p>QUEST:  Which is a very dangerous area to go into some call for  independence, claiming you have a mandate when 50 percent of the people  actually don't want anything to do with it.  </p><p>CABRAL:  Exactly.  So, there is a majority of people a referendum voted in  favor of independence.  But the turnout was quite low.  And so, there's  probably about 50 percent of Catalonians who are against independence.  At  least in the way that's being prosed right now.  And so, it's a difficult - - and the president -- the leader of Catalonia, in my opinion, is between a  rock and a hard place, because the more extremist Catalonians are pushing  very hard for independence.  But on the other hand, it just realized it  would be tough for him if he were to go ahead with independence right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, professor.  Thank you very much indeed.  Much  appreciated.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Spain's economy minister will be joining me live on tomorrow night's  program.  Luis de Guindos will be with us at the annual meeting of the lMF  in Washington.  You can see that interview, as well as my debate on the  global economy with the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde.  It is  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tomorrow at this time, live from Washington.  </p><p>So, we need too immediately to our new trading post, and all three -- let  me find -- here we go.  All three of the markets have closed at record.   That means it's the 48th record of the year for the Dow.  The 44th for the  S&amp;P.  And crucially, it is the 56th for the Nasdaq.  One of the reasons --  not only just the news generally -- but one of the reasons for these three  records, the Fed minutes said that there needed to be some patience with  raising rates.  The minutes just came out.  </p><p>Delta Airlines despite the incidents of hurricanes and other delays, Delta  Airlines had earnings better than expected.  So, put this together, and  you've got records on the Dow over 20 -- I mean, 23,000 is looking  extremely touchable and within grasp on the S&amp;P 500 and on the Nasdaq.   You've got nearly 50 records on the Dow.  And no wonder Donald Trump, the  president, has described the market movements as unprecedented.  And the  signs of fear in the market at the moment, absolutely nothing there.  But  remain at 84 on the CNN Money fear and greed index, which is one of extreme  greed.  As you can see, green just about all around the set as we have got  Paul La Monica.  All three are records.  And not just that, good records.   The momentum is there.  There're not eking out these records.  They seem to  want to head there.  </p><p>PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, these are solid gains.   And I think we've talked about this on the show.  Pretty much since the  beginning of the year.  I think a lot of it, despite the President taking  credit for it, is in spite of what's going on in Washington.  Corporate  earnings have been good.  You noted Delta.  We had Blackrock reporting some  good results.  And hopefully Will get decent ones from the big thanks later  this week.  But consumers still spending, corporations still spending.  I'm  just not so sure this is about politics, because, again, as my colleague  Matt Eagan pointed out, we had a lot of records under President Obama, too.   It's not a unique phenomenon -- </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, but 48 in a year.  It's not a -- I mean, we'll need to find  out.  Maybe you could get CNNMoney to see if this is a record so far in  terms of number of records </p><p>LA MONICA:  A record of records.  </p><p>QUEST:  A record of records.  Thank you.  A record of records.  The IMF  meets.  They've warmed about inequality.  </p><p>[16:15:00] Schauble has warned about bubbles and imbalances that exist out  there, as a result of liquidity.  The Fed today suggesting that patience  might be required from the September meeting.  Does that put off a rate  rise to next year?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I doubt it.  I think that the Fed will probably try and sneak  in one more rate hike in December, as long as earnings remain pretty strong  and the market is doing well.  And, of course, they're looking at  inflation, which is starting to creep up a little bit, because of wage  growth.  We had a very nice jobs report last week with regards to what the  wage growth number was, even though we lost jobs last month.  We did get  nearly 3 percentage wage growth.  And the Fed, I think, is watching that  very closely.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, Coach has become tapestry.  And we think that it might have  something to do with this.  Have a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAROL KING, SONGWRITER, RECORDING ARTIST:  Now my tapestry is unraveling. He's come to take me back.   He's come to take me back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Carol King.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, very, very nice.  Very well-played.  I seriously doubt  that that was the motivation.  I did speak to someone at Coach.  As they  now -- they now call it --</p><p>QUEST:  Don't ruin the day.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  -- they now call it tapestry -- they did acknowledge -- it's a  bit of a cutesy name that plays off the whole notion of weaving several  brands into one.  Putting that all aside, this is really similar to what we  had with Alphabet and Google.  There is nothing that people go to that is  Alphabet per se.  You still go to Google.  You go to YouTube.  In the same  way here with Coach, the Coach brand name -- if you like to buy handbag and  wallets from Coach, it's still going to be called Coach.  They're still  going to have Kate Spade, and Sarah Wiseman, the other two brand they  recently acquired.  And I think that's what this signals.  Maybe Coach  wants to do another deal.  And having an umbrella sort of name to house all  of these different brands, that seems to what they're looking to do.  </p><p>QUEST:  I seem to have left my wallet.  Could you lend m, a bit of money --  Paul thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Extraordinary.  More developments as show business -- the world of  show business turns against Harvey Weinstein.  And the allegations are  piling up.  Now the Manhattan District Attorney is defending his decision  not to charge Weinstein with sex crimes.  You're going to hear from him  next.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Straight to Washington, where the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin  Trudeau, is speaking to reporters after meeting with the U.S. President.  </p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  We know that the success of any  society depends on the full socioeconomic participation of women, because  women succeed, we all succeed.  And whether it's flexible hours, parental  leave, affordable child care, diversity training, equal pay, or any other  number of initiatives.  It's incumbent of us across the public and private  spheres to be proud agents for change.  </p><p>[16:20:08] Following that theme, this morning I had a productive round  table with WomenOne, where we discussed the current barriers to global  gender equality and marked the international day of the girl.  I also met  with the committee on ways and means, and we had a great conversation about  the importance of the Canada/U.S. partnership.  And I just wrapped up a  very good meeting with President Trump, where we talked about trade,  security and economic growth.  As we know, the fourth round of NAFTA  negotiations is under way here in Washington.  And the President and I  reiterated our commitment to in good tired faith to give this deal a much- needed upgrade.  NAFTA has benefited millions of people and can benefit  millions more.  We're pleased to have the opportunity to modernize this  trade agreement for the current economy, a modernization that acknowledges  the importance of gender, the environment and indigenous and labor rights.  </p><p>We know that there are millions of jobs on both sides of the Canada/U.S.  border that rely on trade and investment.  In fact, Canada is among the top  export markets for the majority of U.S. states.  And so, it's imperative  that we get a fair deal for Canadians, Americans and Mexicans alike.   That's what our teams at all orders of government are working hard towards.  </p><p>QUEST:  Justin Trudeau, talking there on NAFTA.  He describes NAFTA as an  upgrade to NAFTA, to modernize it.  We'll get more details on that in the  hours ahead.  Also talking about women and the whole gender question.   Harvey Weinstein comes into all of this, of course.  Harvey Weinstein, the  Hollywood producer, is on his way to rehab.  His wife of ten years has left  him.  The company -- the Weinstein Company is facing an uncertain future.   The claims of sexual misconduct just keep coming.  More women are accusing  the Hollywood producer of rape.  We must stress, Harvey Weinstein denies  those claims.  The indications are the allegations haven't finished.   Amazon is reviewing its projects with the Weinstein Company.  This week his  name was removed from the credits of its shows like \"Project Runway.\"  The  Weinstein Company board has expressed shock and dismay at new allegations  of extreme sexual misconduct and assault.</p><p>An earlier than Manhattan District Attorney explained his decision not to  press charges in the past.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CY VANCE, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  I understand that folks -- folks  are outraged by his behavior.  I understand that there are many other  allegations that have surfaced, but I our case, we really did what I think  the law obligates us to do.  Focus on the evidence and the facts that we  have.  and then I relied on the true professionals to help guide to the  decision, which is not always going to be the popular decision.  That's the  nature of being a prosecutor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  In the past few minutes, the Academy of Motion Picture and Arts --  basically the Oscars -- say they will hold a special meeting on Saturday  about the Weinstein allegations.  We have Erin Gloria Ryan is here.  Senior  editor for \"The Daily Beast\" and a CNN contributor.  In an op-ed for \"The  Daily Beast\" she defended victims who are reluctant to come forward.  It's  not surprising they're reluctant to come forward, is it?  They are promised  anonymity, or they are promised safe harbor, but the reality is most of  them know that until it becomes a cause celeb like this, they could be  alone, and they could be victimized.  </p><p>ERIN GLORIA RYAN, SENIOR EDITOR, THE DAILY BEAST:  Right.  I think any time  you're a woman who comes forward with this sort of allegation, you've got  someone as powerful as Harvey Weinstein, you're basically setting off an  atomic bomb with yourself at the center -- which I wrote in the piece for  \"The Daily Beast.\"  It's so risky, and it's so unlikely that you're going  to come out of it unscathed by your own career.  </p><p>QUEST:  What is the answer in that situation?  Because you're talking about  a real politic situation, where an individual goes up against a famous or  powerful person.  How does a company adapt then to allow for that?</p><p>RYAN:  I think that brings up a very interesting point.  Because Weinstein  couldn't have done this without all the people that were enabling him along  the way.  There were people who were more powerful than the actresses he is  he was allegedly victimizing who knew about this.  Who didn't say anything.   There were ostensibly film executives who heard about this who didn't do  anything.  There's an entertainment press that in their thirst for access  was willing two just, you know, just push their morals aside in order to  keep these buried.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you think people knew how bad it was or how egregious it was?  </p><p>RYAN:  I don't want to speculate on whether everybody knew every detail of  it.  I think this is the first time we've seen all these, kind of stomach- churning details in one place.  I think the fact that people had indicators  that there might be something that bad there and didn't speak up is pretty  damning to the culture of entertainment as a whole.  </p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST:  But are we in danger -- and I'm choosing my words  carefully and I'm treading delicately.  Are we in danger of turning Harvey  Weinstein into the devil incarnate with all the coverage, and everybody  heaping more opprobrium on top of him?  When the real story is not  Weinstein per se.  It is how it was able to perpetuate.  </p><p>RYAN:  I think it definitely is that.  I think it's also the way that this  -- this isn't just him.  And this isn't just this industry.  When I was  listening to that tape yesterday, there's a tape that the New York Police  Department got in a sting in 2015.  I was listening to that yesterday.   He's trying to coerce a woman into his hotel room.  I related to that tape  so much.  Not because Weinstein ever targeted me.  But because me and every  single woman I know has had a man try to treat us that way in our lives.  </p><p>It's something endemic to American culture.  It's something that's endemic  to different industries.  Media, tech, trucking, service.  This is a  conversation we should be having nationally.  It should be not just about  Weinstein.  Because getting him out of there is not going to fix the  problem.  But we should be doing is teaching men about consent.  And what  we should be doing is teaching men in a position to stand up they need to.  </p><p>QUEST:  So let me ask you, and I ask this as somebody who's got three  sisters and been around this issue most of me adult life -- most of my  life.  What then does need to be done.  To happen, to have that  conversation, to make them?  Because these allegations, in some shape or  form, sexual harassment has been known about by men for a very long time.  </p><p>RYAN:  Yes.  I think that the important thing is for men to take a couple  minutes and be alone and silent with themselves today and consider whether  or not they've ever enabled this sort of behavior.  And how they can  personally not enable it in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Very grateful you came and talked to us.  Thank you so much indeed.  </p><p>We'll continue tonight.  NAFTA negotiations on round.  We just heard the  Canadian Prime Minister describe it as an upgrade to NAFTA.  The talks are  resuming, and Justin Trudeau turns on the charm at the White House.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  in a moment.  When the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning President  Trump's position on NAFTA is full of poison pills.  And we give Apple,  Google, Amazon and Facebook, an all-access pass into our lives.  A  marketing professor says there is a reason for that.  </p><p>As we continue tonight this is CNN, and on this network, the news always  comes first.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is rejecting Catalonia's call for negotiating  independence from Spain, the prime minister has given the Catalan President  Carles Puigdemont until Monday to clarify whether his vision has declared independence or  not.</p><p>[16:30:00] If the answer is yes, and Puigdemont refuses to reconsider by  the following Thursday, Prime Minister Rajoy says Madrid could then impose  direct rule.</p><p>Firefighters in California are having a tough time, as they battle massive  fires, winds are expected to pick up in the area.  That could threaten to  spread the blaze.  So far, there's no rain in the forecast.  At least 21  people have been killed.  Hundreds more people are missing.  Early  estimates suggest property value damage is more than $65 billion.  </p><p>Multiple sources close to the White House tell CNN that President Trump is  expected to appoint Kirstjen Nielsen as the new U.S. Secretary of Homeland  Security.  The 45-year-old Nielsen would fill the vacancy left by John  Kelly who is now the chief of staff.  She currently works now as a deputy  to Kelly.</p><p>President Trump says he is stronger and tougher on North Korea than his  secretary of state.  Earlier Pyongyang's foreign minister says President  Trump in his words lit the wick of war in his speech at the United Nations  General Assembly.  Mr. Trump put North Korea's leader on notice in that  address, referring to Kim Jong-un as rocket man, in saying that the country  would not survive an American attack.</p><p>Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond says that although the U.K.  economy is fundamentally robust, Brexit is causing a cloud of certainty,  which needs to be cleared.  Hammond told lawmakers the U.K. should prepare  for the worst if no Brexit deal is reached with the E.U.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILIP HAMMOND, FINANCE MINISTER, GREAT BRITAIN:  We also have to consider  the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations, where we have  noncooperation.  Worst-case scenario, even a situation where people are not  necessarily acting in their own economic self-interest.  So, we need to  prepare for a wide range of scenarios.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  The top U.S. business lobby group is warning that NAFTA  negotiations are at risk of complete collapse as the latest round of talks  actually get underway.</p><p>The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau who you heard a moment ago was  at the White House meeting the president, who you heard, has repeatedly  threatened to leave NAFTA.  President Trump said whatever happens, a new  deal has to be fair to all sides.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's possible we won't be  able to make a deal, and it's possible that we will.  We have a great  personal relationship, and we have a relationship now is two countries that  is as close as ever.  But we will see if we can do the changes that we  need.  We have to protect our workers and in all fairness the prime  minister was to protect Canada and his people also/</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  On the eve of the talks that are about to start, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, chief executive Tom Donahue has criticized the Trump  administration for putting what it calls poison pill proposals into the  negotiations.  What are these poison pill various different things?  OK.  </p><p>Here you have, of course, the NAFTA area, Canada, the United States and  Mexico.  And the NAFTA negotiation in round 4, you can hear the poison  pills are rattling around the medicine cabinet.  The first one is the rules  of origin, determining how much of product must be manufactured in north  America to remain duty-free.  For example, the car industry, most at risk,  62 percent if the current rule.</p><p>Trump wants that to be higher and he wants within the rules of origin  specificity so that it's not just one country.  It specifies how much has  to come from the United States, which, of course, would defeat the whole  object of having the single market.  </p><p>Then you have a sunset clause, the U.S. wants NAFTA to expire every five  years until all three countries agree to whatever changes are necessary.   However, business says what's the point of having a NAFTA treaty if every  five years -- I mean let's face it, businesses are making 10, 15, 20-year  decisions, not five-year momentary decisions. So, they say that is not going to work.</p><p>And finally, dispute resolution.  U.S. wants to ditch the neutral  arbitration mechanism.  Put it all together, and you have poison pills that  could scupper, because the others will not agree.  The Mexicans and  Canadians will not agree to these fairly dramatic situations.  </p><p>At any rate to put this into perspective, Paula Newton who was up in Ottawa  with the Canadian position, Clare Sebastian is following the U.S. position.   We'll start with you, Paula, Ms.  Newton, because your prime minister is in  the United States at the moment.  Is Canada prepared for failure of these  talks in the same way that President Trump seemingly is?  </p><p>[16:35:00] PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, and I know  speaking to the Canadian officials behind the scenes that they do not put  it past the president to eventually, because he needs those campaign wins,  most political wins, Richard, to do what he says might do which is  terminate the deal.</p><p>But this is what the Canadians are doing.  Before that meeting with Trump,  Justin Trudeau was on Capitol Hill talking to a very powerful committee  there, the committee that is stacked with Republicans to know how important  Canada is in terms of a trading relationship for their states.  And they  are saying, look.  Number one, Canada is the U.S.'s largest customer, more  trade, the by more than the U.K., China, Japan combined.  In number two,  even if the president signs an executive order, ending NAFTA, it is  Congress that has the final say as to whether that happens.  There might be  some constitutional dispute about that.  We'll wait and see.  But right  now, Congress is saying, we do hold sway here.  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is because he's  renegotiating NAFTA at the moment, Richard.  Remember on the campaign trail  and in fact multiple times including this week President Trump has  threatened to rip the whole thing up just do away with it.  In that he can  do unilaterally.  It's called article 2205 and NAFTA, he's allowed to just  make that decision, that would trigger a six-month process where he could  rescind the decision during that six months but he can do it.</p><p>QUEST:  But Clare there is no movement as yet, seemingly they are  negotiating, but these poison pills are destined to scupper because they  are perceived to be not in good faith.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  Those of us with untrained eyes in the area of  trade deals, there is -- doesn't seem to be any way that the three sides  can agree on this.  Mexico is deeply alarmed by the whole rules of origin  thing the U.S. could apply one rule to themselves, one to something else.   Canada is alarmed of getting rid of dispute settlements.  </p><p>QUEST:  Pause there.  Stay with me, Paula.  Justin Trudeau is answering  questions.  Let's have a listen.</p><p>JUSTIN Trudeau, Prime Minister, Canada:  How good NAFTA has been for  millions of citizens of Canada, of the United States and indeed for Mexico.   I know there are opportunities to significantly improve these trade deals  in ways that will benefit citizens right across United States and Canada as  well</p><p>And I truly believe that we can work together in a meaningful way to bring  those benefits to our citizens.  Negotiations are difficult.  Unpredictable  at times but I truly believe that the presidents focused on creating  benefits for his citizens, for the middle class the way we are.  And that  positive trade deals, modernized trade deals, we will get that done.  So  that is something that I continue to focus on.  The conversations we've had  with the way and means committee, the conversations I've had with governors  across the country., the conversations I've had with various leaders of  industry have all emphasized that they see the direct benefits that NAFTA  has brought to their communities, to their economies, and can continue to  bring in the future.  so --</p><p>QUEST:  So, Paula Newton in Ottawa.  Does he believe that?  I mean, you  said to me he's preparing to leave.  Or, no, he's recognizing that that  could be an option.  Nuclear option.  </p><p>[16:40:00] NEWTON:  It is.  But it will be Donald Trump's to trigger or  their decision to walk away from the table.  They need to prepare for those  talks to break down.  You heard him now that isn't much different from what  he said from the last few months.  What is important is what happened in  the last couple hours.  He took the measure of the president and tried to  determine exactly how serious he is, not about terminating NAFTA, but how  serious he is about going back to those poison pills.  What determines a  win for Donald Trump?</p><p>And that's what the prime minister was trying to find out, and we'll know  in the next little while whether he got to that end, and will instruct his  negotiators accordingly.  </p><p>QUEST:  Paula and Clare, thank you.</p><p>Four giants of technology, and they have one goal.  In a moment, the inside  story to the race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Google has had to admit there is a bug in its new home mini  speaker.  Tech bloggers discovered the smart speaker secretly recorded just  about everything it hears Google issued a software update to turn off the  function.  The device expected to go on sale next week.  </p><p>As for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they seem to dominate headlines  and our very lives.  Take the last 48 hour for example.  This is a list of  headlines.  Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping.  Amazon  exploring ways to deliver items inside your home.  Zuckerberg apologizes  for Puerto Rico VR stunt.  </p><p>Apple strikes deal with Spielberg's Amblin.</p><p>As Professor Scott Galloway of marketing at NYU Stern, the author of, \"The  Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google.\"</p><p>Why are they so successful?  Is it because they have basically come up with  something that we find that we actually need?  Admittedly, we didn't know  about it before but that is because it had not been invented.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR, NYU STERN:  Yes, it runs deeper than  that, Richard.  Google is our modern man' god.  As we become wealthier,  more educated, we're less dependent on a super being, but still he huge  questions.  Used to pray to the gods, will my kid be all right.  Now  symptoms in treatment of croup typed into the Google query box.  When the  six questions have never been asked before that are presented to Google in  the history of mankind.  No coach, Rabbi, priest has that sort of  credibility, Google is our modern God.</p><p>Facebook taps into our need to love and love others through pictures that  reinforce relationships.  Amazon is our consumptive gut.  More for less is  always a strategy that works.  An Apple appeals to our reproductive organs,  Apple is a new symbol of wealth, power, innovation and says you have better  genes to potential mates.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, but at the end of the day, they are doing a good job, they are  doing what they say they will do.  You can't fault them.  And in this  digital age of the Internet economy, they are serving a purpose.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  They do a great job.  And I don't fault them.  I think the  question is, should we as a society ask questions around, do we no longer  worship at the altar of kindness and character but innovation and hold  these companies to different standard than we hold other companies?  </p><p>Your firm, this firm, wasn't weaponized by Russia.  You have checks and  balances in place that cost you a lot of money and reduce your bottom line.   Yet we have decided to Google and Facebook aren't subject to the same  responsibilities as other media companies.</p><p>QUEST:  Is the possibility on that point, on the weaponization, for  example, the weaponization of Facebook, which -- you're concerned about.  </p><p>[16:45:00] That really, it's happened much faster.  it may have taken 40  years for this company to have got size, heft and a certain amount of  influence and power.</p><p>But the speed with which these are, we haven't had time to put in place the  necessary safeguards.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  The technology and innovation has outpaced the public policy or  ability to realm with it.  A lot of people believe that Facebook is not  even sure they know what they fully have right now.</p><p>QUEST:  Let's look at the graphs of share prices which I now is not exactly  a barometer of anything other than people's wealth.  But if you look at,  say, for example, any of them, Apple, Amazon, Google -- here's Apple.   Facebook -- I beg your pardon.  Look at that.  Pretty much solid that  afterwards everybody said, oh lord, this has gone badly.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  So, the combined market capitalization of these four companies  is equivalent to the GDP of India.  Amazon which is paid 1.4 billion in  corporate income tax whereas Walmart has paid 64 billion since the great  recession, it Amazon has added the value of Walmart to its market in the  last 24 months.  We have never seen companies this powerful.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, if you accept, and you have at the beginning of this, that  they're serving a purpose, they're doing it extremely well.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  And there's a need or we've discovered a need for what they want.   Are you suggesting regulation to impose those forms of safeguards, checks  and balances that a Time Warner has?  Or are you looking at something like  antitrust, break them up?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  I'm suggesting we hold them to the same standards we hold other  companies and we begin to ask hard questions -- I think we suffer from a  gross idolatry of innovation and youth that has created two-class system,  one for all corporations and one for them.  </p><p>Antitrust, I don't know, if I were on the board of Amazon, I would spin the  AWS prophylactically, because I think that Facebook and Russia situation is  the tipping point, and we're starting to see that the worm has turned.   Whether or not antitrust I don' know.  You know where the war is going to  break out against big tech, Richard, it's going to break out in Europe who  registers all of the downside, the job destruction, tax avoidance of the  big tech companies, but registers very little of the upside.  The war is  going to break out against big tech in Europe.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you on Facebook?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  I am.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you use Amazon?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  I love all of them, I think they are fantastic.</p><p>QUEST:  but with a but dot, dot, dot.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, this is the big question.  What is always good for the  consumer always good for society?  And I think that's the fundamental  question.  </p><p>QUEST:  Glad you came in to talk about.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Thanks so much, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you, thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, tech companies are also disrupting our daily food  chains.

Cairo restaurant Al Dia prepares the dish.  </p><p>And in under 30 minutes it is ready to eat.  But the delivery of this meal  to the customer in Cairo relies on a billion-dollar company based in Berlin  5000 km away.</p><p>PIETER-JAN VANDEPITTE, COO, DELIVERY HERO:  Delivery Hero is a company  active in online food ordering, we actually grew into a global company with  activities in more than 40 countries.  And we operate almost like what I  called a little bit the United Nations of food delivery with strong  entrepreneurs in the countries.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Customers can order from thousands of restaurants using  the companies app.  Founded in 2011 Delivery Hero is hoping to stay ahead  of newcomers such as Uber Eats and Amazon.</p><p>VANDEPITTE:  In 2016, we had close to 200 million orders.  And we keep on  growing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The trade-enomics of food delivery is heating up.  The  global food market is worth $9 trillion.  Out of which the food delivery  sector is worth 99 billion.  In terms of the total food market pie, that  represents a mere one percent slice.</p><p>Such huge potential for growth has seen a frenzy of mergers and  acquisitions activity in the last three years as companies invest billions  to gobble up small arrivals.

You will hear him after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Every chief executive has to run their business with a fine moral  code.  That is the view of Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire who  has turned his attention from mining to fighting modern-day slavery.  He  says it's the job of every chief exec to help navigate away, from such  dangers as these.  </p><p>You will be familiar with them from freedom project, human trafficking,  slave labor, sex workers, inherited debt.  When he joined me in the c suite  I asked Andrew Forest why the time has now come for executive moral  leadership.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW FOREST, FOUNDER, FORTESCUE METALS GROUP:  I think every CEO in the  world has to run their businesses with their own moral code and they must  have a fine moral code.  </p><p>If they don't have a fine moral code, they're not going to be sustainable,  Richard.  That will be found out by consumers.  That will be found out by  the law.  You need to have a right to do business.  You need a social  license to operate these days.  Ten years ago, you didn't.  </p><p>QUEST:  You just said, you need a social license to operate, so you are  accepting that there needs to be a social component, a social  responsibility, in the social leadership for a CEO.</p><p>FORREST:  Yes, Richard.  That's absolutely correct.  I fundamentally  believe that business and particularly chief executives in business, must  set standards they would like to see across society.  Society backs their  business.  They can only produce a profit and loss statement and a decent  balance sheet because of society.  They are responsible to society to act  morally.</p><p>QUEST:  So, let's take for example, in Australia, the marriage equality  battle at the moment, where one of your fellow Australians firmly came out  in favor.  Others have come out against.  It raises and I am genuinely not  trying to take you down into a tricky area.  But it raises the question of  which issues that one goes for.  I can understand modern-day slavery but  let's take the marriage equality.</p><p>FORREST:  No, no, Richard, you go for issues under your control.  You're  not a politician, you're not a person who has to ponder on everything.  </p><p>[16:55:00] What you control, like your labor supply chains, you should be  ready to stand in moral judgment of the quality of labor and freedom of  those laborers.</p><p>Now, if you are saying, which your view on marriage, sex, or whatever it  is, I don't have a view on it, I can't control it.  I'm not going to.  But  if you say to me what about your 3500 suppliers, how do you know there is  not slavery in those supply chains?</p><p>I would have to say to you, Richard, I don't but I'm looking and I am  trying.</p><p>QUEST:  On the question of modern day slavery, the ability to quantify --  we all know it is going on.  We all know it is at a horrific level.  But  the ability to provide verifiable statistics.  How significant is that?</p><p>FORREST:  I think it is very, very significant, I found out yesterday how  significant that was, when the ILO and walk free index published a common  number, not only were we shared on the table by your own Ivanka Trump who  was committing the United States to fight slavery around the world.  But  the other end of the table introducing us for the Secretary-General of the  United Nations, the Prime Minister of Britain, in lined up by the side was  state leaders from all over the world.  And their committing to slavery.   And why are they committing?  Because you now can measure in their  countries.</p><p>QUEST:  They are committing but I've got a word for you, results.</p><p>FORREST:  Thanks, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  I will say it again, results, they have gotten now actually do  something.  Results.</p><p>FORREST:  And that is why we need CNN to hold them to account, that's why  your role in your support against moderate slavery is critical because your  analysis drives results.  Transparency, measurement and media drives  results.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll hold you to account.  </p><p>FORREST:  Oh, you do, sir.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  </p><p>FORREST:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Spirited debate in the C-suite.  We'll have a Profitable Moment  after the break.  This is CNN.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  It's worth looking ahead to tomorrow  night's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS which comes from the IMF, International  Monetary Fund's annual meetings.  </p><p>Tomorrow night we will have the debate it will be between Christine  Lagarde, the French finance minister, the Indonesians, the Canadian finance  minister.  And hear what they say on the issues of austerity, what they say  about inequality, how they believe that the bubbles and inequalities and  imbalances in the economies at the moment could be dealt with in the  future.</p><p>QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from the IMF live tomorrow night.</p><p>Otherwise, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight from New York.  I'm  Richard Quest.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's  profitable.  I'll see you in Washington tomorrow!</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on  Wall Street.  Dow Jones at a record again, of .2 of 1 percent.  Nasdaq also  at a record high.  We'll bring you that in the trading post.  Otherwise,  sir, do the honors.  I declare that to be a firm gavel on Wednesday,  October the 11th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Walking away from Catalonia the president tells CNN, he want talks with  Madrid, as businesses are abandoning the Spanish region.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Walking away from NAFTA, President Trump is threatening to leave the deal,  as a new round of negotiations begin, the President's been meeting the  Canadian Prime Minister.  </p><p> And walking away from Weinstein.  The film company's partners consider  cancelling their various deals.  </p><p> I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where, of course, I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  Tonight, five days that will decide the future of Catalonia  and indeed the cohesion of Spain.  The country's Prime Minister Mariano  Rajoy has given the Catalonian president until Monday to clarify if he's  declared independence or not.  With the IMF already warning contagion, his  answers whether this crisis is settled by dialogue or something more  dramatic.  </p><p> Both sides are now playing the waiting game.  Let me show you exactly how  this plays out.  If you take Spain, Madrid in the center, Barcelona on the  eastern coast.  Madrid and Catalonia are retreating behind their respective  red lines, a negotiating strategy.  And they're waiting to see if either of  the other side crosses the red line.  </p><p> So, let's take the Madrid side first.  If you look at Madrid, the Prime  Minister Rajoy has refused to hold talks unless the independence claim is  dropped.  And he's warning that Catalonia will do great damage to itself  and to business if it goes ahead with its independence.  Today he said the  crisis has already done more to hurt Catalan tourism than terror attacks in  Barcelona.  It's significantly -- Mariano Rajoy, the Prime Minister,  bearing in mind what the Catalan President did yesterday, the prime  minister says the next move is up to Catalonia.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARIANO RAJOY, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  It is the  answer that Mr. Puigdemont will give to this issue that will mark the  future of what's going to happen next.  It is within his power to go back  to legality, and to institutional normality or to continue with an  instability period without perhaps losing Catalonia.  We are living one of  the worst moments in the recent history of democracy.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Now, in his back pocket the prime minister always has the nuclear  option of Article 155 of, the Spanish constitution that would allow him to  basically impose direct rule once again on Catalonia.  If he were to do  that, well, on the other side, you have the red line from the Catalan  President, who is insisting on talks without preconditions.  Catalonia's  economy does give him some leverage.  It makes up about 20 percent of  Spanish GDP and pays much more into the tax system of Madrid and Spain than  it does get back from the country.  In an exclusive interview with CNN, the  Catalan President said it was time for proper talks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLES PUIGDEMONT, CATALAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I believe that  today we find ourselves in a moment of most importance.  That we have no  prior conditions to sit down and talk.  Except that we must dialogue, and  we must dialogue within adequate conditions.  Maybe it could help dialogue  if two people from the Catalan government and two people from the Spanish  government simply agreed on one simple thing.  Appointing a mediator, for  instance.  But we cannot ignore the fact that talks apathetical discussions  need to come from recognizing reality.  </p><p> And that is what we need to talk about.  The relationship Catalonia, Spain,  it does not work and there is majority of Catalan people that want to make  Catalonia an independent state.  And want to do that in agreement with the  Spanish state.  But we need to do that without conditions.  We need to sit  down and really talk.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [16:05:00] QUEST:  Spanish investors are treating this entire incident with  a certain amount of trepidation and caution.  Let's just take today.  The  evidence for this is the way Spanish stocks rebound, from Tuesday's losses,  and outperformed the rest of Europe.  But really, at 1.3 percent gain in  the IBEX has to be seen the fall of the previous day, and almost certain  knowledge that if there was to be detrimental move tomorrow, that market  would turn down.  The cost of buying Spanish debt, which rises bond to its  lowest level of the month so far.  Again, the ten-year bond, this would  have to be seen in the context of an independence declaration or a  worsening situation that would send the bond higher, almost certainly.   Atika Shubert is live for us in Barcelona tonight.  This level of  uncertainty, Atika, these five days that the Prime Minister has given the  Catalonia President.  It's very tense.  </p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  absolutely.  I  mean, he's really turning the screws on Catalan President Puigdemont.  I  mean basically by asking him to clarify whether or not it was a declaration  of independence.  He's really trying to split, as well, the independence  movement.  Remember, it is fractured parliament here and Puigdemont is  really sitting on a coalition of many different interests.  </p><p> If he says for example, that no, it was only a symbolic declaration, then  he could find that he doesn't have the support from those much more  hardline separatists.  If he says, you know -- if he says it is declaration  of independence, well, that would be upping the stakes dramatically, a give  Rajoy a reason -- the Prime Minister a reason to come in and take over the  regional government.  So, he is really turning the screws on the Catalan  President.  How he's going to respond in the next few days is what we're  watching for.  </p><p> QUEST:  OK.  The idea of mediation, the idea of talks, would be what?   Talks about greater autonomy?  I mean, listening to that interview, with  Nic Robertson, where he talks about, you know, we have a right to  independence.  Well, even if you have temporary talks, talks to what?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  You know, the independence movement here goes back hundreds of  years really, it has deep historical roots.  But the most recent change  here happened in 2006, when there was autonomy statute that Catalan had  passed, and that was accepted by the Spanish government.  Then in 2010, the  constitutional, court struck that down.  And ever since independence then  the independence movement has been re-sparked.  It was basically revived  under that.  </p><p> So, if there were any talks to take place, it would be about this autonomy  statute.  What kind of an autonomy would Catalonia need?  What more would  they need?  Financial independence.  What else do they want?  And so, I  think that's what the talks in itself would be about.  But, you know, these  -- this idea that there will be no preconditions is something that the  Prime Minister says is absolutely a no go.  He Will not have any dialogue,  he says, until it's clear that there has not been a declaration of  independence.  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Barcelona.  Atika, thank you.  Let's talk to  Professor Luis Cabral of the International Business, NYU Stern.  Good to  see you Professor.  </p><p> LUIS CABRAL, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, NYU STERN:  Good to see  you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Where is the pressure coming from here?  There's the political  pressure in one since, but how significant is the business pressure?   Whether it's the Caixa Bank moving out, the other banks, the other  companies taking advantage.  Where does commerce come into it?  </p><p> CABRAL:  The biggest pressure is the large banks and large corporations  that are headquartered in Barcelona, and that are thinking very seriously  about moving to Madrid.  Because if there is independence or even if there  is a situation of uncertainty continues the way it is now, it's not good  business to be in Barcelona for them.  And that can have a huge negative  impact on the Catalonia economy.  In fact, that's already been happening  for a number of years, by the way, because of the language laws in  Catalonia.  So, this would only accelerate that movement.  </p><p> QUEST:  One assumes that the Catalonian government does not wish to commit  financial suicide, or at least economic suicide.  Now, similar arguments  with Scotland.  If they vote for independence, they leave the European  Union.  </p><p> CABRAL:  That's true.  And as of now, it's not clear what would happen to  Catalonia if there were to become independent.  You would need all of the  European Union countries to vote in favor of them becoming members of the  European Union.  And it's far from obvious that would be the case.  </p><p> QUEST:  Well, Spain certainly wouldn't and the United Kingdom wouldn't.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Probably not.  </p><p> QUEST:  Assuming the U.K. is still there, of course.</p><p> CABRAL:  That is correct.  And so, that's part of the potential cost of  independence.  Now, of course, it's not very credible to say that we will  never talk to you again.  And I think some sort of a deal agreement,  possibly even membership, would eventually be achieved, in my opinion.  </p><p> [16:10:00] QUEST:  But what do they want -- I mean, you heard me ask Atika  Shubert this.  When Catalonia suspends its declaration of independence, and  there's more talks or mediation, the two are diametrically opposed.  The  Prime Minister cannot give ground -- he said this tonight.  You know,  you've got five days to make it clear that you're not declaring  independence.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Yes.  I'm not sure that they were expecting Rajoy to be as strict  and strong as he's Ben right now.  Perhaps what they were thinking about --  who knows what they were thinking about.  It is perhaps they could  renegotiate the independent -- the autonomy statute and the shadow of  possible independence.  And they're just realizing that doesn't work.   That's not working.  At least Rajoy is playing hardball, and it seems to me  that Catalonia is going to lose this battle.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  And just to brief us -- for those who doesn't follow this  as closely as yourself -- the Spanish opposition at the national level is  also in favor of the Rajoy position.  I mean, they may not want such a  hardline position but Rajoy is speaking largely for the entire Spanish body  politic.  </p><p> CABRAL:  That is correct.  And for a significant fraction of Catalonia.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do we actually know?  </p><p> CABRAL:  We don't have the exact numbers my idea is that it's probably  split down the middle, very close to 50/50.  </p><p> QUEST:  Which is a very dangerous area to go into some call for  independence, claiming you have a mandate when 50 percent of the people  actually don't want anything to do with it.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Exactly.  So, there is a majority of people a referendum voted in  favor of independence.  But the turnout was quite low.  And so, there's  probably about 50 percent of Catalonians who are against independence.  At  least in the way that's being prosed right now.  And so, it's a difficult - - and the president -- the leader of Catalonia, in my opinion, is between a  rock and a hard place, because the more extremist Catalonians are pushing  very hard for independence.  But on the other hand, it just realized it  would be tough for him if he were to go ahead with independence right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, professor.  Thank you very much indeed.  Much  appreciated.  Thank you very much.  </p><p> Spain's economy minister will be joining me live on tomorrow night's  program.  Luis de Guindos will be with us at the annual meeting of the lMF  in Washington.  You can see that interview, as well as my debate on the  global economy with the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde.  It is  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tomorrow at this time, live from Washington.  </p><p> So, we need too immediately to our new trading post, and all three -- let  me find -- here we go.  All three of the markets have closed at record.   That means it's the 48th record of the year for the Dow.  The 44th for the  S&amp;P.  And crucially, it is the 56th for the Nasdaq.  One of the reasons --  not only just the news generally -- but one of the reasons for these three  records, the Fed minutes said that there needed to be some patience with  raising rates.  The minutes just came out.  </p><p> Delta Airlines despite the incidents of hurricanes and other delays, Delta  Airlines had earnings better than expected.  So, put this together, and  you've got records on the Dow over 20 -- I mean, 23,000 is looking  extremely touchable and within grasp on the S&amp;P 500 and on the Nasdaq.   You've got nearly 50 records on the Dow.  And no wonder Donald Trump, the  president, has described the market movements as unprecedented.  And the  signs of fear in the market at the moment, absolutely nothing there.  But  remain at 84 on the CNN Money fear and greed index, which is one of extreme  greed.  As you can see, green just about all around the set as we have got  Paul La Monica.  All three are records.  And not just that, good records.   The momentum is there.  There're not eking out these records.  They seem to  want to head there.  </p><p> PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, these are solid gains.   And I think we've talked about this on the show.  Pretty much since the  beginning of the year.  I think a lot of it, despite the President taking  credit for it, is in spite of what's going on in Washington.  Corporate  earnings have been good.  You noted Delta.  We had Blackrock reporting some  good results.  And hopefully Will get decent ones from the big thanks later  this week.  But consumers still spending, corporations still spending.  I'm  just not so sure this is about politics, because, again, as my colleague  Matt Eagan pointed out, we had a lot of records under President Obama, too.   It's not a unique phenomenon -- </p><p> QUEST:  Oh, but 48 in a year.  It's not a -- I mean, we'll need to find  out.  Maybe you could get CNNMoney to see if this is a record so far in  terms of number of records </p><p> LA MONICA:  A record of records.  </p><p> QUEST:  A record of records.  Thank you.  A record of records.  The IMF  meets.  They've warmed about inequality.  </p><p> [16:15:00] Schauble has warned about bubbles and imbalances that exist out  there, as a result of liquidity.  The Fed today suggesting that patience  might be required from the September meeting.  Does that put off a rate  rise to next year?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  I doubt it.  I think that the Fed will probably try and sneak  in one more rate hike in December, as long as earnings remain pretty strong  and the market is doing well.  And, of course, they're looking at  inflation, which is starting to creep up a little bit, because of wage  growth.  We had a very nice jobs report last week with regards to what the  wage growth number was, even though we lost jobs last month.  We did get  nearly 3 percentage wage growth.  And the Fed, I think, is watching that  very closely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, Coach has become tapestry.  And we think that it might have  something to do with this.  Have a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAROL KING, SONGWRITER, RECORDING ARTIST:  Now my tapestry is unraveling. He's come to take me back.   He's come to take me back.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Carol King.</p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, very, very nice.  Very well-played.  I seriously doubt  that that was the motivation.  I did speak to someone at Coach.  As they  now -- they now call it --</p><p> QUEST:  Don't ruin the day.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  -- they now call it tapestry -- they did acknowledge -- it's a  bit of a cutesy name that plays off the whole notion of weaving several  brands into one.  Putting that all aside, this is really similar to what we  had with Alphabet and Google.  There is nothing that people go to that is  Alphabet per se.  You still go to Google.  You go to YouTube.  In the same  way here with Coach, the Coach brand name -- if you like to buy handbag and  wallets from Coach, it's still going to be called Coach.  They're still  going to have Kate Spade, and Sarah Wiseman, the other two brand they  recently acquired.  And I think that's what this signals.  Maybe Coach  wants to do another deal.  And having an umbrella sort of name to house all  of these different brands, that seems to what they're looking to do.  </p><p> QUEST:  I seem to have left my wallet.  Could you lend m, a bit of money --  Paul thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Extraordinary.  More developments as show business -- the world of  show business turns against Harvey Weinstein.  And the allegations are  piling up.  Now the Manhattan District Attorney is defending his decision  not to charge Weinstein with sex crimes.  You're going to hear from him  next.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Straight to Washington, where the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin  Trudeau, is speaking to reporters after meeting with the U.S. President.  </p><p> JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  We know that the success of any  society depends on the full socioeconomic participation of women, because  women succeed, we all succeed.  And whether it's flexible hours, parental  leave, affordable child care, diversity training, equal pay, or any other  number of initiatives.  It's incumbent of us across the public and private  spheres to be proud agents for change.  </p><p> [16:20:08] Following that theme, this morning I had a productive round  table with WomenOne, where we discussed the current barriers to global  gender equality and marked the international day of the girl.  I also met  with the committee on ways and means, and we had a great conversation about  the importance of the Canada/U.S. partnership.  And I just wrapped up a  very good meeting with President Trump, where we talked about trade,  security and economic growth.  As we know, the fourth round of NAFTA  negotiations is under way here in Washington.  And the President and I  reiterated our commitment to in good tired faith to give this deal a much- needed upgrade.  NAFTA has benefited millions of people and can benefit  millions more.  We're pleased to have the opportunity to modernize this  trade agreement for the current economy, a modernization that acknowledges  the importance of gender, the environment and indigenous and labor rights.  </p><p> We know that there are millions of jobs on both sides of the Canada/U.S.  border that rely on trade and investment.  In fact, Canada is among the top  export markets for the majority of U.S. states.  And so, it's imperative  that we get a fair deal for Canadians, Americans and Mexicans alike.   That's what our teams at all orders of government are working hard towards.  </p><p> QUEST:  Justin Trudeau, talking there on NAFTA.  He describes NAFTA as an  upgrade to NAFTA, to modernize it.  We'll get more details on that in the  hours ahead.  Also talking about women and the whole gender question.   Harvey Weinstein comes into all of this, of course.  Harvey Weinstein, the  Hollywood producer, is on his way to rehab.  His wife of ten years has left  him.  The company -- the Weinstein Company is facing an uncertain future.   The claims of sexual misconduct just keep coming.  More women are accusing  the Hollywood producer of rape.  We must stress, Harvey Weinstein denies  those claims.  The indications are the allegations haven't finished.   Amazon is reviewing its projects with the Weinstein Company.  This week his  name was removed from the credits of its shows like \"Project Runway.\"  The  Weinstein Company board has expressed shock and dismay at new allegations  of extreme sexual misconduct and assault.</p><p> An earlier than Manhattan District Attorney explained his decision not to  press charges in the past.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CY VANCE, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  I understand that folks -- folks  are outraged by his behavior.  I understand that there are many other  allegations that have surfaced, but I our case, we really did what I think  the law obligates us to do.  Focus on the evidence and the facts that we  have.  and then I relied on the true professionals to help guide to the  decision, which is not always going to be the popular decision.  That's the  nature of being a prosecutor.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  In the past few minutes, the Academy of Motion Picture and Arts --  basically the Oscars -- say they will hold a special meeting on Saturday  about the Weinstein allegations.  We have Erin Gloria Ryan is here.  Senior  editor for \"The Daily Beast\" and a CNN contributor.  In an op-ed for \"The  Daily Beast\" she defended victims who are reluctant to come forward.  It's  not surprising they're reluctant to come forward, is it?  They are promised  anonymity, or they are promised safe harbor, but the reality is most of  them know that until it becomes a cause celeb like this, they could be  alone, and they could be victimized.  </p><p> ERIN GLORIA RYAN, SENIOR EDITOR, THE DAILY BEAST:  Right.  I think any time  you're a woman who comes forward with this sort of allegation, you've got  someone as powerful as Harvey Weinstein, you're basically setting off an  atomic bomb with yourself at the center -- which I wrote in the piece for  \"The Daily Beast.\"  It's so risky, and it's so unlikely that you're going  to come out of it unscathed by your own career.  </p><p> QUEST:  What is the answer in that situation?  Because you're talking about  a real politic situation, where an individual goes up against a famous or  powerful person.  How does a company adapt then to allow for that?</p><p> RYAN:  I think that brings up a very interesting point.  Because Weinstein  couldn't have done this without all the people that were enabling him along  the way.  There were people who were more powerful than the actresses he is  he was allegedly victimizing who knew about this.  Who didn't say anything.   There were ostensibly film executives who heard about this who didn't do  anything.  There's an entertainment press that in their thirst for access  was willing two just, you know, just push their morals aside in order to  keep these buried.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you think people knew how bad it was or how egregious it was?  </p><p> RYAN:  I don't want to speculate on whether everybody knew every detail of  it.  I think this is the first time we've seen all these, kind of stomach- churning details in one place.  I think the fact that people had indicators  that there might be something that bad there and didn't speak up is pretty  damning to the culture of entertainment as a whole.  </p><p> [16:25:00] QUEST:  But are we in danger -- and I'm choosing my words  carefully and I'm treading delicately.  Are we in danger of turning Harvey  Weinstein into the devil incarnate with all the coverage, and everybody  heaping more opprobrium on top of him?  When the real story is not  Weinstein per se.  It is how it was able to perpetuate.  </p><p> RYAN:  I think it definitely is that.  I think it's also the way that this  -- this isn't just him.  And this isn't just this industry.  When I was  listening to that tape yesterday, there's a tape that the New York Police  Department got in a sting in 2015.  I was listening to that yesterday.   He's trying to coerce a woman into his hotel room.  I related to that tape  so much.  Not because Weinstein ever targeted me.  But because me and every  single woman I know has had a man try to treat us that way in our lives.  </p><p> It's something endemic to American culture.  It's something that's endemic  to different industries.  Media, tech, trucking, service.  This is a  conversation we should be having nationally.  It should be not just about  Weinstein.  Because getting him out of there is not going to fix the  problem.  But we should be doing is teaching men about consent.  And what  we should be doing is teaching men in a position to stand up they need to.  </p><p> QUEST:  So let me ask you, and I ask this as somebody who's got three  sisters and been around this issue most of me adult life -- most of my  life.  What then does need to be done.  To happen, to have that  conversation, to make them?  Because these allegations, in some shape or  form, sexual harassment has been known about by men for a very long time.  </p><p> RYAN:  Yes.  I think that the important thing is for men to take a couple  minutes and be alone and silent with themselves today and consider whether  or not they've ever enabled this sort of behavior.  And how they can  personally not enable it in the future.</p><p> QUEST:  Very grateful you came and talked to us.  Thank you so much indeed.  </p><p> We'll continue tonight.  NAFTA negotiations on round.  We just heard the  Canadian Prime Minister describe it as an upgrade to NAFTA.  The talks are  resuming, and Justin Trudeau turns on the charm at the White House.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  in a moment.  When the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning President  Trump's position on NAFTA is full of poison pills.  And we give Apple,  Google, Amazon and Facebook, an all-access pass into our lives.  A  marketing professor says there is a reason for that.  </p><p> As we continue tonight this is CNN, and on this network, the news always  comes first.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is rejecting Catalonia's call for negotiating  independence from Spain, the prime minister has given the Catalan President  Carles Puigdemont until Monday to clarify whether his vision has declared independence or  not.</p><p> [16:30:00] If the answer is yes, and Puigdemont refuses to reconsider by  the following Thursday, Prime Minister Rajoy says Madrid could then impose  direct rule.</p><p> Firefighters in California are having a tough time, as they battle massive  fires, winds are expected to pick up in the area.  That could threaten to  spread the blaze.  So far, there's no rain in the forecast.  At least 21  people have been killed.  Hundreds more people are missing.  Early  estimates suggest property value damage is more than $65 billion.  </p><p> Multiple sources close to the White House tell CNN that President Trump is  expected to appoint Kirstjen Nielsen as the new U.S. Secretary of Homeland  Security.  The 45-year-old Nielsen would fill the vacancy left by John  Kelly who is now the chief of staff.  She currently works now as a deputy  to Kelly.</p><p> President Trump says he is stronger and tougher on North Korea than his  secretary of state.  Earlier Pyongyang's foreign minister says President  Trump in his words lit the wick of war in his speech at the United Nations  General Assembly.  Mr. Trump put North Korea's leader on notice in that  address, referring to Kim Jong-un as rocket man, in saying that the country  would not survive an American attack.</p><p>Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond says that although the U.K.  economy is fundamentally robust, Brexit is causing a cloud of certainty,  which needs to be cleared.  Hammond told lawmakers the U.K. should prepare  for the worst if no Brexit deal is reached with the E.U.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  PHILIP HAMMOND, FINANCE MINISTER, GREAT BRITAIN:  We also have to consider  the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations, where we have  noncooperation.  Worst-case scenario, even a situation where people are not  necessarily acting in their own economic self-interest.  So, we need to  prepare for a wide range of scenarios.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  The top U.S. business lobby group is warning that NAFTA  negotiations are at risk of complete collapse as the latest round of talks  actually get underway.</p><p> The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau who you heard a moment ago was  at the White House meeting the president, who you heard, has repeatedly  threatened to leave NAFTA.  President Trump said whatever happens, a new  deal has to be fair to all sides.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's possible we won't be  able to make a deal, and it's possible that we will.  We have a great  personal relationship, and we have a relationship now is two countries that  is as close as ever.  But we will see if we can do the changes that we  need.  We have to protect our workers and in all fairness the prime  minister was to protect Canada and his people also/</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  On the eve of the talks that are about to start, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, chief executive Tom Donahue has criticized the Trump  administration for putting what it calls poison pill proposals into the  negotiations.  What are these poison pill various different things?  OK.  </p><p> Here you have, of course, the NAFTA area, Canada, the United States and  Mexico.  And the NAFTA negotiation in round 4, you can hear the poison  pills are rattling around the medicine cabinet.  The first one is the rules  of origin, determining how much of product must be manufactured in north  America to remain duty-free.  For example, the car industry, most at risk,  62 percent if the current rule.</p><p> Trump wants that to be higher and he wants within the rules of origin  specificity so that it's not just one country.  It specifies how much has  to come from the United States, which, of course, would defeat the whole  object of having the single market.  </p><p> Then you have a sunset clause, the U.S. wants NAFTA to expire every five  years until all three countries agree to whatever changes are necessary.   However, business says what's the point of having a NAFTA treaty if every  five years -- I mean let's face it, businesses are making 10, 15, 20-year  decisions, not five-year momentary decisions. So, they say that is not going to work.</p><p> And finally, dispute resolution.  U.S. wants to ditch the neutral  arbitration mechanism.  Put it all together, and you have poison pills that  could scupper, because the others will not agree.  The Mexicans and  Canadians will not agree to these fairly dramatic situations.  </p><p> At any rate to put this into perspective, Paula Newton who was up in Ottawa  with the Canadian position, Clare Sebastian is following the U.S. position.   We'll start with you, Paula, Ms.  Newton, because your prime minister is in  the United States at the moment.  Is Canada prepared for failure of these  talks in the same way that President Trump seemingly is?  </p><p> [16:35:00] PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, and I know  speaking to the Canadian officials behind the scenes that they do not put  it past the president to eventually, because he needs those campaign wins,  most political wins, Richard, to do what he says might do which is  terminate the deal.</p><p> But this is what the Canadians are doing.  Before that meeting with Trump,  Justin Trudeau was on Capitol Hill talking to a very powerful committee  there, the committee that is stacked with Republicans to know how important  Canada is in terms of a trading relationship for their states.  And they  are saying, look.  Number one, Canada is the U.S.'s largest customer, more  trade, the by more than the U.K., China, Japan combined.  In number two,  even if the president signs an executive order, ending NAFTA, it is  Congress that has the final say as to whether that happens.  There might be  some constitutional dispute about that.  We'll wait and see.  But right  now, Congress is saying, we do hold sway here.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is because he's  renegotiating NAFTA at the moment, Richard.  Remember on the campaign trail  and in fact multiple times including this week President Trump has  threatened to rip the whole thing up just do away with it.  In that he can  do unilaterally.  It's called article 2205 and NAFTA, he's allowed to just  make that decision, that would trigger a six-month process where he could  rescind the decision during that six months but he can do it.</p><p> QUEST:  But Clare there is no movement as yet, seemingly they are  negotiating, but these poison pills are destined to scupper because they  are perceived to be not in good faith.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  Those of us with untrained eyes in the area of  trade deals, there is -- doesn't seem to be any way that the three sides  can agree on this.  Mexico is deeply alarmed by the whole rules of origin  thing the U.S. could apply one rule to themselves, one to something else.   Canada is alarmed of getting rid of dispute settlements.  </p><p> QUEST:  Pause there.  Stay with me, Paula.  Justin Trudeau is answering  questions.  Let's have a listen.</p><p> JUSTIN Trudeau, Prime Minister, Canada:  How good NAFTA has been for  millions of citizens of Canada, of the United States and indeed for Mexico.   I know there are opportunities to significantly improve these trade deals  in ways that will benefit citizens right across United States and Canada as  well</p><p> And I truly believe that we can work together in a meaningful way to bring  those benefits to our citizens.  Negotiations are difficult.  Unpredictable  at times but I truly believe that the presidents focused on creating  benefits for his citizens, for the middle class the way we are.  And that  positive trade deals, modernized trade deals, we will get that done.  So  that is something that I continue to focus on.  The conversations we've had  with the way and means committee, the conversations I've had with governors  across the country., the conversations I've had with various leaders of  industry have all emphasized that they see the direct benefits that NAFTA  has brought to their communities, to their economies, and can continue to  bring in the future.  so --</p><p> QUEST:  So, Paula Newton in Ottawa.  Does he believe that?  I mean, you  said to me he's preparing to leave.  Or, no, he's recognizing that that  could be an option.  Nuclear option.  </p><p> [16:40:00] NEWTON:  It is.  But it will be Donald Trump's to trigger or  their decision to walk away from the table.  They need to prepare for those  talks to break down.  You heard him now that isn't much different from what  he said from the last few months.  What is important is what happened in  the last couple hours.  He took the measure of the president and tried to  determine exactly how serious he is, not about terminating NAFTA, but how  serious he is about going back to those poison pills.  What determines a  win for Donald Trump?</p><p> And that's what the prime minister was trying to find out, and we'll know  in the next little while whether he got to that end, and will instruct his  negotiators accordingly.  </p><p> QUEST:  Paula and Clare, thank you.</p><p> Four giants of technology, and they have one goal.  In a moment, the inside  story to the race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Google has had to admit there is a bug in its new home mini  speaker.  Tech bloggers discovered the smart speaker secretly recorded just  about everything it hears Google issued a software update to turn off the  function.  The device expected to go on sale next week.  </p><p> As for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they seem to dominate headlines  and our very lives.  Take the last 48 hour for example.  This is a list of  headlines.  Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping.  Amazon  exploring ways to deliver items inside your home.  Zuckerberg apologizes  for Puerto Rico VR stunt.  </p><p>Apple strikes deal with Spielberg's Amblin.</p><p> As Professor Scott Galloway of marketing at NYU Stern, the author of, \"The  Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google.\"</p><p> Why are they so successful?  Is it because they have basically come up with  something that we find that we actually need?  Admittedly, we didn't know  about it before but that is because it had not been invented.</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR, NYU STERN:  Yes, it runs deeper than  that, Richard.  Google is our modern man' god.  As we become wealthier,  more educated, we're less dependent on a super being, but still he huge  questions.  Used to pray to the gods, will my kid be all right.  Now  symptoms in treatment of croup typed into the Google query box.  When the  six questions have never been asked before that are presented to Google in  the history of mankind.  No coach, Rabbi, priest has that sort of  credibility, Google is our modern God.</p><p>Facebook taps into our need to love and love others through pictures that  reinforce relationships.  Amazon is our consumptive gut.  More for less is  always a strategy that works.  An Apple appeals to our reproductive organs,  Apple is a new symbol of wealth, power, innovation and says you have better  genes to potential mates.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, but at the end of the day, they are doing a good job, they are  doing what they say they will do.  You can't fault them.  And in this  digital age of the Internet economy, they are serving a purpose.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  They do a great job.  And I don't fault them.  I think the  question is, should we as a society ask questions around, do we no longer  worship at the altar of kindness and character but innovation and hold  these companies to different standard than we hold other companies?  </p><p> Your firm, this firm, wasn't weaponized by Russia.  You have checks and  balances in place that cost you a lot of money and reduce your bottom line.   Yet we have decided to Google and Facebook aren't subject to the same  responsibilities as other media companies.</p><p> QUEST:  Is the possibility on that point, on the weaponization, for  example, the weaponization of Facebook, which -- you're concerned about.  </p><p> [16:45:00] That really, it's happened much faster.  it may have taken 40  years for this company to have got size, heft and a certain amount of  influence and power.</p><p> But the speed with which these are, we haven't had time to put in place the  necessary safeguards.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  The technology and innovation has outpaced the public policy or  ability to realm with it.  A lot of people believe that Facebook is not  even sure they know what they fully have right now.</p><p> QUEST:  Let's look at the graphs of share prices which I now is not exactly  a barometer of anything other than people's wealth.  But if you look at,  say, for example, any of them, Apple, Amazon, Google -- here's Apple.   Facebook -- I beg your pardon.  Look at that.  Pretty much solid that  afterwards everybody said, oh lord, this has gone badly.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  So, the combined market capitalization of these four companies  is equivalent to the GDP of India.  Amazon which is paid 1.4 billion in  corporate income tax whereas Walmart has paid 64 billion since the great  recession, it Amazon has added the value of Walmart to its market in the  last 24 months.  We have never seen companies this powerful.  </p><p> QUEST:  So, if you accept, and you have at the beginning of this, that  they're serving a purpose, they're doing it extremely well.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes.  </p><p> QUEST:  And there's a need or we've discovered a need for what they want.   Are you suggesting regulation to impose those forms of safeguards, checks  and balances that a Time Warner has?  Or are you looking at something like  antitrust, break them up?  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  I'm suggesting we hold them to the same standards we hold other  companies and we begin to ask hard questions -- I think we suffer from a  gross idolatry of innovation and youth that has created two-class system,  one for all corporations and one for them.  </p><p> Antitrust, I don't know, if I were on the board of Amazon, I would spin the  AWS prophylactically, because I think that Facebook and Russia situation is  the tipping point, and we're starting to see that the worm has turned.   Whether or not antitrust I don' know.  You know where the war is going to  break out against big tech, Richard, it's going to break out in Europe who  registers all of the downside, the job destruction, tax avoidance of the  big tech companies, but registers very little of the upside.  The war is  going to break out against big tech in Europe.</p><p> QUEST:  Are you on Facebook?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  I am.</p><p> QUEST:  Do you use Amazon?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  I love all of them, I think they are fantastic.</p><p> QUEST:  but with a but dot, dot, dot.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, this is the big question.  What is always good for the  consumer always good for society?  And I think that's the fundamental  question.  </p><p> QUEST:  Glad you came in to talk about.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Thanks so much, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  Thank you, thank you.</p><p> As we continue tonight, tech companies are also disrupting our daily food  chains.

But the delivery of this meal  to the customer in Cairo relies on a billion-dollar company based in Berlin  5000 km away.</p><p> PIETER-JAN VANDEPITTE, COO, DELIVERY HERO:  Delivery Hero is a company  active in online food ordering, we actually grew into a global company with  activities in more than 40 countries.  And we operate almost like what I  called a little bit the United Nations of food delivery with strong  entrepreneurs in the countries.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Customers can order from thousands of restaurants using  the companies app.  Founded in 2011 Delivery Hero is hoping to stay ahead  of newcomers such as Uber Eats and Amazon.</p><p> VANDEPITTE:  In 2016, we had close to 200 million orders.  And we keep on  growing.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The trade-enomics of food delivery is heating up.  The  global food market is worth $9 trillion.  Out of which the food delivery  sector is worth 99 billion.  In terms of the total food market pie, that  represents a mere one percent slice.</p><p> Such huge potential for growth has seen a frenzy of mergers and  acquisitions activity in the last three years as companies invest billions  to gobble up small arrivals.  Customers are hungry for convenience.</p><p> A click and swipe of a app will soon traditional phone calls as the most  convenient way to order.</p><p> In Cairo, the Delivery Hero brand management team collaborate with the  original service.</p><p> To stay ahead of the competition, Delivery Hero exports expertise in tech  and marketing to their regional companies.  </p><p> VANDEPITTE:  It is very important to understand the local ecosystem, and to  really develop the right product and technology for the local customer.  </p><p> [16:50:00] Geolocation is a fundamental part that we need to solve by  understanding the local needs.  And I give you an example of Saudi Arabia,  we don't have street names.  You don't have street numbers.  So, by having  technology to support the delivery boy, the delivery girl, to bring the  food to the customer, we contribute to creating an amazing take away  experience.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> QUEST:  As part of our ongoing commitment to fighting modern day slavery,  Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest tells me why every business needs a  social license.  You will hear him after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Every chief executive has to run their business with a fine moral  code.  That is the view of Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire who  has turned his attention from mining to fighting modern-day slavery.  He  says it's the job of every chief exec to help navigate away, from such  dangers as these.  </p><p> You will be familiar with them from freedom project, human trafficking,  slave labor, sex workers, inherited debt.  When he joined me in the c suite  I asked Andrew Forest why the time has now come for executive moral  leadership.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ANDREW FOREST, FOUNDER, FORTESCUE METALS GROUP:  I think every CEO in the  world has to run their businesses with their own moral code and they must  have a fine moral code.  </p><p> If they don't have a fine moral code, they're not going to be sustainable,  Richard.  That will be found out by consumers.  That will be found out by  the law.  You need to have a right to do business.  You need a social  license to operate these days.  Ten years ago, you didn't.  </p><p> QUEST:  You just said, you need a social license to operate, so you are  accepting that there needs to be a social component, a social  responsibility, in the social leadership for a CEO.</p><p> FORREST:  Yes, Richard.  That's absolutely correct.  I fundamentally  believe that business and particularly chief executives in business, must  set standards they would like to see across society.  Society backs their  business.  They can only produce a profit and loss statement and a decent  balance sheet because of society.  They are responsible to society to act  morally.</p><p> QUEST:  So, let's take for example, in Australia, the marriage equality  battle at the moment, where one of your fellow Australians firmly came out  in favor.  Others have come out against.  It raises and I am genuinely not  trying to take you down into a tricky area.  But it raises the question of  which issues that one goes for.  I can understand modern-day slavery but  let's take the marriage equality.</p><p> FORREST:  No, no, Richard, you go for issues under your control.  You're  not a politician, you're not a person who has to ponder on everything.  </p><p> [16:55:00] What you control, like your labor supply chains, you should be  ready to stand in moral judgment of the quality of labor and freedom of  those laborers.</p><p> Now, if you are saying, which your view on marriage, sex, or whatever it  is, I don't have a view on it, I can't control it.  I'm not going to.  But  if you say to me what about your 3500 suppliers, how do you know there is  not slavery in those supply chains?</p><p> I would have to say to you, Richard, I don't but I'm looking and I am  trying.</p><p> QUEST:  On the question of modern day slavery, the ability to quantify --  we all know it is going on.  We all know it is at a horrific level.  But  the ability to provide verifiable statistics.  How significant is that?</p><p> FORREST:  I think it is very, very significant, I found out yesterday how  significant that was, when the ILO and walk free index published a common  number, not only were we shared on the table by your own Ivanka Trump who  was committing the United States to fight slavery around the world.  But  the other end of the table introducing us for the Secretary-General of the  United Nations, the Prime Minister of Britain, in lined up by the side was  state leaders from all over the world.  And their committing to slavery.   And why are they committing?  Because you now can measure in their  countries.</p><p> QUEST:  They are committing but I've got a word for you, results.</p><p> FORREST:  Thanks, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  I will say it again, results, they have gotten now actually do  something.  Results.</p><p> FORREST:  And that is why we need CNN to hold them to account, that's why  your role in your support against moderate slavery is critical because your  analysis drives results.  Transparency, measurement and media drives  results.</p><p> QUEST:  We'll hold you to account.  </p><p> FORREST:  Oh, you do, sir.</p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you.  </p><p> FORREST:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Spirited debate in the C-suite.  We'll have a Profitable Moment  after the break.  This is CNN.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  It's worth looking ahead to tomorrow  night's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS which comes from the IMF, International  Monetary Fund's annual meetings.  </p><p> Tomorrow night we will have the debate it will be between Christine  Lagarde, the French finance minister, the Indonesians, the Canadian finance  minister.  And hear what they say on the issues of austerity, what they say  about inequality, how they believe that the bubbles and inequalities and  imbalances in the economies at the moment could be dealt with in the  future.</p><p> QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from the IMF live tomorrow night.</p><p> Otherwise, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight from New York.  I'm  Richard Quest.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's  profitable.  I'll see you in Washington tomorrow!</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on  Wall Street.  Dow Jones at a record again, of .2 of 1 percent.  Nasdaq also  at a record high.  We'll bring you that in the trading post.  Otherwise,  sir, do the honors.  I declare that to be a firm gavel on Wednesday,  October the 11th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Walking away from Catalonia the president tells CNN, he want talks with  Madrid, as businesses are abandoning the Spanish region.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Walking away from NAFTA, President Trump is threatening to leave the deal,  as a new round of negotiations begin, the President's been meeting the  Canadian Prime Minister.  </p><p> And walking away from Weinstein.  The film company's partners consider  cancelling their various deals.  </p><p> I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where, of course, I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  Tonight, five days that will decide the future of Catalonia  and indeed the cohesion of Spain.  The country's Prime Minister Mariano  Rajoy has given the Catalonian president until Monday to clarify if he's  declared independence or not.  With the IMF already warning contagion, his  answers whether this crisis is settled by dialogue or something more  dramatic.  </p><p> Both sides are now playing the waiting game.  Let me show you exactly how  this plays out.  If you take Spain, Madrid in the center, Barcelona on the  eastern coast.  Madrid and Catalonia are retreating behind their respective  red lines, a negotiating strategy.  And they're waiting to see if either of  the other side crosses the red line.  </p><p> So, let's take the Madrid side first.  If you look at Madrid, the Prime  Minister Rajoy has refused to hold talks unless the independence claim is  dropped.  And he's warning that Catalonia will do great damage to itself  and to business if it goes ahead with its independence.  Today he said the  crisis has already done more to hurt Catalan tourism than terror attacks in  Barcelona.  It's significantly -- Mariano Rajoy, the Prime Minister,  bearing in mind what the Catalan President did yesterday, the prime  minister says the next move is up to Catalonia.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARIANO RAJOY, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  It is the  answer that Mr. Puigdemont will give to this issue that will mark the  future of what's going to happen next.  It is within his power to go back  to legality, and to institutional normality or to continue with an  instability period without perhaps losing Catalonia.  We are living one of  the worst moments in the recent history of democracy.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Now, in his back pocket the prime minister always has the nuclear  option of Article 155 of, the Spanish constitution that would allow him to  basically impose direct rule once again on Catalonia.  If he were to do  that, well, on the other side, you have the red line from the Catalan  President, who is insisting on talks without preconditions.  Catalonia's  economy does give him some leverage.  It makes up about 20 percent of  Spanish GDP and pays much more into the tax system of Madrid and Spain than  it does get back from the country.  In an exclusive interview with CNN, the  Catalan President said it was time for proper talks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLES PUIGDEMONT, CATALAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I believe that  today we find ourselves in a moment of most importance.  That we have no  prior conditions to sit down and talk.  Except that we must dialogue, and  we must dialogue within adequate conditions.  Maybe it could help dialogue  if two people from the Catalan government and two people from the Spanish  government simply agreed on one simple thing.  Appointing a mediator, for  instance.  But we cannot ignore the fact that talks apathetical discussions  need to come from recognizing reality.  </p><p> And that is what we need to talk about.  The relationship Catalonia, Spain,  it does not work and there is majority of Catalan people that want to make  Catalonia an independent state.  And want to do that in agreement with the  Spanish state.  But we need to do that without conditions.  We need to sit  down and really talk.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [16:05:00] QUEST:  Spanish investors are treating this entire incident with  a certain amount of trepidation and caution.  Let's just take today.  The  evidence for this is the way Spanish stocks rebound, from Tuesday's losses,  and outperformed the rest of Europe.  But really, at 1.3 percent gain in  the IBEX has to be seen the fall of the previous day, and almost certain  knowledge that if there was to be detrimental move tomorrow, that market  would turn down.  The cost of buying Spanish debt, which rises bond to its  lowest level of the month so far.  Again, the ten-year bond, this would  have to be seen in the context of an independence declaration or a  worsening situation that would send the bond higher, almost certainly.   Atika Shubert is live for us in Barcelona tonight.  This level of  uncertainty, Atika, these five days that the Prime Minister has given the  Catalonia President.  It's very tense.  </p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  absolutely.  I  mean, he's really turning the screws on Catalan President Puigdemont.  I  mean basically by asking him to clarify whether or not it was a declaration  of independence.  He's really trying to split, as well, the independence  movement.  Remember, it is fractured parliament here and Puigdemont is  really sitting on a coalition of many different interests.  </p><p> If he says for example, that no, it was only a symbolic declaration, then  he could find that he doesn't have the support from those much more  hardline separatists.  If he says, you know -- if he says it is declaration  of independence, well, that would be upping the stakes dramatically, a give  Rajoy a reason -- the Prime Minister a reason to come in and take over the  regional government.  So, he is really turning the screws on the Catalan  President.  How he's going to respond in the next few days is what we're  watching for.  </p><p> QUEST:  OK.  The idea of mediation, the idea of talks, would be what?   Talks about greater autonomy?  I mean, listening to that interview, with  Nic Robertson, where he talks about, you know, we have a right to  independence.  Well, even if you have temporary talks, talks to what?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  You know, the independence movement here goes back hundreds of  years really, it has deep historical roots.  But the most recent change  here happened in 2006, when there was autonomy statute that Catalan had  passed, and that was accepted by the Spanish government.  Then in 2010, the  constitutional, court struck that down.  And ever since independence then  the independence movement has been re-sparked.  It was basically revived  under that.  </p><p> So, if there were any talks to take place, it would be about this autonomy  statute.  What kind of an autonomy would Catalonia need?  What more would  they need?  Financial independence.  What else do they want?  And so, I  think that's what the talks in itself would be about.  But, you know, these  -- this idea that there will be no preconditions is something that the  Prime Minister says is absolutely a no go.  He Will not have any dialogue,  he says, until it's clear that there has not been a declaration of  independence.  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Barcelona.  Atika, thank you.  Let's talk to  Professor Luis Cabral of the International Business, NYU Stern.  Good to  see you Professor.  </p><p> LUIS CABRAL, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, NYU STERN:  Good to see  you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Where is the pressure coming from here?  There's the political  pressure in one since, but how significant is the business pressure?   Whether it's the Caixa Bank moving out, the other banks, the other  companies taking advantage.  Where does commerce come into it?  </p><p> CABRAL:  The biggest pressure is the large banks and large corporations  that are headquartered in Barcelona, and that are thinking very seriously  about moving to Madrid.  Because if there is independence or even if there  is a situation of uncertainty continues the way it is now, it's not good  business to be in Barcelona for them.  And that can have a huge negative  impact on the Catalonia economy.  In fact, that's already been happening  for a number of years, by the way, because of the language laws in  Catalonia.  So, this would only accelerate that movement.  </p><p> QUEST:  One assumes that the Catalonian government does not wish to commit  financial suicide, or at least economic suicide.  Now, similar arguments  with Scotland.  If they vote for independence, they leave the European  Union.  </p><p> CABRAL:  That's true.  And as of now, it's not clear what would happen to  Catalonia if there were to become independent.  You would need all of the  European Union countries to vote in favor of them becoming members of the  European Union.  And it's far from obvious that would be the case.  </p><p> QUEST:  Well, Spain certainly wouldn't and the United Kingdom wouldn't.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Probably not.  </p><p> QUEST:  Assuming the U.K. is still there, of course.</p><p> CABRAL:  That is correct.  And so, that's part of the potential cost of  independence.  Now, of course, it's not very credible to say that we will  never talk to you again.  And I think some sort of a deal agreement,  possibly even membership, would eventually be achieved, in my opinion.  </p><p> [16:10:00] QUEST:  But what do they want -- I mean, you heard me ask Atika  Shubert this.  When Catalonia suspends its declaration of independence, and  there's more talks or mediation, the two are diametrically opposed.  The  Prime Minister cannot give ground -- he said this tonight.  You know,  you've got five days to make it clear that you're not declaring  independence.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Yes.  I'm not sure that they were expecting Rajoy to be as strict  and strong as he's Ben right now.  Perhaps what they were thinking about --  who knows what they were thinking about.  It is perhaps they could  renegotiate the independent -- the autonomy statute and the shadow of  possible independence.  And they're just realizing that doesn't work.   That's not working.  At least Rajoy is playing hardball, and it seems to me  that Catalonia is going to lose this battle.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  And just to brief us -- for those who doesn't follow this  as closely as yourself -- the Spanish opposition at the national level is  also in favor of the Rajoy position.  I mean, they may not want such a  hardline position but Rajoy is speaking largely for the entire Spanish body  politic.  </p><p> CABRAL:  That is correct.  And for a significant fraction of Catalonia.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do we actually know?  </p><p> CABRAL:  We don't have the exact numbers my idea is that it's probably  split down the middle, very close to 50/50.  </p><p> QUEST:  Which is a very dangerous area to go into some call for  independence, claiming you have a mandate when 50 percent of the people  actually don't want anything to do with it.  </p><p> CABRAL:  Exactly.  So, there is a majority of people a referendum voted in  favor of independence.  But the turnout was quite low.  And so, there's  probably about 50 percent of Catalonians who are against independence.  At  least in the way that's being prosed right now.  And so, it's a difficult - - and the president -- the leader of Catalonia, in my opinion, is between a  rock and a hard place, because the more extremist Catalonians are pushing  very hard for independence.  But on the other hand, it just realized it  would be tough for him if he were to go ahead with independence right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, professor.  Thank you very much indeed.  Much  appreciated.  Thank you very much.  </p><p> Spain's economy minister will be joining me live on tomorrow night's  program.  Luis de Guindos will be with us at the annual meeting of the lMF  in Washington.  You can see that interview, as well as my debate on the  global economy with the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde.  It is  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tomorrow at this time, live from Washington.  </p><p> So, we need too immediately to our new trading post, and all three -- let  me find -- here we go.  All three of the markets have closed at record.   That means it's the 48th record of the year for the Dow.  The 44th for the  S&amp;P.  And crucially, it is the 56th for the Nasdaq.  One of the reasons --  not only just the news generally -- but one of the reasons for these three  records, the Fed minutes said that there needed to be some patience with  raising rates.  The minutes just came out.  </p><p> Delta Airlines despite the incidents of hurricanes and other delays, Delta  Airlines had earnings better than expected.  So, put this together, and  you've got records on the Dow over 20 -- I mean, 23,000 is looking  extremely touchable and within grasp on the S&amp;P 500 and on the Nasdaq.   You've got nearly 50 records on the Dow.  And no wonder Donald Trump, the  president, has described the market movements as unprecedented.  And the  signs of fear in the market at the moment, absolutely nothing there.  But  remain at 84 on the CNN Money fear and greed index, which is one of extreme  greed.  As you can see, green just about all around the set as we have got  Paul La Monica.  All three are records.  And not just that, good records.   The momentum is there.  There're not eking out these records.  They seem to  want to head there.  </p><p> PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, these are solid gains.   And I think we've talked about this on the show.  Pretty much since the  beginning of the year.  I think a lot of it, despite the President taking  credit for it, is in spite of what's going on in Washington.  Corporate  earnings have been good.  You noted Delta.  We had Blackrock reporting some  good results.  And hopefully Will get decent ones from the big thanks later  this week.  But consumers still spending, corporations still spending.  I'm  just not so sure this is about politics, because, again, as my colleague  Matt Eagan pointed out, we had a lot of records under President Obama, too.   It's not a unique phenomenon -- </p><p> QUEST:  Oh, but 48 in a year.  It's not a -- I mean, we'll need to find  out.  Maybe you could get CNNMoney to see if this is a record so far in  terms of number of records </p><p> LA MONICA:  A record of records.  </p><p> QUEST:  A record of records.  Thank you.  A record of records.  The IMF  meets.  They've warmed about inequality.  </p><p> [16:15:00] Schauble has warned about bubbles and imbalances that exist out  there, as a result of liquidity.  The Fed today suggesting that patience  might be required from the September meeting.  Does that put off a rate  rise to next year?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  I doubt it.  I think that the Fed will probably try and sneak  in one more rate hike in December, as long as earnings remain pretty strong  and the market is doing well.  And, of course, they're looking at  inflation, which is starting to creep up a little bit, because of wage  growth.  We had a very nice jobs report last week with regards to what the  wage growth number was, even though we lost jobs last month.  We did get  nearly 3 percentage wage growth.  And the Fed, I think, is watching that  very closely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, Coach has become tapestry.  And we think that it might have  something to do with this.  Have a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAROL KING, SONGWRITER, RECORDING ARTIST:  Now my tapestry is unraveling. He's come to take me back.   He's come to take me back.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Carol King.</p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, very, very nice.  Very well-played.  I seriously doubt  that that was the motivation.  I did speak to someone at Coach.  As they  now -- they now call it --</p><p> QUEST:  Don't ruin the day.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  -- they now call it tapestry -- they did acknowledge -- it's a  bit of a cutesy name that plays off the whole notion of weaving several  brands into one.  Putting that all aside, this is really similar to what we  had with Alphabet and Google.  There is nothing that people go to that is  Alphabet per se.  You still go to Google.  You go to YouTube.  In the same  way here with Coach, the Coach brand name -- if you like to buy handbag and  wallets from Coach, it's still going to be called Coach.  They're still  going to have Kate Spade, and Sarah Wiseman, the other two brand they  recently acquired.  And I think that's what this signals.  Maybe Coach  wants to do another deal.  And having an umbrella sort of name to house all  of these different brands, that seems to what they're looking to do.  </p><p> QUEST:  I seem to have left my wallet.  Could you lend m, a bit of money --  Paul thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  Extraordinary.  More developments as show business -- the world of  show business turns against Harvey Weinstein.  And the allegations are  piling up.  Now the Manhattan District Attorney is defending his decision  not to charge Weinstein with sex crimes.  You're going to hear from him  next.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Straight to Washington, where the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin  Trudeau, is speaking to reporters after meeting with the U.S. President.  </p><p> JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  We know that the success of any  society depends on the full socioeconomic participation of women, because  women succeed, we all succeed.  And whether it's flexible hours, parental  leave, affordable child care, diversity training, equal pay, or any other  number of initiatives.  It's incumbent of us across the public and private  spheres to be proud agents for change.  </p><p> [16:20:08] Following that theme, this morning I had a productive round  table with WomenOne, where we discussed the current barriers to global  gender equality and marked the international day of the girl.  I also met  with the committee on ways and means, and we had a great conversation about  the importance of the Canada/U.S. partnership.  And I just wrapped up a  very good meeting with President Trump, where we talked about trade,  security and economic growth.  As we know, the fourth round of NAFTA  negotiations is under way here in Washington.  And the President and I  reiterated our commitment to in good tired faith to give this deal a much- needed upgrade.  NAFTA has benefited millions of people and can benefit  millions more.  We're pleased to have the opportunity to modernize this  trade agreement for the current economy, a modernization that acknowledges  the importance of gender, the environment and indigenous and labor rights.  </p><p> We know that there are millions of jobs on both sides of the Canada/U.S.  border that rely on trade and investment.  In fact, Canada is among the top  export markets for the majority of U.S. states.  And so, it's imperative  that we get a fair deal for Canadians, Americans and Mexicans alike.   That's what our teams at all orders of government are working hard towards.  </p><p> QUEST:  Justin Trudeau, talking there on NAFTA.  He describes NAFTA as an  upgrade to NAFTA, to modernize it.  We'll get more details on that in the  hours ahead.  Also talking about women and the whole gender question.   Harvey Weinstein comes into all of this, of course.  Harvey Weinstein, the  Hollywood producer, is on his way to rehab.  His wife of ten years has left  him.  The company -- the Weinstein Company is facing an uncertain future.   The claims of sexual misconduct just keep coming.  More women are accusing  the Hollywood producer of rape.  We must stress, Harvey Weinstein denies  those claims.  The indications are the allegations haven't finished.   Amazon is reviewing its projects with the Weinstein Company.  This week his  name was removed from the credits of its shows like \"Project Runway.\"  The  Weinstein Company board has expressed shock and dismay at new allegations  of extreme sexual misconduct and assault.</p><p> An earlier than Manhattan District Attorney explained his decision not to  press charges in the past.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CY VANCE, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  I understand that folks -- folks  are outraged by his behavior.  I understand that there are many other  allegations that have surfaced, but I our case, we really did what I think  the law obligates us to do.  Focus on the evidence and the facts that we  have.  and then I relied on the true professionals to help guide to the  decision, which is not always going to be the popular decision.  That's the  nature of being a prosecutor.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  In the past few minutes, the Academy of Motion Picture and Arts --  basically the Oscars -- say they will hold a special meeting on Saturday  about the Weinstein allegations.  We have Erin Gloria Ryan is here.  Senior  editor for \"The Daily Beast\" and a CNN contributor.  In an op-ed for \"The  Daily Beast\" she defended victims who are reluctant to come forward.  It's  not surprising they're reluctant to come forward, is it?  They are promised  anonymity, or they are promised safe harbor, but the reality is most of  them know that until it becomes a cause celeb like this, they could be  alone, and they could be victimized.  </p><p> ERIN GLORIA RYAN, SENIOR EDITOR, THE DAILY BEAST:  Right.  I think any time  you're a woman who comes forward with this sort of allegation, you've got  someone as powerful as Harvey Weinstein, you're basically setting off an  atomic bomb with yourself at the center -- which I wrote in the piece for  \"The Daily Beast.\"  It's so risky, and it's so unlikely that you're going  to come out of it unscathed by your own career.  </p><p> QUEST:  What is the answer in that situation?  Because you're talking about  a real politic situation, where an individual goes up against a famous or  powerful person.  How does a company adapt then to allow for that?</p><p> RYAN:  I think that brings up a very interesting point.  Because Weinstein  couldn't have done this without all the people that were enabling him along  the way.  There were people who were more powerful than the actresses he is  he was allegedly victimizing who knew about this.  Who didn't say anything.   There were ostensibly film executives who heard about this who didn't do  anything.  There's an entertainment press that in their thirst for access  was willing two just, you know, just push their morals aside in order to  keep these buried.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you think people knew how bad it was or how egregious it was?  </p><p> RYAN:  I don't want to speculate on whether everybody knew every detail of  it.  I think this is the first time we've seen all these, kind of stomach- churning details in one place.  I think the fact that people had indicators  that there might be something that bad there and didn't speak up is pretty  damning to the culture of entertainment as a whole.  </p><p> [16:25:00] QUEST:  But are we in danger -- and I'm choosing my words  carefully and I'm treading delicately.  Are we in danger of turning Harvey  Weinstein into the devil incarnate with all the coverage, and everybody  heaping more opprobrium on top of him?  When the real story is not  Weinstein per se.  It is how it was able to perpetuate.  </p><p> RYAN:  I think it definitely is that.  I think it's also the way that this  -- this isn't just him.  And this isn't just this industry.  When I was  listening to that tape yesterday, there's a tape that the New York Police  Department got in a sting in 2015.  I was listening to that yesterday.   He's trying to coerce a woman into his hotel room.  I related to that tape  so much.  Not because Weinstein ever targeted me.  But because me and every  single woman I know has had a man try to treat us that way in our lives.  </p><p> It's something endemic to American culture.  It's something that's endemic  to different industries.  Media, tech, trucking, service.  This is a  conversation we should be having nationally.  It should be not just about  Weinstein.  Because getting him out of there is not going to fix the  problem.  But we should be doing is teaching men about consent.  And what  we should be doing is teaching men in a position to stand up they need to.  </p><p> QUEST:  So let me ask you, and I ask this as somebody who's got three  sisters and been around this issue most of me adult life -- most of my  life.  What then does need to be done.  To happen, to have that  conversation, to make them?  Because these allegations, in some shape or  form, sexual harassment has been known about by men for a very long time.  </p><p> RYAN:  Yes.  I think that the important thing is for men to take a couple  minutes and be alone and silent with themselves today and consider whether  or not they've ever enabled this sort of behavior.  And how they can  personally not enable it in the future.</p><p> QUEST:  Very grateful you came and talked to us.  Thank you so much indeed.  </p><p> We'll continue tonight.  NAFTA negotiations on round.  We just heard the  Canadian Prime Minister describe it as an upgrade to NAFTA.  The talks are  resuming, and Justin Trudeau turns on the charm at the White House.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  in a moment.  When the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning President  Trump's position on NAFTA is full of poison pills.  And we give Apple,  Google, Amazon and Facebook, an all-access pass into our lives.  A  marketing professor says there is a reason for that.  </p><p> As we continue tonight this is CNN, and on this network, the news always  comes first.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is rejecting Catalonia's call for negotiating  independence from Spain, the prime minister has given the Catalan President  Carles Puigdemont until Monday to clarify whether his vision has declared independence or  not.</p><p> [16:30:00] If the answer is yes, and Puigdemont refuses to reconsider by  the following Thursday, Prime Minister Rajoy says Madrid could then impose  direct rule.</p><p> Firefighters in California are having a tough time, as they battle massive  fires, winds are expected to pick up in the area.  That could threaten to  spread the blaze.  So far, there's no rain in the forecast.  At least 21  people have been killed.  Hundreds more people are missing.  Early  estimates suggest property value damage is more than $65 billion.  </p><p> Multiple sources close to the White House tell CNN that President Trump is  expected to appoint Kirstjen Nielsen as the new U.S. Secretary of Homeland  Security.  The 45-year-old Nielsen would fill the vacancy left by John  Kelly who is now the chief of staff.  She currently works now as a deputy  to Kelly.</p><p> President Trump says he is stronger and tougher on North Korea than his  secretary of state.  Earlier Pyongyang's foreign minister says President  Trump in his words lit the wick of war in his speech at the United Nations  General Assembly.  Mr. Trump put North Korea's leader on notice in that  address, referring to Kim Jong-un as rocket man, in saying that the country  would not survive an American attack.</p><p>Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond says that although the U.K.  economy is fundamentally robust, Brexit is causing a cloud of certainty,  which needs to be cleared.  Hammond told lawmakers the U.K. should prepare  for the worst if no Brexit deal is reached with the E.U.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  PHILIP HAMMOND, FINANCE MINISTER, GREAT BRITAIN:  We also have to consider  the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations, where we have  noncooperation.  Worst-case scenario, even a situation where people are not  necessarily acting in their own economic self-interest.  So, we need to  prepare for a wide range of scenarios.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  The top U.S. business lobby group is warning that NAFTA  negotiations are at risk of complete collapse as the latest round of talks  actually get underway.</p><p> The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau who you heard a moment ago was  at the White House meeting the president, who you heard, has repeatedly  threatened to leave NAFTA.  President Trump said whatever happens, a new  deal has to be fair to all sides.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's possible we won't be  able to make a deal, and it's possible that we will.  We have a great  personal relationship, and we have a relationship now is two countries that  is as close as ever.  But we will see if we can do the changes that we  need.  We have to protect our workers and in all fairness the prime  minister was to protect Canada and his people also/</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  On the eve of the talks that are about to start, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, chief executive Tom Donahue has criticized the Trump  administration for putting what it calls poison pill proposals into the  negotiations.  What are these poison pill various different things?  OK.  </p><p> Here you have, of course, the NAFTA area, Canada, the United States and  Mexico.  And the NAFTA negotiation in round 4, you can hear the poison  pills are rattling around the medicine cabinet.  The first one is the rules  of origin, determining how much of product must be manufactured in north  America to remain duty-free.  For example, the car industry, most at risk,  62 percent if the current rule.</p><p> Trump wants that to be higher and he wants within the rules of origin  specificity so that it's not just one country.  It specifies how much has  to come from the United States, which, of course, would defeat the whole  object of having the single market.  </p><p> Then you have a sunset clause, the U.S. wants NAFTA to expire every five  years until all three countries agree to whatever changes are necessary.   However, business says what's the point of having a NAFTA treaty if every  five years -- I mean let's face it, businesses are making 10, 15, 20-year  decisions, not five-year momentary decisions. So, they say that is not going to work.</p><p> And finally, dispute resolution.  U.S. wants to ditch the neutral  arbitration mechanism.  Put it all together, and you have poison pills that  could scupper, because the others will not agree.  The Mexicans and  Canadians will not agree to these fairly dramatic situations.  </p><p> At any rate to put this into perspective, Paula Newton who was up in Ottawa  with the Canadian position, Clare Sebastian is following the U.S. position.   We'll start with you, Paula, Ms.  Newton, because your prime minister is in  the United States at the moment.  Is Canada prepared for failure of these  talks in the same way that President Trump seemingly is?  </p><p> [16:35:00] PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, and I know  speaking to the Canadian officials behind the scenes that they do not put  it past the president to eventually, because he needs those campaign wins,  most political wins, Richard, to do what he says might do which is  terminate the deal.</p><p> But this is what the Canadians are doing.  Before that meeting with Trump,  Justin Trudeau was on Capitol Hill talking to a very powerful committee  there, the committee that is stacked with Republicans to know how important  Canada is in terms of a trading relationship for their states.  And they  are saying, look.  Number one, Canada is the U.S.'s largest customer, more  trade, the by more than the U.K., China, Japan combined.  In number two,  even if the president signs an executive order, ending NAFTA, it is  Congress that has the final say as to whether that happens.  There might be  some constitutional dispute about that.  We'll wait and see.  But right  now, Congress is saying, we do hold sway here.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is because he's  renegotiating NAFTA at the moment, Richard.  Remember on the campaign trail  and in fact multiple times including this week President Trump has  threatened to rip the whole thing up just do away with it.  In that he can  do unilaterally.  It's called article 2205 and NAFTA, he's allowed to just  make that decision, that would trigger a six-month process where he could  rescind the decision during that six months but he can do it.</p><p> QUEST:  But Clare there is no movement as yet, seemingly they are  negotiating, but these poison pills are destined to scupper because they  are perceived to be not in good faith.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  Those of us with untrained eyes in the area of  trade deals, there is -- doesn't seem to be any way that the three sides  can agree on this.  Mexico is deeply alarmed by the whole rules of origin  thing the U.S. could apply one rule to themselves, one to something else.   Canada is alarmed of getting rid of dispute settlements.  </p><p> QUEST:  Pause there.  Stay with me, Paula.  Justin Trudeau is answering  questions.  Let's have a listen.</p><p> JUSTIN Trudeau, Prime Minister, Canada:  How good NAFTA has been for  millions of citizens of Canada, of the United States and indeed for Mexico.   I know there are opportunities to significantly improve these trade deals  in ways that will benefit citizens right across United States and Canada as  well</p><p> And I truly believe that we can work together in a meaningful way to bring  those benefits to our citizens.  Negotiations are difficult.  Unpredictable  at times but I truly believe that the presidents focused on creating  benefits for his citizens, for the middle class the way we are.  And that  positive trade deals, modernized trade deals, we will get that done.  So  that is something that I continue to focus on.  The conversations we've had  with the way and means committee, the conversations I've had with governors  across the country., the conversations I've had with various leaders of  industry have all emphasized that they see the direct benefits that NAFTA  has brought to their communities, to their economies, and can continue to  bring in the future.  so --</p><p> QUEST:  So, Paula Newton in Ottawa.  Does he believe that?  I mean, you  said to me he's preparing to leave.  Or, no, he's recognizing that that  could be an option.  Nuclear option.  </p><p> [16:40:00] NEWTON:  It is.  But it will be Donald Trump's to trigger or  their decision to walk away from the table.  They need to prepare for those  talks to break down.  You heard him now that isn't much different from what  he said from the last few months.  What is important is what happened in  the last couple hours.  He took the measure of the president and tried to  determine exactly how serious he is, not about terminating NAFTA, but how  serious he is about going back to those poison pills.  What determines a  win for Donald Trump?</p><p> And that's what the prime minister was trying to find out, and we'll know  in the next little while whether he got to that end, and will instruct his  negotiators accordingly.  </p><p> QUEST:  Paula and Clare, thank you.</p><p> Four giants of technology, and they have one goal.  In a moment, the inside  story to the race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Google has had to admit there is a bug in its new home mini  speaker.  Tech bloggers discovered the smart speaker secretly recorded just  about everything it hears Google issued a software update to turn off the  function.  The device expected to go on sale next week.  </p><p> As for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they seem to dominate headlines  and our very lives.  Take the last 48 hour for example.  This is a list of  headlines.  Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping.  Amazon  exploring ways to deliver items inside your home.  Zuckerberg apologizes  for Puerto Rico VR stunt.  </p><p>Apple strikes deal with Spielberg's Amblin.</p><p> As Professor Scott Galloway of marketing at NYU Stern, the author of, \"The  Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google.\"</p><p> Why are they so successful?  Is it because they have basically come up with  something that we find that we actually need?  Admittedly, we didn't know  about it before but that is because it had not been invented.</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR, NYU STERN:  Yes, it runs deeper than  that, Richard.  Google is our modern man' god.  As we become wealthier,  more educated, we're less dependent on a super being, but still he huge  questions.  Used to pray to the gods, will my kid be all right.  Now  symptoms in treatment of croup typed into the Google query box.  When the  six questions have never been asked before that are presented to Google in  the history of mankind.  No coach, Rabbi, priest has that sort of  credibility, Google is our modern God.</p><p>Facebook taps into our need to love and love others through pictures that  reinforce relationships.  Amazon is our consumptive gut.  More for less is  always a strategy that works.  An Apple appeals to our reproductive organs,  Apple is a new symbol of wealth, power, innovation and says you have better  genes to potential mates.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, but at the end of the day, they are doing a good job, they are  doing what they say they will do.  You can't fault them.  And in this  digital age of the Internet economy, they are serving a purpose.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  They do a great job.  And I don't fault them.  I think the  question is, should we as a society ask questions around, do we no longer  worship at the altar of kindness and character but innovation and hold  these companies to different standard than we hold other companies?  </p><p> Your firm, this firm, wasn't weaponized by Russia.  You have checks and  balances in place that cost you a lot of money and reduce your bottom line.   Yet we have decided to Google and Facebook aren't subject to the same  responsibilities as other media companies.</p><p> QUEST:  Is the possibility on that point, on the weaponization, for  example, the weaponization of Facebook, which -- you're concerned about.  </p><p> [16:45:00] That really, it's happened much faster.  it may have taken 40  years for this company to have got size, heft and a certain amount of  influence and power.</p><p> But the speed with which these are, we haven't had time to put in place the  necessary safeguards.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  The technology and innovation has outpaced the public policy or  ability to realm with it.  A lot of people believe that Facebook is not  even sure they know what they fully have right now.</p><p> QUEST:  Let's look at the graphs of share prices which I now is not exactly  a barometer of anything other than people's wealth.  But if you look at,  say, for example, any of them, Apple, Amazon, Google -- here's Apple.   Facebook -- I beg your pardon.  Look at that.  Pretty much solid that  afterwards everybody said, oh lord, this has gone badly.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  So, the combined market capitalization of these four companies  is equivalent to the GDP of India.  Amazon which is paid 1.4 billion in  corporate income tax whereas Walmart has paid 64 billion since the great  recession, it Amazon has added the value of Walmart to its market in the  last 24 months.  We have never seen companies this powerful.  </p><p> QUEST:  So, if you accept, and you have at the beginning of this, that  they're serving a purpose, they're doing it extremely well.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes.  </p><p> QUEST:  And there's a need or we've discovered a need for what they want.   Are you suggesting regulation to impose those forms of safeguards, checks  and balances that a Time Warner has?  Or are you looking at something like  antitrust, break them up?  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  I'm suggesting we hold them to the same standards we hold other  companies and we begin to ask hard questions -- I think we suffer from a  gross idolatry of innovation and youth that has created two-class system,  one for all corporations and one for them.  </p><p> Antitrust, I don't know, if I were on the board of Amazon, I would spin the  AWS prophylactically, because I think that Facebook and Russia situation is  the tipping point, and we're starting to see that the worm has turned.   Whether or not antitrust I don' know.  You know where the war is going to  break out against big tech, Richard, it's going to break out in Europe who  registers all of the downside, the job destruction, tax avoidance of the  big tech companies, but registers very little of the upside.  The war is  going to break out against big tech in Europe.</p><p> QUEST:  Are you on Facebook?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  I am.</p><p> QUEST:  Do you use Amazon?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  I love all of them, I think they are fantastic.</p><p> QUEST:  but with a but dot, dot, dot.  </p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, this is the big question.  What is always good for the  consumer always good for society?  And I think that's the fundamental  question.  </p><p> QUEST:  Glad you came in to talk about.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Thanks so much, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  Thank you, thank you.</p><p> As we continue tonight, tech companies are also disrupting our daily food  chains.  The Traders series now as we meet one company which is  capitalizing on our appetite for convenience.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A pang of hunger in Egypt starts a chain reaction which  crosses continents.  Cairo restaurant Al Dia prepares the dish.  </p><p> And in under 30 minutes it is ready to eat.  But the delivery of this meal  to the customer in Cairo relies on a billion-dollar company based in Berlin  5000 km away.</p><p> PIETER-JAN VANDEPITTE, COO, DELIVERY HERO:  Delivery Hero is a company  active in online food ordering, we actually grew into a global company with  activities in more than 40 countries.  And we operate almost like what I  called a little bit the United Nations of food delivery with strong  entrepreneurs in the countries.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Customers can order from thousands of restaurants using  the companies app.  Founded in 2011 Delivery Hero is hoping to stay ahead  of newcomers such as Uber Eats and Amazon.</p><p> VANDEPITTE:  In 2016, we had close to 200 million orders.  And we keep on  growing.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The trade-enomics of food delivery is heating up.  The  global food market is worth $9 trillion.  Out of which the food delivery  sector is worth 99 billion.  In terms of the total food market pie, that  represents a mere one percent slice.</p><p> Such huge potential for growth has seen a frenzy of mergers and  acquisitions activity in the last three years as companies invest billions  to gobble up small arrivals.  Customers are hungry for convenience.</p><p> A click and swipe of a app will soon traditional phone calls as the most  convenient way to order.</p><p> In Cairo, the Delivery Hero brand management team collaborate with the  original service.</p><p> To stay ahead of the competition, Delivery Hero exports expertise in tech  and marketing to their regional companies.  </p><p> VANDEPITTE:  It is very important to understand the local ecosystem, and to  really develop the right product and technology for the local customer.  </p><p> [16:50:00] Geolocation is a fundamental part that we need to solve by  understanding the local needs.  And I give you an example of Saudi Arabia,  we don't have street names.  You don't have street numbers.  So, by having  technology to support the delivery boy, the delivery girl, to bring the  food to the customer, we contribute to creating an amazing take away  experience.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> QUEST:  As part of our ongoing commitment to fighting modern day slavery,  Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest tells me why every business needs a  social license.  You will hear him after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Every chief executive has to run their business with a fine moral  code.  That is the view of Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire who  has turned his attention from mining to fighting modern-day slavery.  He  says it's the job of every chief exec to help navigate away, from such  dangers as these.  </p><p> You will be familiar with them from freedom project, human trafficking,  slave labor, sex workers, inherited debt.  When he joined me in the c suite  I asked Andrew Forest why the time has now come for executive moral  leadership.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ANDREW FOREST, FOUNDER, FORTESCUE METALS GROUP:  I think every CEO in the  world has to run their businesses with their own moral code and they must  have a fine moral code.  </p><p> If they don't have a fine moral code, they're not going to be sustainable,  Richard.  That will be found out by consumers.  That will be found out by  the law.  You need to have a right to do business.  You need a social  license to operate these days.  Ten years ago, you didn't.  </p><p> QUEST:  You just said, you need a social license to operate, so you are  accepting that there needs to be a social component, a social  responsibility, in the social leadership for a CEO.</p><p> FORREST:  Yes, Richard.  That's absolutely correct.  I fundamentally  believe that business and particularly chief executives in business, must  set standards they would like to see across society.  Society backs their  business.  They can only produce a profit and loss statement and a decent  balance sheet because of society.  They are responsible to society to act  morally.</p><p> QUEST:  So, let's take for example, in Australia, the marriage equality  battle at the moment, where one of your fellow Australians firmly came out  in favor.  Others have come out against.  It raises and I am genuinely not  trying to take you down into a tricky area.  But it raises the question of  which issues that one goes for.  I can understand modern-day slavery but  let's take the marriage equality.</p><p> FORREST:  No, no, Richard, you go for issues under your control.  You're  not a politician, you're not a person who has to ponder on everything.  </p><p> [16:55:00] What you control, like your labor supply chains, you should be  ready to stand in moral judgment of the quality of labor and freedom of  those laborers.</p><p> Now, if you are saying, which your view on marriage, sex, or whatever it  is, I don't have a view on it, I can't control it.  I'm not going to.  But  if you say to me what about your 3500 suppliers, how do you know there is  not slavery in those supply chains?</p><p> I would have to say to you, Richard, I don't but I'm looking and I am  trying.</p><p> QUEST:  On the question of modern day slavery, the ability to quantify --  we all know it is going on.  We all know it is at a horrific level.  But  the ability to provide verifiable statistics.  How significant is that?</p><p> FORREST:  I think it is very, very significant, I found out yesterday how  significant that was, when the ILO and walk free index published a common  number, not only were we shared on the table by your own Ivanka Trump who  was committing the United States to fight slavery around the world.  But  the other end of the table introducing us for the Secretary-General of the  United Nations, the Prime Minister of Britain, in lined up by the side was  state leaders from all over the world.  And their committing to slavery.   And why are they committing?  Because you now can measure in their  countries.</p><p> QUEST:  They are committing but I've got a word for you, results.</p><p> FORREST:  Thanks, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  I will say it again, results, they have gotten now actually do  something.  Results.</p><p> FORREST:  And that is why we need CNN to hold them to account, that's why  your role in your support against moderate slavery is critical because your  analysis drives results.  Transparency, measurement and media drives  results.</p><p> QUEST:  We'll hold you to account.  </p><p> FORREST:  Oh, you do, sir.</p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you.  </p><p> FORREST:  Good to see you, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Spirited debate in the C-suite.  We'll have a Profitable Moment  after the break.  This is CNN.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  It's worth looking ahead to tomorrow  night's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS which comes from the IMF, International  Monetary Fund's annual meetings.  </p><p> Tomorrow night we will have the debate it will be between Christine  Lagarde, the French finance minister, the Indonesians, the Canadian finance  minister.  And hear what they say on the issues of austerity, what they say  about inequality, how they believe that the bubbles and inequalities and  imbalances in the economies at the moment could be dealt with in the  future.</p><p> QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from the IMF live tomorrow night.</p><p> Otherwise, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight from New York.  I'm  Richard Quest.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's  profitable.  I'll see you in Washington tomorrow!</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street. Dow Jones at a record again, of .2 of 1 percent. Nasdaq also at a record high. We'll bring you that in the trading post. Otherwise, sir, do the honors. I declare that to be a firm gavel on Wednesday, October the 11th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Walking away from Catalonia the president tells CNN, he want talks with Madrid, as businesses are abandoning the Spanish region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Walking away from NAFTA, President Trump is threatening to leave the deal, as a new round of negotiations begin, the President's been meeting the Canadian Prime Minister.</p><p>And walking away from Weinstein. The film company's partners consider cancelling their various deals.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City, where, of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, five days that will decide the future of Catalonia and indeed the cohesion of Spain. The country's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given the Catalonian president until Monday to clarify if he's declared independence or not. With the IMF already warning contagion, his answers whether this crisis is settled by dialogue or something more dramatic.</p><p>Both sides are now playing the waiting game. Let me show you exactly how this plays out. If you take Spain, Madrid in the center, Barcelona on the eastern coast. Madrid and Catalonia are retreating behind their respective red lines, a negotiating strategy. And they're waiting to see if either of the other side crosses the red line.</p><p>So, let's take the Madrid side first. If you look at Madrid, the Prime Minister Rajoy has refused to hold talks unless the independence claim is dropped. And he's warning that Catalonia will do great damage to itself and to business if it goes ahead with its independence. Today he said the crisis has already done more to hurt Catalan tourism than terror attacks in Barcelona. It's significantly -- Mariano Rajoy, the Prime Minister, bearing in mind what the Catalan President did yesterday, the prime minister says the next move is up to Catalonia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIANO RAJOY, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): It is the answer that Mr. Puigdemont will give to this issue that will mark the future of what's going to happen next. It is within his power to go back to legality, and to institutional normality or to continue with an instability period without perhaps losing Catalonia. We are living one of the worst moments in the recent history of democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, in his back pocket the prime minister always has the nuclear option of Article 155 of, the Spanish constitution that would allow him to basically impose direct rule once again on Catalonia. If he were to do that, well, on the other side, you have the red line from the Catalan President, who is insisting on talks without preconditions. Catalonia's economy does give him some leverage. It makes up about 20 percent of Spanish GDP and pays much more into the tax system of Madrid and Spain than it does get back from the country. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the Catalan President said it was time for proper talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLES PUIGDEMONT, CATALAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I believe that today we find ourselves in a moment of most importance. That we have no prior conditions to sit down and talk. Except that we must dialogue, and we must dialogue within adequate conditions. Maybe it could help dialogue if two people from the Catalan government and two people from the Spanish government simply agreed on one simple thing. Appointing a mediator, for instance. But we cannot ignore the fact that talks apathetical discussions need to come from recognizing reality.</p><p>And that is what we need to talk about. The relationship Catalonia, Spain, it does not work and there is majority of Catalan people that want to make Catalonia an independent state. And want to do that in agreement with the Spanish state. But we need to do that without conditions. We need to sit down and really talk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] QUEST: Spanish investors are treating this entire incident with a certain amount of trepidation and caution. Let's just take today. The evidence for this is the way Spanish stocks rebound, from Tuesday's losses, and outperformed the rest of Europe. But really, at 1.3 percent gain in the IBEX has to be seen the fall of the previous day, and almost certain knowledge that if there was to be detrimental move tomorrow, that market would turn down. The cost of buying Spanish debt, which rises bond to its lowest level of the month so far. Again, the ten-year bond, this would have to be seen in the context of an independence declaration or a worsening situation that would send the bond higher, almost certainly. Atika Shubert is live for us in Barcelona tonight. This level of uncertainty, Atika, these five days that the Prime Minister has given the Catalonia President. It's very tense.</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: absolutely. I mean, he's really turning the screws on Catalan President Puigdemont. I mean basically by asking him to clarify whether or not it was a declaration of independence. He's really trying to split, as well, the independence movement. Remember, it is fractured parliament here and Puigdemont is really sitting on a coalition of many different interests.</p><p>If he says for example, that no, it was only a symbolic declaration, then he could find that he doesn't have the support from those much more hardline separatists. If he says, you know -- if he says it is declaration of independence, well, that would be upping the stakes dramatically, a give Rajoy a reason -- the Prime Minister a reason to come in and take over the regional government. So, he is really turning the screws on the Catalan President. How he's going to respond in the next few days is what we're watching for.</p><p>QUEST: OK. The idea of mediation, the idea of talks, would be what? Talks about greater autonomy? I mean, listening to that interview, with Nic Robertson, where he talks about, you know, we have a right to independence. Well, even if you have temporary talks, talks to what?</p><p>SHUBERT: You know, the independence movement here goes back hundreds of years really, it has deep historical roots. But the most recent change here happened in 2006, when there was autonomy statute that Catalan had passed, and that was accepted by the Spanish government. Then in 2010, the constitutional, court struck that down. And ever since independence then the independence movement has been re-sparked. It was basically revived under that.</p><p>So, if there were any talks to take place, it would be about this autonomy statute. What kind of an autonomy would Catalonia need? What more would they need? Financial independence. What else do they want? And so, I think that's what the talks in itself would be about. But, you know, these -- this idea that there will be no preconditions is something that the Prime Minister says is absolutely a no go. He Will not have any dialogue, he says, until it's clear that there has not been a declaration of independence.</p><p>QUEST: Atika Shubert in Barcelona. Atika, thank you. Let's talk to Professor Luis Cabral of the International Business, NYU Stern. Good to see you Professor.</p><p>LUIS CABRAL, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, NYU STERN: Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>CABRAL: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Where is the pressure coming from here? There's the political pressure in one since, but how significant is the business pressure? Whether it's the Caixa Bank moving out, the other banks, the other companies taking advantage. Where does commerce come into it?</p><p>CABRAL: The biggest pressure is the large banks and large corporations that are headquartered in Barcelona, and that are thinking very seriously about moving to Madrid. Because if there is independence or even if there is a situation of uncertainty continues the way it is now, it's not good business to be in Barcelona for them. And that can have a huge negative impact on the Catalonia economy. In fact, that's already been happening for a number of years, by the way, because of the language laws in Catalonia. So, this would only accelerate that movement.</p><p>QUEST: One assumes that the Catalonian government does not wish to commit financial suicide, or at least economic suicide. Now, similar arguments with Scotland. If they vote for independence, they leave the European Union.</p><p>CABRAL: That's true. And as of now, it's not clear what would happen to Catalonia if there were to become independent. You would need all of the European Union countries to vote in favor of them becoming members of the European Union. And it's far from obvious that would be the case.</p><p>QUEST: Well, Spain certainly wouldn't and the United Kingdom wouldn't.</p><p>CABRAL: Probably not.</p><p>QUEST: Assuming the U.K. is still there, of course.</p><p>CABRAL: That is correct. And so, that's part of the potential cost of independence. Now, of course, it's not very credible to say that we will never talk to you again. And I think some sort of a deal agreement, possibly even membership, would eventually be achieved, in my opinion.</p><p>[16:10:00] QUEST: But what do they want -- I mean, you heard me ask Atika Shubert this. When Catalonia suspends its declaration of independence, and there's more talks or mediation, the two are diametrically opposed. The Prime Minister cannot give ground -- he said this tonight. You know, you've got five days to make it clear that you're not declaring independence.</p><p>CABRAL: Yes. I'm not sure that they were expecting Rajoy to be as strict and strong as he's Ben right now. Perhaps what they were thinking about -- who knows what they were thinking about. It is perhaps they could renegotiate the independent -- the autonomy statute and the shadow of possible independence. And they're just realizing that doesn't work. That's not working. At least Rajoy is playing hardball, and it seems to me that Catalonia is going to lose this battle.</p><p>QUEST: Right. And just to brief us -- for those who doesn't follow this as closely as yourself -- the Spanish opposition at the national level is also in favor of the Rajoy position. I mean, they may not want such a hardline position but Rajoy is speaking largely for the entire Spanish body politic.</p><p>CABRAL: That is correct. And for a significant fraction of Catalonia.</p><p>QUEST: Do we actually know?</p><p>CABRAL: We don't have the exact numbers my idea is that it's probably split down the middle, very close to 50/50.</p><p>QUEST: Which is a very dangerous area to go into some call for independence, claiming you have a mandate when 50 percent of the people actually don't want anything to do with it.</p><p>CABRAL: Exactly. So, there is a majority of people a referendum voted in favor of independence. But the turnout was quite low. And so, there's probably about 50 percent of Catalonians who are against independence. At least in the way that's being prosed right now. And so, it's a difficult - - and the president -- the leader of Catalonia, in my opinion, is between a rock and a hard place, because the more extremist Catalonians are pushing very hard for independence. But on the other hand, it just realized it would be tough for him if he were to go ahead with independence right now.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, professor. Thank you very much indeed. Much appreciated. Thank you very much.</p><p>Spain's economy minister will be joining me live on tomorrow night's program. Luis de Guindos will be with us at the annual meeting of the lMF in Washington. You can see that interview, as well as my debate on the global economy with the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde. It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tomorrow at this time, live from Washington.</p><p>So, we need too immediately to our new trading post, and all three -- let me find -- here we go. All three of the markets have closed at record. That means it's the 48th record of the year for the Dow. The 44th for the S&amp;P. And crucially, it is the 56th for the Nasdaq. One of the reasons -- not only just the news generally -- but one of the reasons for these three records, the Fed minutes said that there needed to be some patience with raising rates. The minutes just came out.</p><p>Delta Airlines despite the incidents of hurricanes and other delays, Delta Airlines had earnings better than expected. So, put this together, and you've got records on the Dow over 20 -- I mean, 23,000 is looking extremely touchable and within grasp on the S&amp;P 500 and on the Nasdaq. You've got nearly 50 records on the Dow. And no wonder Donald Trump, the president, has described the market movements as unprecedented. And the signs of fear in the market at the moment, absolutely nothing there. But remain at 84 on the CNN Money fear and greed index, which is one of extreme greed. As you can see, green just about all around the set as we have got Paul La Monica. All three are records. And not just that, good records. The momentum is there. There're not eking out these records. They seem to want to head there.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, these are solid gains. And I think we've talked about this on the show. Pretty much since the beginning of the year. I think a lot of it, despite the President taking credit for it, is in spite of what's going on in Washington. Corporate earnings have been good. You noted Delta. We had Blackrock reporting some good results. And hopefully Will get decent ones from the big thanks later this week. But consumers still spending, corporations still spending. I'm just not so sure this is about politics, because, again, as my colleague Matt Eagan pointed out, we had a lot of records under President Obama, too. It's not a unique phenomenon --</p><p>QUEST: Oh, but 48 in a year. It's not a -- I mean, we'll need to find out. Maybe you could get CNNMoney to see if this is a record so far in terms of number of records</p><p>LA MONICA: A record of records.</p><p>QUEST: A record of records. Thank you. A record of records. The IMF meets. They've warmed about inequality.</p><p>[16:15:00] Schauble has warned about bubbles and imbalances that exist out there, as a result of liquidity. The Fed today suggesting that patience might be required from the September meeting. Does that put off a rate rise to next year?</p><p>LA MONICA: I doubt it. I think that the Fed will probably try and sneak in one more rate hike in December, as long as earnings remain pretty strong and the market is doing well. And, of course, they're looking at inflation, which is starting to creep up a little bit, because of wage growth. We had a very nice jobs report last week with regards to what the wage growth number was, even though we lost jobs last month. We did get nearly 3 percentage wage growth. And the Fed, I think, is watching that very closely.</p><p>QUEST: Now, Coach has become tapestry. And we think that it might have something to do with this. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAROL KING, SONGWRITER, RECORDING ARTIST: Now my tapestry is unraveling. He's come to take me back. He's come to take me back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Carol King.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, very, very nice. Very well-played. I seriously doubt that that was the motivation. I did speak to someone at Coach. As they now -- they now call it --</p><p>QUEST: Don't ruin the day.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- they now call it tapestry -- they did acknowledge -- it's a bit of a cutesy name that plays off the whole notion of weaving several brands into one. Putting that all aside, this is really similar to what we had with Alphabet and Google. There is nothing that people go to that is Alphabet per se. You still go to Google. You go to YouTube. In the same way here with Coach, the Coach brand name -- if you like to buy handbag and wallets from Coach, it's still going to be called Coach. They're still going to have Kate Spade, and Sarah Wiseman, the other two brand they recently acquired. And I think that's what this signals. Maybe Coach wants to do another deal. And having an umbrella sort of name to house all of these different brands, that seems to what they're looking to do.</p><p>QUEST: I seem to have left my wallet. Could you lend m, a bit of money -- Paul thank you very much indeed.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Extraordinary. More developments as show business -- the world of show business turns against Harvey Weinstein. And the allegations are piling up. Now the Manhattan District Attorney is defending his decision not to charge Weinstein with sex crimes. You're going to hear from him next. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>QUEST: Straight to Washington, where the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is speaking to reporters after meeting with the U.S. President.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: We know that the success of any society depends on the full socioeconomic participation of women, because women succeed, we all succeed. And whether it's flexible hours, parental leave, affordable child care, diversity training, equal pay, or any other number of initiatives. It's incumbent of us across the public and private spheres to be proud agents for change.</p><p>[16:20:08] Following that theme, this morning I had a productive round table with WomenOne, where we discussed the current barriers to global gender equality and marked the international day of the girl. I also met with the committee on ways and means, and we had a great conversation about the importance of the Canada/U.S. partnership. And I just wrapped up a very good meeting with President Trump, where we talked about trade, security and economic growth. As we know, the fourth round of NAFTA negotiations is under way here in Washington. And the President and I reiterated our commitment to in good tired faith to give this deal a much- needed upgrade. NAFTA has benefited millions of people and can benefit millions more. We're pleased to have the opportunity to modernize this trade agreement for the current economy, a modernization that acknowledges the importance of gender, the environment and indigenous and labor rights.</p><p>We know that there are millions of jobs on both sides of the Canada/U.S. border that rely on trade and investment. In fact, Canada is among the top export markets for the majority of U.S. states. And so, it's imperative that we get a fair deal for Canadians, Americans and Mexicans alike. That's what our teams at all orders of government are working hard towards.</p><p>QUEST: Justin Trudeau, talking there on NAFTA. He describes NAFTA as an upgrade to NAFTA, to modernize it. We'll get more details on that in the hours ahead. Also talking about women and the whole gender question. Harvey Weinstein comes into all of this, of course. Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer, is on his way to rehab. His wife of ten years has left him. The company -- the Weinstein Company is facing an uncertain future. The claims of sexual misconduct just keep coming. More women are accusing the Hollywood producer of rape. We must stress, Harvey Weinstein denies those claims. The indications are the allegations haven't finished. Amazon is reviewing its projects with the Weinstein Company. This week his name was removed from the credits of its shows like \"Project Runway.\" The Weinstein Company board has expressed shock and dismay at new allegations of extreme sexual misconduct and assault.</p><p>An earlier than Manhattan District Attorney explained his decision not to press charges in the past.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CY VANCE, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY: I understand that folks -- folks are outraged by his behavior. I understand that there are many other allegations that have surfaced, but I our case, we really did what I think the law obligates us to do. Focus on the evidence and the facts that we have. and then I relied on the true professionals to help guide to the decision, which is not always going to be the popular decision. That's the nature of being a prosecutor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: In the past few minutes, the Academy of Motion Picture and Arts -- basically the Oscars -- say they will hold a special meeting on Saturday about the Weinstein allegations. We have Erin Gloria Ryan is here. Senior editor for \"The Daily Beast\" and a CNN contributor. In an op-ed for \"The Daily Beast\" she defended victims who are reluctant to come forward. It's not surprising they're reluctant to come forward, is it? They are promised anonymity, or they are promised safe harbor, but the reality is most of them know that until it becomes a cause celeb like this, they could be alone, and they could be victimized.</p><p>ERIN GLORIA RYAN, SENIOR EDITOR, THE DAILY BEAST: Right. I think any time you're a woman who comes forward with this sort of allegation, you've got someone as powerful as Harvey Weinstein, you're basically setting off an atomic bomb with yourself at the center -- which I wrote in the piece for \"The Daily Beast.\" It's so risky, and it's so unlikely that you're going to come out of it unscathed by your own career.</p><p>QUEST: What is the answer in that situation? Because you're talking about a real politic situation, where an individual goes up against a famous or powerful person. How does a company adapt then to allow for that?</p><p>RYAN: I think that brings up a very interesting point. Because Weinstein couldn't have done this without all the people that were enabling him along the way. There were people who were more powerful than the actresses he is he was allegedly victimizing who knew about this. Who didn't say anything. There were ostensibly film executives who heard about this who didn't do anything. There's an entertainment press that in their thirst for access was willing two just, you know, just push their morals aside in order to keep these buried.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think people knew how bad it was or how egregious it was?</p><p>RYAN: I don't want to speculate on whether everybody knew every detail of it. I think this is the first time we've seen all these, kind of stomach- churning details in one place. I think the fact that people had indicators that there might be something that bad there and didn't speak up is pretty damning to the culture of entertainment as a whole.</p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST: But are we in danger -- and I'm choosing my words carefully and I'm treading delicately. Are we in danger of turning Harvey Weinstein into the devil incarnate with all the coverage, and everybody heaping more opprobrium on top of him? When the real story is not Weinstein per se. It is how it was able to perpetuate.</p><p>RYAN: I think it definitely is that. I think it's also the way that this -- this isn't just him. And this isn't just this industry. When I was listening to that tape yesterday, there's a tape that the New York Police Department got in a sting in 2015. I was listening to that yesterday. He's trying to coerce a woman into his hotel room. I related to that tape so much. Not because Weinstein ever targeted me. But because me and every single woman I know has had a man try to treat us that way in our lives.</p><p>It's something endemic to American culture. It's something that's endemic to different industries. Media, tech, trucking, service. This is a conversation we should be having nationally. It should be not just about Weinstein. Because getting him out of there is not going to fix the problem. But we should be doing is teaching men about consent. And what we should be doing is teaching men in a position to stand up they need to.</p><p>QUEST: So let me ask you, and I ask this as somebody who's got three sisters and been around this issue most of me adult life -- most of my life. What then does need to be done. To happen, to have that conversation, to make them? Because these allegations, in some shape or form, sexual harassment has been known about by men for a very long time.</p><p>RYAN: Yes. I think that the important thing is for men to take a couple minutes and be alone and silent with themselves today and consider whether or not they've ever enabled this sort of behavior. And how they can personally not enable it in the future.</p><p>QUEST: Very grateful you came and talked to us. Thank you so much indeed.</p><p>We'll continue tonight. NAFTA negotiations on round. We just heard the Canadian Prime Minister describe it as an upgrade to NAFTA. The talks are resuming, and Justin Trudeau turns on the charm at the White House.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning President Trump's position on NAFTA is full of poison pills. And we give Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook, an all-access pass into our lives. A marketing professor says there is a reason for that.</p><p>As we continue tonight this is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is rejecting Catalonia's call for negotiating independence from Spain, the prime minister has given the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont until Monday to clarify whether his vision has declared independence or not.</p><p>[16:30:00] If the answer is yes, and Puigdemont refuses to reconsider by the following Thursday, Prime Minister Rajoy says Madrid could then impose direct rule.</p><p>Firefighters in California are having a tough time, as they battle massive fires, winds are expected to pick up in the area. That could threaten to spread the blaze. So far, there's no rain in the forecast. At least 21 people have been killed. Hundreds more people are missing. Early estimates suggest property value damage is more than $65 billion.</p><p>Multiple sources close to the White House tell CNN that President Trump is expected to appoint Kirstjen Nielsen as the new U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. The 45-year-old Nielsen would fill the vacancy left by John Kelly who is now the chief of staff. She currently works now as a deputy to Kelly.</p><p>President Trump says he is stronger and tougher on North Korea than his secretary of state. Earlier Pyongyang's foreign minister says President Trump in his words lit the wick of war in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Trump put North Korea's leader on notice in that address, referring to Kim Jong-un as rocket man, in saying that the country would not survive an American attack.</p><p>Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond says that although the U.K. economy is fundamentally robust, Brexit is causing a cloud of certainty, which needs to be cleared. Hammond told lawmakers the U.K. should prepare for the worst if no Brexit deal is reached with the E.U.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILIP HAMMOND, FINANCE MINISTER, GREAT BRITAIN: We also have to consider the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations, where we have noncooperation. Worst-case scenario, even a situation where people are not necessarily acting in their own economic self-interest. So, we need to prepare for a wide range of scenarios.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The top U.S. business lobby group is warning that NAFTA negotiations are at risk of complete collapse as the latest round of talks actually get underway.</p><p>The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau who you heard a moment ago was at the White House meeting the president, who you heard, has repeatedly threatened to leave NAFTA. President Trump said whatever happens, a new deal has to be fair to all sides.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's possible we won't be able to make a deal, and it's possible that we will. We have a great personal relationship, and we have a relationship now is two countries that is as close as ever. But we will see if we can do the changes that we need. We have to protect our workers and in all fairness the prime minister was to protect Canada and his people also/</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: On the eve of the talks that are about to start, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, chief executive Tom Donahue has criticized the Trump administration for putting what it calls poison pill proposals into the negotiations. What are these poison pill various different things? OK.</p><p>Here you have, of course, the NAFTA area, Canada, the United States and Mexico. And the NAFTA negotiation in round 4, you can hear the poison pills are rattling around the medicine cabinet. The first one is the rules of origin, determining how much of product must be manufactured in north America to remain duty-free. For example, the car industry, most at risk, 62 percent if the current rule.</p><p>Trump wants that to be higher and he wants within the rules of origin specificity so that it's not just one country. It specifies how much has to come from the United States, which, of course, would defeat the whole object of having the single market.</p><p>Then you have a sunset clause, the U.S. wants NAFTA to expire every five years until all three countries agree to whatever changes are necessary. However, business says what's the point of having a NAFTA treaty if every five years -- I mean let's face it, businesses are making 10, 15, 20-year decisions, not five-year momentary decisions. So, they say that is not going to work.</p><p>And finally, dispute resolution. U.S. wants to ditch the neutral arbitration mechanism. Put it all together, and you have poison pills that could scupper, because the others will not agree. The Mexicans and Canadians will not agree to these fairly dramatic situations.</p><p>At any rate to put this into perspective, Paula Newton who was up in Ottawa with the Canadian position, Clare Sebastian is following the U.S. position. We'll start with you, Paula, Ms. Newton, because your prime minister is in the United States at the moment. Is Canada prepared for failure of these talks in the same way that President Trump seemingly is?</p><p>[16:35:00] PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, and I know speaking to the Canadian officials behind the scenes that they do not put it past the president to eventually, because he needs those campaign wins, most political wins, Richard, to do what he says might do which is terminate the deal.</p><p>But this is what the Canadians are doing. Before that meeting with Trump, Justin Trudeau was on Capitol Hill talking to a very powerful committee there, the committee that is stacked with Republicans to know how important Canada is in terms of a trading relationship for their states. And they are saying, look. Number one, Canada is the U.S.'s largest customer, more trade, the by more than the U.K., China, Japan combined. In number two, even if the president signs an executive order, ending NAFTA, it is Congress that has the final say as to whether that happens. There might be some constitutional dispute about that. We'll wait and see. But right now, Congress is saying, we do hold sway here.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is because he's renegotiating NAFTA at the moment, Richard. Remember on the campaign trail and in fact multiple times including this week President Trump has threatened to rip the whole thing up just do away with it. In that he can do unilaterally. It's called article 2205 and NAFTA, he's allowed to just make that decision, that would trigger a six-month process where he could rescind the decision during that six months but he can do it.</p><p>QUEST: But Clare there is no movement as yet, seemingly they are negotiating, but these poison pills are destined to scupper because they are perceived to be not in good faith.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely. Those of us with untrained eyes in the area of trade deals, there is -- doesn't seem to be any way that the three sides can agree on this. Mexico is deeply alarmed by the whole rules of origin thing the U.S. could apply one rule to themselves, one to something else. Canada is alarmed of getting rid of dispute settlements.</p><p>QUEST: Pause there. Stay with me, Paula. Justin Trudeau is answering questions. Let's have a listen.</p><p>JUSTIN Trudeau, Prime Minister, Canada: How good NAFTA has been for millions of citizens of Canada, of the United States and indeed for Mexico. I know there are opportunities to significantly improve these trade deals in ways that will benefit citizens right across United States and Canada as well</p><p>And I truly believe that we can work together in a meaningful way to bring those benefits to our citizens. Negotiations are difficult. Unpredictable at times but I truly believe that the presidents focused on creating benefits for his citizens, for the middle class the way we are. And that positive trade deals, modernized trade deals, we will get that done. So that is something that I continue to focus on. The conversations we've had with the way and means committee, the conversations I've had with governors across the country., the conversations I've had with various leaders of industry have all emphasized that they see the direct benefits that NAFTA has brought to their communities, to their economies, and can continue to bring in the future. so --</p><p>QUEST: So, Paula Newton in Ottawa. Does he believe that? I mean, you said to me he's preparing to leave. Or, no, he's recognizing that that could be an option. Nuclear option.</p><p>[16:40:00] NEWTON: It is. But it will be Donald Trump's to trigger or their decision to walk away from the table. They need to prepare for those talks to break down. You heard him now that isn't much different from what he said from the last few months. What is important is what happened in the last couple hours. He took the measure of the president and tried to determine exactly how serious he is, not about terminating NAFTA, but how serious he is about going back to those poison pills. What determines a win for Donald Trump?</p><p>And that's what the prime minister was trying to find out, and we'll know in the next little while whether he got to that end, and will instruct his negotiators accordingly.</p><p>QUEST: Paula and Clare, thank you.</p><p>Four giants of technology, and they have one goal. In a moment, the inside story to the race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company.</p><p>QUEST: Google has had to admit there is a bug in its new home mini speaker. Tech bloggers discovered the smart speaker secretly recorded just about everything it hears Google issued a software update to turn off the function. The device expected to go on sale next week.</p><p>As for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they seem to dominate headlines and our very lives. Take the last 48 hour for example. This is a list of headlines. Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping. Amazon exploring ways to deliver items inside your home. Zuckerberg apologizes for Puerto Rico VR stunt.</p><p>Apple strikes deal with Spielberg's Amblin.</p><p>As Professor Scott Galloway of marketing at NYU Stern, the author of, \"The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google.\"</p><p>Why are they so successful? Is it because they have basically come up with something that we find that we actually need? Admittedly, we didn't know about it before but that is because it had not been invented.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR, NYU STERN: Yes, it runs deeper than that, Richard. Google is our modern man' god. As we become wealthier, more educated, we're less dependent on a super being, but still he huge questions. Used to pray to the gods, will my kid be all right. Now symptoms in treatment of croup typed into the Google query box. When the six questions have never been asked before that are presented to Google in the history of mankind. No coach, Rabbi, priest has that sort of credibility, Google is our modern God.</p><p>Facebook taps into our need to love and love others through pictures that reinforce relationships. Amazon is our consumptive gut. More for less is always a strategy that works. An Apple appeals to our reproductive organs, Apple is a new symbol of wealth, power, innovation and says you have better genes to potential mates.</p><p>QUEST: OK, but at the end of the day, they are doing a good job, they are doing what they say they will do. You can't fault them. And in this digital age of the Internet economy, they are serving a purpose.</p><p>GALLOWAY: They do a great job. And I don't fault them. I think the question is, should we as a society ask questions around, do we no longer worship at the altar of kindness and character but innovation and hold these companies to different standard than we hold other companies?</p><p>Your firm, this firm, wasn't weaponized by Russia. You have checks and balances in place that cost you a lot of money and reduce your bottom line. Yet we have decided to Google and Facebook aren't subject to the same responsibilities as other media companies.</p><p>QUEST: Is the possibility on that point, on the weaponization, for example, the weaponization of Facebook, which -- you're concerned about.</p><p>[16:45:00] That really, it's happened much faster. it may have taken 40 years for this company to have got size, heft and a certain amount of influence and power.</p><p>But the speed with which these are, we haven't had time to put in place the necessary safeguards.</p><p>GALLOWAY: The technology and innovation has outpaced the public policy or ability to realm with it. A lot of people believe that Facebook is not even sure they know what they fully have right now.</p><p>QUEST: Let's look at the graphs of share prices which I now is not exactly a barometer of anything other than people's wealth. But if you look at, say, for example, any of them, Apple, Amazon, Google -- here's Apple. Facebook -- I beg your pardon. Look at that. Pretty much solid that afterwards everybody said, oh lord, this has gone badly.</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, the combined market capitalization of these four companies is equivalent to the GDP of India. Amazon which is paid 1.4 billion in corporate income tax whereas Walmart has paid 64 billion since the great recession, it Amazon has added the value of Walmart to its market in the last 24 months. We have never seen companies this powerful.</p><p>QUEST: So, if you accept, and you have at the beginning of this, that they're serving a purpose, they're doing it extremely well.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: And there's a need or we've discovered a need for what they want. Are you suggesting regulation to impose those forms of safeguards, checks and balances that a Time Warner has? Or are you looking at something like antitrust, break them up?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I'm suggesting we hold them to the same standards we hold other companies and we begin to ask hard questions -- I think we suffer from a gross idolatry of innovation and youth that has created two-class system, one for all corporations and one for them.</p><p>Antitrust, I don't know, if I were on the board of Amazon, I would spin the AWS prophylactically, because I think that Facebook and Russia situation is the tipping point, and we're starting to see that the worm has turned. Whether or not antitrust I don' know. You know where the war is going to break out against big tech, Richard, it's going to break out in Europe who registers all of the downside, the job destruction, tax avoidance of the big tech companies, but registers very little of the upside. The war is going to break out against big tech in Europe.</p><p>QUEST: Are you on Facebook?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I am.</p><p>QUEST: Do you use Amazon?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I love all of them, I think they are fantastic.</p><p>QUEST: but with a but dot, dot, dot.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, this is the big question. What is always good for the consumer always good for society? And I think that's the fundamental question.</p><p>QUEST: Glad you came in to talk about.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thanks so much, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, tech companies are also disrupting our daily food chains. The Traders series now as we meet one company which is capitalizing on our appetite for convenience.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A pang of hunger in Egypt starts a chain reaction which crosses continents. Cairo restaurant Al Dia prepares the dish.</p><p>And in under 30 minutes it is ready to eat. But the delivery of this meal to the customer in Cairo relies on a billion-dollar company based in Berlin 5000 km away.</p><p>PIETER-JAN VANDEPITTE, COO, DELIVERY HERO: Delivery Hero is a company active in online food ordering, we actually grew into a global company with activities in more than 40 countries. And we operate almost like what I called a little bit the United Nations of food delivery with strong entrepreneurs in the countries.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Customers can order from thousands of restaurants using the companies app. Founded in 2011 Delivery Hero is hoping to stay ahead of newcomers such as Uber Eats and Amazon.</p><p>VANDEPITTE: In 2016, we had close to 200 million orders. And we keep on growing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The trade-enomics of food delivery is heating up. The global food market is worth $9 trillion. Out of which the food delivery sector is worth 99 billion. In terms of the total food market pie, that represents a mere one percent slice.</p><p>Such huge potential for growth has seen a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions activity in the last three years as companies invest billions to gobble up small arrivals. Customers are hungry for convenience.</p><p>A click and swipe of a app will soon traditional phone calls as the most convenient way to order.</p><p>In Cairo, the Delivery Hero brand management team collaborate with the original service.</p><p>To stay ahead of the competition, Delivery Hero exports expertise in tech and marketing to their regional companies.</p><p>VANDEPITTE: It is very important to understand the local ecosystem, and to really develop the right product and technology for the local customer.</p><p>[16:50:00] Geolocation is a fundamental part that we need to solve by understanding the local needs. And I give you an example of Saudi Arabia, we don't have street names. You don't have street numbers. So, by having technology to support the delivery boy, the delivery girl, to bring the food to the customer, we contribute to creating an amazing take away experience.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: As part of our ongoing commitment to fighting modern day slavery, Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest tells me why every business needs a social license. You will hear him after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Every chief executive has to run their business with a fine moral code. That is the view of Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire who has turned his attention from mining to fighting modern-day slavery. He says it's the job of every chief exec to help navigate away, from such dangers as these.</p><p>You will be familiar with them from freedom project, human trafficking, slave labor, sex workers, inherited debt. When he joined me in the c suite I asked Andrew Forest why the time has now come for executive moral leadership.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW FOREST, FOUNDER, FORTESCUE METALS GROUP: I think every CEO in the world has to run their businesses with their own moral code and they must have a fine moral code.</p><p>If they don't have a fine moral code, they're not going to be sustainable, Richard. That will be found out by consumers. That will be found out by the law. You need to have a right to do business. You need a social license to operate these days. Ten years ago, you didn't.</p><p>QUEST: You just said, you need a social license to operate, so you are accepting that there needs to be a social component, a social responsibility, in the social leadership for a CEO.</p><p>FORREST: Yes, Richard. That's absolutely correct. I fundamentally believe that business and particularly chief executives in business, must set standards they would like to see across society. Society backs their business. They can only produce a profit and loss statement and a decent balance sheet because of society. They are responsible to society to act morally.</p><p>QUEST: So, let's take for example, in Australia, the marriage equality battle at the moment, where one of your fellow Australians firmly came out in favor. Others have come out against. It raises and I am genuinely not trying to take you down into a tricky area. But it raises the question of which issues that one goes for. I can understand modern-day slavery but let's take the marriage equality.</p><p>FORREST: No, no, Richard, you go for issues under your control. You're not a politician, you're not a person who has to ponder on everything.</p><p>[16:55:00] What you control, like your labor supply chains, you should be ready to stand in moral judgment of the quality of labor and freedom of those laborers.</p><p>Now, if you are saying, which your view on marriage, sex, or whatever it is, I don't have a view on it, I can't control it. I'm not going to. But if you say to me what about your 3500 suppliers, how do you know there is not slavery in those supply chains?</p><p>I would have to say to you, Richard, I don't but I'm looking and I am trying.</p><p>QUEST: On the question of modern day slavery, the ability to quantify -- we all know it is going on. We all know it is at a horrific level. But the ability to provide verifiable statistics. How significant is that?</p><p>FORREST: I think it is very, very significant, I found out yesterday how significant that was, when the ILO and walk free index published a common number, not only were we shared on the table by your own Ivanka Trump who was committing the United States to fight slavery around the world. But the other end of the table introducing us for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister of Britain, in lined up by the side was state leaders from all over the world. And their committing to slavery. And why are they committing? Because you now can measure in their countries.</p><p>QUEST: They are committing but I've got a word for you, results.</p><p>FORREST: Thanks, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: I will say it again, results, they have gotten now actually do something. Results.</p><p>FORREST: And that is why we need CNN to hold them to account, that's why your role in your support against moderate slavery is critical because your analysis drives results. Transparency, measurement and media drives results.</p><p>QUEST: We'll hold you to account.</p><p>FORREST: Oh, you do, sir.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you.</p><p>FORREST: Good to see you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Spirited debate in the C-suite. We'll have a Profitable Moment after the break. This is CNN.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. It's worth looking ahead to tomorrow night's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS which comes from the IMF, International Monetary Fund's annual meetings.</p><p>Tomorrow night we will have the debate it will be between Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, the Indonesians, the Canadian finance minister. And hear what they say on the issues of austerity, what they say about inequality, how they believe that the bubbles and inequalities and imbalances in the economies at the moment could be dealt with in the future.</p><p>QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from the IMF live tomorrow night.</p><p>Otherwise, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight from New York. I'm Richard Quest. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. I'll see you in Washington tomorrow!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017101101cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PP9-BPT1-DXH2-63C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 11, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

Regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons and identifying both priorities and barriers.</p><p>Panellist Donovan Guttieres, representing the major group for children and youth, said that, while 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality to the Forum, good examples of participation are more often the exception than the rule. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he said the Forum must rethink the way it fosters participation.</p><p>Panellist Pooja Rangaprasad, Director at the Society for International Development, focused on global democratic governance. She wondered whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations, recommending that the Organization establish a mechanism for resolving crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development.</p><p>In the ensuing discussions, representatives of Government, major groups and stakeholders agreed that civil society needs a bigger say in the Forum, with a speaker from the women\u2019s major group stressing that discussions should take place at the national and regional levels \u201cbecause that is where the people are\u201d. A speaker from the indigenous peoples\u2019 major group likewise appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass\u2011roots consultations targeting those being left behind.</p><p>\u201cWe need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,\u201d said a representative of the major group for children and youth, who objected to civil society\u2019s tokenistic participation in the Forum. On that point, France\u2019s delegate said her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>Several speakers underscored the link between human rights and sustainable development, including the representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group, who suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that reflects the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights. Norway\u2019s delegate, expressing alarm at attacks on human rights and environmental rights defenders, said civil society must have space to hold Governments to account. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved,\u201d she said.</p><p>Also today, the Forum held a thematic review on the interface between science and policy that featured a briefing by the independent group of scientists preparing the Global Sustainable Development Report for release at the September Summit.</p><p>Report Co-Chair Peter Messerli of the Center for Development and Environment at the University of Bern said the report will identify targets that are on track to be achieved and those that not, citing hunger, inequality, environment as areas in which results are going in the wrong direction. The report will also pinpoint trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed, he said.</p><p>Noting that science can identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, co-chair Endah Murniningtyas, Indonesia\u2019s former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, said the report will highlight the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Panellist Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer of the International Science Council, said scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, drawing attention to a global science funding initiative.</p><p>Panellist Meera Joshi, former head of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. Citing her experience overseeing yellow cabs and Uber cars, she stressed the importance for policies to be based on data, not anecdotes.</p><p>When the floor opened for discussion, France\u2019s representative stressed the need to build science capacity in Africa to better understand its challenges, including inequality and effects of climate change. Her counterpart from Jamaica noted, however, that collecting data is a challenge for small island developing States.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Forum \u2014 meeting under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council on the theme \u201cEmpowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality\u201d \u2014 held a discussion on implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and between nations.</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will reconvene at noon on Friday, 12 July, to continue its work.</p><p>Thematic Discussion</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development began the day with a thematic discussion titled \u201cPerspectives of society\u201d, moderated by Katarina Popovic, Secretary\u2011General, International Council for Adult Education and Representative, education and academia stakeholder group to the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group; and Paola Simonetti, Deputy Director, Economic and Social Policy Department, International Trade Union Confederation and Co-Chair of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group. It featured presentations by Jose Viera, Chief Executive Officer, World Blind Union and Co\u2011Lead, Major Groups Task Group on High-Level Political Forum Reform; Pooja Rangaprasad, Director, Policy &amp; Advocacy, Financing for Development, Society for International Development and Civil Society Financing for Development Group; Warda Rina, Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development, and Co-Chair, Asia Pacific Regional Civil Society Organizations Engagement Mechanism; and Donovan Guttieres, major group for children and youth.</p><p>KIRA CHRISTIANNE DANGANAN AZUCENA (Philippines), Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council, said the session would highlight the essential role that major groups and other stakeholders play in implementing and monitoring the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It would also hear about progress and challenges that various groups face in implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Ms. SIMONETTI said that, as the first phase of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals concludes, it is time to determine how the review process can be carried forward. During this session, major groups and other stakeholders \u2014 which have contributed to regional forums and national review mechanisms \u2014 can report on their contributions, and discuss whether the Forum is faithfully carrying out its mandate.</p><p>Mr. VIERA, outlining a set of principles to make the review process more democratic and productive, proposed greater emphasis on the inclusion of all groups, especially those most marginalized. Reform of the Forum should be based on results-oriented actions, an analysis of shortcomings and a determination of the systemic factors that lead to them. Participants must be more dynamic and not just congratulate themselves on what has been achieved. More resources should be made available to civil society, especially at the national level, while in the Forum, there must be more room for civil society to contribute. To exclude these principles from the Forum\u2019s reform would be to miss out on the many opportunities offered by the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>A representative of the children and youth major group from the Philippines, underscoring the need to step up stakeholder engagement, said that, in her region, many non-governmental organizations feel they are not part of the 2030 Agenda process. Having contributed to national review processes, they want feedback from Governments. \u201cWe need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,\u201d she said, calling for an end to the tokenistic participation of civil society.</p><p>A representative of the women\u2019s major group from Rwanda said women and girls \u201cin all their diversity\u201d must be at the heart of discussions. Noting that patriarchal systems limit choices, she called for greater investment in accessible, gender-responsive social services. For societies to be inclusive, and women and girls to be empowered, the broader system must be addressed, she added.</p><p>A representative of the indigenous people\u2019s major group said there is a huge gap in the participation and inclusion of indigenous peoples at the national level during preparations for voluntary national reviews. She appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass\u2011roots consultations targeting those being left behind. Noting that 92 per cent of the targets underpinning the Goals are linked to legally binding human rights instruments, she said the human rights obligations of States must be integrated into voluntary national reviews.</p><p>A representative of the Asia-Pacific Regional Civil Society Organization Engagement Mechanism drew attention to the situation of migrant female workers and called for the establishment of just, equitable and sustainable economies.</p><p>The representative of the Philippines said his country takes pride in its consultative processes when it prepares its voluntary national reviews. Such reviews are an opportunity to connect with stakeholders from different sectors and regions. He added that his country\u2019s reports are posted online for public comment and recommendations.</p><p>The representative of France said the Forum\u2019s wealth is based on the unique place it gives to civil society and the major groups. She added that her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the bloc considers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to be a shared responsibility that depends on the participation of all stakeholders.</p><p>The representative of Belgium drew attention to the absence of youth voices from the global South. The Goals are a worldwide story in which everyone \u2014 including young people \u2014 must have a say. \u201cWe may not have decades of working experience, but that may be our strength,\u201d she stated.</p><p>Ms. POPOVIC said the discussion would turn to ways of integrating cross\u2011cutting topics and thematic processes, such as development financing, food security and science, technology and innovation.</p><p>Ms. RANGAPRASAD said the key question is raising global democratic governance. Much is heard about illicit financial flows as a challenge to be addressed, but it is often packaged as a \u201ctechnical definition\u201d issue when it is, in fact, a political question about whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Reorienting the goals of a global tax system \u2014 one designed by developed countries, but not working for developing States \u2014 is not a purely national exercise. She proposed a United Nations \u201cdebt workout\u201d mechanism that would make it possible to resolve debt crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development. She also discussed the need for a global mechanism that can address the transboundary impact of emerging technologies.</p><p>Ms. RINA said the patriarchal and militarized model of development is clearly not working. It must be replaced with people-centred development that addresses inequalities. Civil society is paving the way, driving regional engagement mechanisms with structures that ensure that grass\u2011roots voices are heard. Emphasizing that the text of the 2030 Agenda includes the term \u201cregional\u201d more than 30 times, she said regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons learned and identifying priorities and barriers. Citing examples in Latin America, she added that regional processes have great potential for charting ways to implement the Goals.</p><p>The representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group stated that more than 90 per cent of the Goals are linked to specific articles in international human rights instruments. Emphasizing the crucial role that national human rights institutions can play, she suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that addresses the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights.</p><p>The representative of the food and agriculture cluster of the non\u2011governmental organization major group said that, with global food insecurity on the rise, the world is far from achieving Goal 2 (zero hunger). Urging leaders to demonstrate political will, she said the right to food alone is not the solution to global hunger.</p><p>A representative of the women\u2019s major group from Latin America and the Caribbean said fundamental discussions on implementing the 2030 Agenda should take place at the national and regional levels \u201cbecause that is where the people are\u201d. She also noted the difficulty that Forum participants can face in obtaining visas and paying for airfare to attend its annual sessions. Another representative of the same major group, from Women Engage for a Common Future, said there is not enough critical analysis of human rights violations, especially violence against women. Voluntary national reviews should be discussed at regional forums with civil society providing alternative reports.</p><p>A representative of the African Regional Society stakeholder group said the integration of regional processes into the Forum\u2019s work must be strengthened, with more space allowed for regional voices.</p><p>Mr. GUTTIERES said 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality, but as the Forum heard today, there are still challenges to meaningful participation. Good examples are often exceptions, not the rule, he said. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he cautioned against becoming locked into a framework of passive dialogue. The Forum should rethink the way participation is carried out and address the factors that place the 2030 Agenda in jeopardy. Reaffirming commitments is not enough, he said, calling for redoubled efforts.</p><p>The representative of Norway said Governments bear the primary responsibility for delivering on the 2030 Agenda, but success depends on partnership with all stakeholders at all levels. Emphasizing that freedom of expression is an urgent priority for Norway, she expressed alarm at attacks on civil society, human rights and environmental rights defenders in many parts of the world. Civil society must have space to hold Governments to account, she said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved.\u201d</p><p>The representative of the workers and trade unions major group said voluntary national reviews often merely report progress on individual Goals without considering the linkages among them. Calling for dialogue, she warned that consultation and engagement are not synonyms, and that engagement cannot be a \u201ccheck-the-box exercise\u201d. The role of the private sector should not outweigh that of civil society, she said, and shadow reports from civil society groups should be published by Governments and the United Nations.</p><p>A representative of the major group for children and youth from Canada said she no longer wants to be part of the voluntary national review process. \u201cYou are leaving people behind [\u2026] because of your inaction,\u201d she said. Young people have potential and if Forum participants want to be included in their development efforts, they are welcome to join.</p><p>Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Azerbaijan, Kenya, Morocco, Mexico, Sweden, Guatemala and the Czech Republic.</p><p>Thematic Review II</p><p>The Forum then held a thematic review on the science-policy interface and heard a briefing from the independent group of scientists on the Global Sustainable Development Report. Moderated by Romain Murenzi, Executive Director, World Academy of Sciences, it featured presentations by Endah Murniningtyas, former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia, and Co-chair of the Global Sustainable Development Report; Peter Messerli, Director, Center for Development and Environment, University of Bern, Switzerland, and Co-chair of Global Sustainable Development Report; Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer, International Science Council; and Meera Joshi, former Commissioner, New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p><p>Stephan Contius, Commissioner, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany; and Virginia Murray, Head of Global Disaster Risk Reduction, Public Health England and member of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk scientific committee, served as lead discussants.</p><p>Mr. MURENZI said science, technology and innovations are essential to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Noting that the panel will examine ways for policymakers to open and amplify communication with the science community, as well as ways to ensure that messages received from the social and natural sciences are fully integrated into policies, he said it will also explore how the science community can become a more effective partner in carrying out the 2030 Agenda \u2014 specifically in terms of institutional structures, approaches and communication. It will also examine how the United Nations can increase engagement from science communities, funders, academia and the private sector.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI, noting that the independent group of scientists was mandated to produce the Global Sustainable Development Report, said the team worked on it over the past two and half years. After assessing and integrating feedback from Member States and other stakeholders, the report will be launched at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September. The report identifies targets that are on track to be achieved, as well as those that are off track. In some areas, results are going in the wrong direction, notably the areas of hunger, inequality and environment. The report also identifies trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed. It also provides a knowledge-based transformation framework consisting of four levers \u2014 governance; economy and finance; individual and collective action; and science and technology \u2014 as well as six entry points of transformation, namely: human well\u2011being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; energy decarbonization and access; food systems and nutrition patterns; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. He explained how this framework works in Nigeria around solar technology, addressing trade-offs and harnessing synergies among the Goals.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS stressed the importance of national context, as one country\u2019s situation is different from another\u2019s. The report identifies the role of science in informing policymaking, tracking progress and identifying countries and regions that need help. Noting that science can also identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, she said the report also highlights the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN highlighted achievements of the scientific community, including a report titled, \u201cThe Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges\u201d, prepared by The World in 2050 Initiative and published by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater, she said, underscoring the importance of knowledge-brokering capacity at the local and national levels. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, underscoring the power of partnerships among all stakeholders. She also drew attention to a global funding initiative for science.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. As Commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she set regulations for drivers, as the number of vehicle operators, such as yellow cabs and Uber cars, dramatically increased over a short period of time. It was critical to gather data, such as trip details, including where a ride started and ended, and how much drivers earned. Without data and data analytics, policies are based on public testimonies and anecdotes. Local governments will not know how to regulate if they lack information, she asserted, stressing that data helps decision makers devise better polices for residents.</p><p>Ms. MURRAY stressed the importance of implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a central element for achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is essential to strengthen the science-policy interface, as science and technology can empower stakeholders. Science can help define disaster hazards, she said, underscoring the need for a multisectoral approach to disaster risk management and for data to be usable for all stakeholders.</p><p>Mr. CONTIUS commended the report for outlining ways to accelerate transformation, mitigate trade-offs and harness synergies. It offers a good basis for discussion at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit and can inform integrated policy for lagging areas. He expressed hope that the next report, due in 2023, will reveal far more progress than today.</p><p>In the ensuing dialogue, the representative of France called for building scientific capacity in Africa to better understand such regional challenges as inequality and the effects of climate change. Official development assistance (ODA) should prioritize capacity\u2011building for scientific research institutions in the region.</p><p>The representative of Norway said science is at the heart of transformation, commending the group of experts for presenting a bold report. Success hinges on effective follow-up.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said the report provides valuable evidence\u2011based insights. It is now up to policymakers to make difficult choices. Underscoring that scientists and policymakers must engage, he said the political declaration for September\u2019s Summit should explicitly refer to the Global Sustainable Development Report.</p><p>The representative of Jamaica said data collection remains a challenge for small island developing States. She welcomed the diversity of the expert panel, as the specific needs of these countries must be considered.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS welcomed comments from the floor, noting that the panel will seek to incorporate suggestions into the final report.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI described access to data and knowledge as \u201chugely uneven\u201d, stressing the need to build knowledge platforms in developing countries through South-South and North-South cooperation. ODA can be used for that purpose.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN emphasized the need to link big data across all disciplines.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing examples, said data found that 96 per cent of taxi drivers made less than the minimum wage. Based on this finding, the local government set a new policy to support their business. Underscoring the need to secure data and protect privacy, she said data can improve the daily life in large cities.</p><p>The representative of the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities said that, as technologies address many barriers faced by this group, people with disabilities should be included in the development of technologies.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing an example, said that data had informed a policy devised in 2018 to enable people using wheelchairs to find a ride within 15 minutes.</p><p>The representative of the Dominican Republic pointed out that the science\u2011policy interface is not strong enough in some countries. Scientists need Government, and Government needs scientists.</p><p>The representative of the women\u2019s major group expressed concern about the public-private partnership model as corporate power has trampled human rights in Mongolia. The report also lacks gender and human rights perspectives.</p><p>The representative of the Republic of Korea said the report disproportionately focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainable development and expressed hope that the concluding chapter will be more evidence\u2011based. To strengthen the science\u2011policy interface, more scientists must be included in the preparation of United Nations reports. At the country level, the scientific community can be involved in monitoring and reviewing processes, such as that for the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20112024.</p><p>The representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Agency uses nuclear science and technology to advance sustainable development, including in the areas of agriculture, water, health and energy.</p><p>The representative of Ghana said his country has incorporated science, technology and innovation into its national development plan.</p><p>The representative of South Africa said his country has been addressing poverty and making the economy more competitive through science, technology and innovations, noting that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) listed South Africa among the world\u2019s innovation achievers in 2018.</p><p>The representative of the European Union welcomed the report, notably the knowledge-based transformation framework involving four levers and six entry points.</p><p>The representative of Sweden said his country supports research capacity in developing countries through restructured funding schemes and urged other Governments to do so.</p><p>The representative of Rwanda said innovation occurs in Africa, but is restricted by a lack of capacity, citing \u201cbrain drain\u201d. She asked panellists how science and research hubs can be created in developing countries.</p><p>The representative of the Bahamas said her country hosted a technology summit and revised immigration policy to attract science and technology professionals. Ongoing capacity\u2011building is critical.</p><p>The representative of Kenya said his country established a science, technology and innovation observatory.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI responded to the point about \u201cbrain drain\u201d by underscoring the difficulty of retaining talent in the public sector, as big tech companies offering higher salaries to attract job seekers. While at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she had sought to attract talent by offering them opportunities to work on big projects, travel and participate in training courses, as well as by appealing to their sense of public service.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI said the report is guided by the principle of \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d, including women and other marginalized groups. It focuses on three dimensions of sustainable development, he said, highlighting the critical relationship between people and nature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2182099I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-7F21-JDG9-Y0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons and identifying both priorities and barriers.</p><p>Panellist Donovan Guttieres, representing the major group for children and youth, said that, while 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality to the Forum, good examples of participation are more often the exception than the rule. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he said the Forum must rethink the way it fosters participation.</p><p>Panellist Pooja Rangaprasad, Director at the Society for International Development, focused on global democratic governance. She wondered whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations, recommending that the Organization establish a mechanism for resolving crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development.</p><p>In the ensuing discussions, representatives of Government, major groups and stakeholders agreed that civil society needs a bigger say in the Forum, with a speaker from the women's major group stressing that discussions should take place at the national and regional levels 'because that is where the people are'. A speaker from the indigenous peoples' major group likewise appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass roots consultations targeting those being left behind.</p><p>'We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,' said a representative of the major group for children and youth, who objected to civil society's tokenistic participation in the Forum. On that point, France's delegate said her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>Several speakers underscored the link between human rights and sustainable development, including the representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group, who suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that reflects the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights. Norway's delegate, expressing alarm at attacks on human rights and environmental rights defenders, said civil society must have space to hold Governments to account. 'It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved,' she said.</p><p>Also today, the Forum held a thematic review on the interface between science and policy that featured a briefing by the independent group of scientists preparing the Global Sustainable Development Report for release at the September Summit.</p><p>Report Co-Chair Peter Messerli of the Center for Development and Environment at the University of Bern said the report will identify targets that are on track to be achieved and those that not, citing hunger, inequality, environment as areas in which results are going in the wrong direction.

Her counterpart from Jamaica noted, however, that collecting data is a challenge for small island developing States.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Forum - meeting under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council on the theme 'Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality' - held a discussion on implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and between nations.</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will reconvene at noon on Friday, 12 July, to continue its work.</p><p>Thematic Discussion</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development began the day with a thematic discussion titled 'Perspectives of society', moderated by Katarina Popovic, Secretary General, International Council for Adult Education and Representative, education and academia stakeholder group to the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group; and Paola Simonetti, Deputy Director, Economic and Social Policy Department, International Trade Union Confederation and Co-Chair of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group. It featured presentations by Jose Viera, Chief Executive Officer, World Blind Union and Co Lead, Major Groups Task Group on High-Level Political Forum Reform; Pooja Rangaprasad, Director, Policy  and  Advocacy, Financing for Development, Society for International Development and Civil Society Financing for Development Group; Warda Rina, Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development, and Co-Chair, Asia Pacific Regional Civil Society Organizations Engagement Mechanism; and Donovan Guttieres, major group for children and youth.</p><p>KIRA CHRISTIANNE DANGANAN AZUCENA (Philippines), Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council, said the session would highlight the essential role that major groups and other stakeholders play in implementing and monitoring the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It would also hear about progress and challenges that various groups face in implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Ms. SIMONETTI said that, as the first phase of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals concludes, it is time to determine how the review process can be carried forward. During this session, major groups and other stakeholders - which have contributed to regional forums and national review mechanisms - can report on their contributions, and discuss whether the Forum is faithfully carrying out its mandate.</p><p>Mr. VIERA, outlining a set of principles to make the review process more democratic and productive, proposed greater emphasis on the inclusion of all groups, especially those most marginalized. Reform of the Forum should be based on results-oriented actions, an analysis of shortcomings and a determination of the systemic factors that lead to them. Participants must be more dynamic and not just congratulate themselves on what has been achieved. More resources should be made available to civil society, especially at the national level, while in the Forum, there must be more room for civil society to contribute. To exclude these principles from the Forum's reform would be to miss out on the many opportunities offered by the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>A representative of the children and youth major group from the Philippines, underscoring the need to step up stakeholder engagement, said that, in her region, many non-governmental organizations feel they are not part of the 2030 Agenda process. Having contributed to national review processes, they want feedback from Governments. 'We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,' she said, calling for an end to the tokenistic participation of civil society.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Rwanda said women and girls 'in all their diversity' must be at the heart of discussions. Noting that patriarchal systems limit choices, she called for greater investment in accessible, gender-responsive social services. For societies to be inclusive, and women and girls to be empowered, the broader system must be addressed, she added.</p><p>A representative of the indigenous people's major group said there is a huge gap in the participation and inclusion of indigenous peoples at the national level during preparations for voluntary national reviews. She appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass roots consultations targeting those being left behind. Noting that 92 per cent of the targets underpinning the Goals are linked to legally binding human rights instruments, she said the human rights obligations of States must be integrated into voluntary national reviews.</p><p>A representative of the Asia-Pacific Regional Civil Society Organization Engagement Mechanism drew attention to the situation of migrant female workers and called for the establishment of just, equitable and sustainable economies.</p><p>The representative of the Philippines said his country takes pride in its consultative processes when it prepares its voluntary national reviews. Such reviews are an opportunity to connect with stakeholders from different sectors and regions. He added that his country's reports are posted online for public comment and recommendations.</p><p>The representative of France said the Forum's wealth is based on the unique place it gives to civil society and the major groups. She added that her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the bloc considers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to be a shared responsibility that depends on the participation of all stakeholders.</p><p>The representative of Belgium drew attention to the absence of youth voices from the global South. The Goals are a worldwide story in which everyone - including young people - must have a say. 'We may not have decades of working experience, but that may be our strength,' she stated.</p><p>Ms. POPOVIC said the discussion would turn to ways of integrating cross cutting topics and thematic processes, such as development financing, food security and science, technology and innovation.</p><p>Ms. RANGAPRASAD said the key question is raising global democratic governance. Much is heard about illicit financial flows as a challenge to be addressed, but it is often packaged as a 'technical definition' issue when it is, in fact, a political question about whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Reorienting the goals of a global tax system - one designed by developed countries, but not working for developing States - is not a purely national exercise. She proposed a United Nations 'debt workout' mechanism that would make it possible to resolve debt crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development. She also discussed the need for a global mechanism that can address the transboundary impact of emerging technologies.</p><p>Ms. RINA said the patriarchal and militarized model of development is clearly not working. It must be replaced with people-centred development that addresses inequalities. Civil society is paving the way, driving regional engagement mechanisms with structures that ensure that grass roots voices are heard. Emphasizing that the text of the 2030 Agenda includes the term 'regional' more than 30 times, she said regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons learned and identifying priorities and barriers. Citing examples in Latin America, she added that regional processes have great potential for charting ways to implement the Goals.</p><p>The representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group stated that more than 90 per cent of the Goals are linked to specific articles in international human rights instruments. Emphasizing the crucial role that national human rights institutions can play, she suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that addresses the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights.</p><p>The representative of the food and agriculture cluster of the non governmental organization major group said that, with global food insecurity on the rise, the world is far from achieving Goal 2 (zero hunger). Urging leaders to demonstrate political will, she said the right to food alone is not the solution to global hunger.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Latin America and the Caribbean said fundamental discussions on implementing the 2030 Agenda should take place at the national and regional levels 'because that is where the people are'. She also noted the difficulty that Forum participants can face in obtaining visas and paying for airfare to attend its annual sessions. Another representative of the same major group, from Women Engage for a Common Future, said there is not enough critical analysis of human rights violations, especially violence against women. Voluntary national reviews should be discussed at regional forums with civil society providing alternative reports.</p><p>A representative of the African Regional Society stakeholder group said the integration of regional processes into the Forum's work must be strengthened, with more space allowed for regional voices.</p><p>Mr. GUTTIERES said 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality, but as the Forum heard today, there are still challenges to meaningful participation. Good examples are often exceptions, not the rule, he said. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he cautioned against becoming locked into a framework of passive dialogue. The Forum should rethink the way participation is carried out and address the factors that place the 2030 Agenda in jeopardy. Reaffirming commitments is not enough, he said, calling for redoubled efforts.</p><p>The representative of Norway said Governments bear the primary responsibility for delivering on the 2030 Agenda, but success depends on partnership with all stakeholders at all levels. Emphasizing that freedom of expression is an urgent priority for Norway, she expressed alarm at attacks on civil society, human rights and environmental rights defenders in many parts of the world. Civil society must have space to hold Governments to account, she said, adding: 'It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved.'</p><p>The representative of the workers and trade unions major group said voluntary national reviews often merely report progress on individual Goals without considering the linkages among them. Calling for dialogue, she warned that consultation and engagement are not synonyms, and that engagement cannot be a 'check-the-box exercise'. The role of the private sector should not outweigh that of civil society, she said, and shadow reports from civil society groups should be published by Governments and the United Nations.</p><p>A representative of the major group for children and youth from Canada said she no longer wants to be part of the voluntary national review process. 'You are leaving people behind [\u2026] because of your inaction,' she said. Young people have potential and if Forum participants want to be included in their development efforts, they are welcome to join.</p><p>Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Azerbaijan, Kenya, Morocco, Mexico, Sweden, Guatemala and the Czech Republic.</p><p>Thematic Review II</p><p>The Forum then held a thematic review on the science-policy interface and heard a briefing from the independent group of scientists on the Global Sustainable Development Report. Moderated by Romain Murenzi, Executive Director, World Academy of Sciences, it featured presentations by Endah Murniningtyas, former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia, and Co-chair of the Global Sustainable Development Report; Peter Messerli, Director, Center for Development and Environment, University of Bern, Switzerland, and Co-chair of Global Sustainable Development Report; Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer, International Science Council; and Meera Joshi, former Commissioner, New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p><p>Stephan Contius, Commissioner, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany; and Virginia Murray, Head of Global Disaster Risk Reduction, Public Health England and member of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk scientific committee, served as lead discussants.</p><p>Mr. MURENZI said science, technology and innovations are essential to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Noting that the panel will examine ways for policymakers to open and amplify communication with the science community, as well as ways to ensure that messages received from the social and natural sciences are fully integrated into policies, he said it will also explore how the science community can become a more effective partner in carrying out the 2030 Agenda - specifically in terms of institutional structures, approaches and communication. It will also examine how the United Nations can increase engagement from science communities, funders, academia and the private sector.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI, noting that the independent group of scientists was mandated to produce the Global Sustainable Development Report, said the team worked on it over the past two and half years. After assessing and integrating feedback from Member States and other stakeholders, the report will be launched at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September. The report identifies targets that are on track to be achieved, as well as those that are off track. In some areas, results are going in the wrong direction, notably the areas of hunger, inequality and environment. The report also identifies trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed. It also provides a knowledge-based transformation framework consisting of four levers - governance; economy and finance; individual and collective action; and science and technology - as well as six entry points of transformation, namely: human well being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; energy decarbonization and access; food systems and nutrition patterns; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. He explained how this framework works in Nigeria around solar technology, addressing trade-offs and harnessing synergies among the Goals.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS stressed the importance of national context, as one country's situation is different from another's. The report identifies the role of science in informing policymaking, tracking progress and identifying countries and regions that need help. Noting that science can also identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, she said the report also highlights the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN highlighted achievements of the scientific community, including a report titled, 'The Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges', prepared by The World in 2050 Initiative and published by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater, she said, underscoring the importance of knowledge-brokering capacity at the local and national levels. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, underscoring the power of partnerships among all stakeholders. She also drew attention to a global funding initiative for science.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. As Commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she set regulations for drivers, as the number of vehicle operators, such as yellow cabs and Uber cars, dramatically increased over a short period of time. It was critical to gather data, such as trip details, including where a ride started and ended, and how much drivers earned. Without data and data analytics, policies are based on public testimonies and anecdotes. Local governments will not know how to regulate if they lack information, she asserted, stressing that data helps decision makers devise better polices for residents.</p><p>Ms. MURRAY stressed the importance of implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a central element for achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is essential to strengthen the science-policy interface, as science and technology can empower stakeholders. Science can help define disaster hazards, she said, underscoring the need for a multisectoral approach to disaster risk management and for data to be usable for all stakeholders.</p><p>Mr. CONTIUS commended the report for outlining ways to accelerate transformation, mitigate trade-offs and harness synergies. It offers a good basis for discussion at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit and can inform integrated policy for lagging areas. He expressed hope that the next report, due in 2023, will reveal far more progress than today.</p><p>In the ensuing dialogue, the representative of France called for building scientific capacity in Africa to better understand such regional challenges as inequality and the effects of climate change. Official development assistance (ODA) should prioritize capacity building for scientific research institutions in the region.</p><p>The representative of Norway said science is at the heart of transformation, commending the group of experts for presenting a bold report. Success hinges on effective follow-up.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said the report provides valuable evidence based insights. It is now up to policymakers to make difficult choices. Underscoring that scientists and policymakers must engage, he said the political declaration for September's Summit should explicitly refer to the Global Sustainable Development Report.</p><p>The representative of Jamaica said data collection remains a challenge for small island developing States. She welcomed the diversity of the expert panel, as the specific needs of these countries must be considered.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS welcomed comments from the floor, noting that the panel will seek to incorporate suggestions into the final report.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI described access to data and knowledge as 'hugely uneven', stressing the need to build knowledge platforms in developing countries through South-South and North-South cooperation. ODA can be used for that purpose.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN emphasized the need to link big data across all disciplines.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing examples, said data found that 96 per cent of taxi drivers made less than the minimum wage. Based on this finding, the local government set a new policy to support their business. Underscoring the need to secure data and protect privacy, she said data can improve the daily life in large cities.</p><p>The representative of the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities said that, as technologies address many barriers faced by this group, people with disabilities should be included in the development of technologies.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing an example, said that data had informed a policy devised in 2018 to enable people using wheelchairs to find a ride within 15 minutes.</p><p>The representative of the Dominican Republic pointed out that the science policy interface is not strong enough in some countries. Scientists need Government, and Government needs scientists.</p><p>The representative of the women's major group expressed concern about the public-private partnership model as corporate power has trampled human rights in Mongolia. The report also lacks gender and human rights perspectives.</p><p>The representative of the Republic of Korea said the report disproportionately focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainable development and expressed hope that the concluding chapter will be more evidence based. To strengthen the science policy interface, more scientists must be included in the preparation of United Nations reports. At the country level, the scientific community can be involved in monitoring and reviewing processes, such as that for the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014 2024.</p><p>The representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Agency uses nuclear science and technology to advance sustainable development, including in the areas of agriculture, water, health and energy.</p><p>The representative of Ghana said his country has incorporated science, technology and innovation into its national development plan.</p><p>The representative of South Africa said his country has been addressing poverty and making the economy more competitive through science, technology and innovations, noting that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) listed South Africa among the world's innovation achievers in 2018.</p><p>The representative of the European Union welcomed the report, notably the knowledge-based transformation framework involving four levers and six entry points.</p><p>The representative of Sweden said his country supports research capacity in developing countries through restructured funding schemes and urged other Governments to do so.</p><p>The representative of Rwanda said innovation occurs in Africa, but is restricted by a lack of capacity, citing 'brain drain'. She asked panellists how science and research hubs can be created in developing countries.</p><p>The representative of the Bahamas said her country hosted a technology summit and revised immigration policy to attract science and technology professionals. Ongoing capacity building is critical.</p><p>The representative of Kenya said his country established a science, technology and innovation observatory.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI responded to the point about 'brain drain' by underscoring the difficulty of retaining talent in the public sector, as big tech companies offering higher salaries to attract job seekers. While at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she had sought to attract talent by offering them opportunities to work on big projects, travel and participate in training courses, as well as by appealing to their sense of public service.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI said the report is guided by the principle of 'leaving no one behind', including women and other marginalized groups. It focuses on three dimensions of sustainable development, he said, highlighting the critical relationship between people and nature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG1107201900003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-V8Y1-F00C-60SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ASIA PACIFIC FORUM ON WOMEN LAW &amp;

Regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons and identifying both priorities and barriers.</p><p>Panellist Donovan Guttieres, representing the major group for children and youth, said that, while 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality to the Forum, good examples of participation are more often the exception than the rule. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he said the Forum must rethink the way it fosters participation.</p><p>Panellist Pooja Rangaprasad, Director at the Society for International Development, focused on global democratic governance. She wondered whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations, recommending that the Organization establish a mechanism for resolving crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development.</p><p>In the ensuing discussions, representatives of Government, major groups and stakeholders agreed that civil society needs a bigger say in the Forum, with a speaker from the women's major group stressing that discussions should take place at the national and regional levels 'because that is where the people are'. A speaker from the indigenous peoples' major group likewise appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass roots consultations targeting those being left behind.</p><p>'We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,' said a representative of the major group for children and youth, who objected to civil society's tokenistic participation in the Forum. On that point, France's delegate said her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>Several speakers underscored the link between human rights and sustainable development, including the representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group, who suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that reflects the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights. Norway's delegate, expressing alarm at attacks on human rights and environmental rights defenders, said civil society must have space to hold Governments to account. 'It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved,' she said.</p><p>Also today, the Forum held a thematic review on the interface between science and policy that featured a briefing by the independent group of scientists preparing the Global Sustainable Development Report for release at the September Summit.</p><p>Report Co-Chair Peter Messerli of the Center for Development and Environment at the University of Bern said the report will identify targets that are on track to be achieved and those that not, citing hunger, inequality, environment as areas in which results are going in the wrong direction. The report will also pinpoint trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed, he said.</p><p>Noting that science can identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, co-chair Endah Murniningtyas, Indonesia's former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, said the report will highlight the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Panellist Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer of the International Science Council, said scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, drawing attention to a global science funding initiative.</p><p>Panellist Meera Joshi, former head of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. Citing her experience overseeing yellow cabs and Uber cars, she stressed the importance for policies to be based on data, not anecdotes.</p><p>When the floor opened for discussion, France's representative stressed the need to build science capacity in Africa to better understand its challenges, including inequality and effects of climate change. Her counterpart from Jamaica noted, however, that collecting data is a challenge for small island developing States.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Forum - meeting under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council on the theme 'Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality' - held a discussion on implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and between nations.</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will reconvene at noon on Friday, 12 July, to continue its work.</p><p>Thematic Discussion</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development began the day with a thematic discussion titled 'Perspectives of society', moderated by Katarina Popovic, Secretary General, International Council for Adult Education and Representative, education and academia stakeholder group to the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group; and Paola Simonetti, Deputy Director, Economic and Social Policy Department, International Trade Union Confederation and Co-Chair of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group. It featured presentations by Jose Viera, Chief Executive Officer, World Blind Union and Co Lead, Major Groups Task Group on High-Level Political Forum Reform; Pooja Rangaprasad, Director, Policy  and  Advocacy, Financing for Development, Society for International Development and Civil Society Financing for Development Group; Warda Rina, Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development, and Co-Chair, Asia Pacific Regional Civil Society Organizations Engagement Mechanism; and Donovan Guttieres, major group for children and youth.</p><p>KIRA CHRISTIANNE DANGANAN AZUCENA (Philippines), Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council, said the session would highlight the essential role that major groups and other stakeholders play in implementing and monitoring the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It would also hear about progress and challenges that various groups face in implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Ms. SIMONETTI said that, as the first phase of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals concludes, it is time to determine how the review process can be carried forward. During this session, major groups and other stakeholders - which have contributed to regional forums and national review mechanisms - can report on their contributions, and discuss whether the Forum is faithfully carrying out its mandate.</p><p>Mr. VIERA, outlining a set of principles to make the review process more democratic and productive, proposed greater emphasis on the inclusion of all groups, especially those most marginalized. Reform of the Forum should be based on results-oriented actions, an analysis of shortcomings and a determination of the systemic factors that lead to them. Participants must be more dynamic and not just congratulate themselves on what has been achieved. More resources should be made available to civil society, especially at the national level, while in the Forum, there must be more room for civil society to contribute. To exclude these principles from the Forum's reform would be to miss out on the many opportunities offered by the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>A representative of the children and youth major group from the Philippines, underscoring the need to step up stakeholder engagement, said that, in her region, many non-governmental organizations feel they are not part of the 2030 Agenda process. Having contributed to national review processes, they want feedback from Governments. 'We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,' she said, calling for an end to the tokenistic participation of civil society.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Rwanda said women and girls 'in all their diversity' must be at the heart of discussions. Noting that patriarchal systems limit choices, she called for greater investment in accessible, gender-responsive social services. For societies to be inclusive, and women and girls to be empowered, the broader system must be addressed, she added.</p><p>A representative of the indigenous people's major group said there is a huge gap in the participation and inclusion of indigenous peoples at the national level during preparations for voluntary national reviews. She appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass roots consultations targeting those being left behind. Noting that 92 per cent of the targets underpinning the Goals are linked to legally binding human rights instruments, she said the human rights obligations of States must be integrated into voluntary national reviews.</p><p>A representative of the Asia-Pacific Regional Civil Society Organization Engagement Mechanism drew attention to the situation of migrant female workers and called for the establishment of just, equitable and sustainable economies.</p><p>The representative of the Philippines said his country takes pride in its consultative processes when it prepares its voluntary national reviews. Such reviews are an opportunity to connect with stakeholders from different sectors and regions. He added that his country's reports are posted online for public comment and recommendations.</p><p>The representative of France said the Forum's wealth is based on the unique place it gives to civil society and the major groups. She added that her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the bloc considers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to be a shared responsibility that depends on the participation of all stakeholders.</p><p>The representative of Belgium drew attention to the absence of youth voices from the global South. The Goals are a worldwide story in which everyone - including young people - must have a say. 'We may not have decades of working experience, but that may be our strength,' she stated.</p><p>Ms. POPOVIC said the discussion would turn to ways of integrating cross cutting topics and thematic processes, such as development financing, food security and science, technology and innovation.</p><p>Ms. RANGAPRASAD said the key question is raising global democratic governance. Much is heard about illicit financial flows as a challenge to be addressed, but it is often packaged as a 'technical definition' issue when it is, in fact, a political question about whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Reorienting the goals of a global tax system - one designed by developed countries, but not working for developing States - is not a purely national exercise. She proposed a United Nations 'debt workout' mechanism that would make it possible to resolve debt crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development. She also discussed the need for a global mechanism that can address the transboundary impact of emerging technologies.</p><p>Ms. RINA said the patriarchal and militarized model of development is clearly not working. It must be replaced with people-centred development that addresses inequalities. Civil society is paving the way, driving regional engagement mechanisms with structures that ensure that grass roots voices are heard. Emphasizing that the text of the 2030 Agenda includes the term 'regional' more than 30 times, she said regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons learned and identifying priorities and barriers. Citing examples in Latin America, she added that regional processes have great potential for charting ways to implement the Goals.</p><p>The representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group stated that more than 90 per cent of the Goals are linked to specific articles in international human rights instruments. Emphasizing the crucial role that national human rights institutions can play, she suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that addresses the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights.</p><p>The representative of the food and agriculture cluster of the non governmental organization major group said that, with global food insecurity on the rise, the world is far from achieving Goal 2 (zero hunger). Urging leaders to demonstrate political will, she said the right to food alone is not the solution to global hunger.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Latin America and the Caribbean said fundamental discussions on implementing the 2030 Agenda should take place at the national and regional levels 'because that is where the people are'. She also noted the difficulty that Forum participants can face in obtaining visas and paying for airfare to attend its annual sessions. Another representative of the same major group, from Women Engage for a Common Future, said there is not enough critical analysis of human rights violations, especially violence against women. Voluntary national reviews should be discussed at regional forums with civil society providing alternative reports.</p><p>A representative of the African Regional Society stakeholder group said the integration of regional processes into the Forum's work must be strengthened, with more space allowed for regional voices.</p><p>Mr. GUTTIERES said 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality, but as the Forum heard today, there are still challenges to meaningful participation. Good examples are often exceptions, not the rule, he said. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he cautioned against becoming locked into a framework of passive dialogue. The Forum should rethink the way participation is carried out and address the factors that place the 2030 Agenda in jeopardy. Reaffirming commitments is not enough, he said, calling for redoubled efforts.</p><p>The representative of Norway said Governments bear the primary responsibility for delivering on the 2030 Agenda, but success depends on partnership with all stakeholders at all levels. Emphasizing that freedom of expression is an urgent priority for Norway, she expressed alarm at attacks on civil society, human rights and environmental rights defenders in many parts of the world. Civil society must have space to hold Governments to account, she said, adding: 'It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved.'</p><p>The representative of the workers and trade unions major group said voluntary national reviews often merely report progress on individual Goals without considering the linkages among them. Calling for dialogue, she warned that consultation and engagement are not synonyms, and that engagement cannot be a 'check-the-box exercise'. The role of the private sector should not outweigh that of civil society, she said, and shadow reports from civil society groups should be published by Governments and the United Nations.</p><p>A representative of the major group for children and youth from Canada said she no longer wants to be part of the voluntary national review process. 'You are leaving people behind [\u2026] because of your inaction,' she said. Young people have potential and if Forum participants want to be included in their development efforts, they are welcome to join.</p><p>Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Azerbaijan, Kenya, Morocco, Mexico, Sweden, Guatemala and the Czech Republic.</p><p>Thematic Review II</p><p>The Forum then held a thematic review on the science-policy interface and heard a briefing from the independent group of scientists on the Global Sustainable Development Report. Moderated by Romain Murenzi, Executive Director, World Academy of Sciences, it featured presentations by Endah Murniningtyas, former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia, and Co-chair of the Global Sustainable Development Report; Peter Messerli, Director, Center for Development and Environment, University of Bern, Switzerland, and Co-chair of Global Sustainable Development Report; Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer, International Science Council; and Meera Joshi, former Commissioner, New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p><p>Stephan Contius, Commissioner, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany; and Virginia Murray, Head of Global Disaster Risk Reduction, Public Health England and member of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk scientific committee, served as lead discussants.</p><p>Mr. MURENZI said science, technology and innovations are essential to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Noting that the panel will examine ways for policymakers to open and amplify communication with the science community, as well as ways to ensure that messages received from the social and natural sciences are fully integrated into policies, he said it will also explore how the science community can become a more effective partner in carrying out the 2030 Agenda - specifically in terms of institutional structures, approaches and communication. It will also examine how the United Nations can increase engagement from science communities, funders, academia and the private sector.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI, noting that the independent group of scientists was mandated to produce the Global Sustainable Development Report, said the team worked on it over the past two and half years. After assessing and integrating feedback from Member States and other stakeholders, the report will be launched at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September. The report identifies targets that are on track to be achieved, as well as those that are off track. In some areas, results are going in the wrong direction, notably the areas of hunger, inequality and environment. The report also identifies trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed. It also provides a knowledge-based transformation framework consisting of four levers - governance; economy and finance; individual and collective action; and science and technology - as well as six entry points of transformation, namely: human well being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; energy decarbonization and access; food systems and nutrition patterns; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. He explained how this framework works in Nigeria around solar technology, addressing trade-offs and harnessing synergies among the Goals.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS stressed the importance of national context, as one country's situation is different from another's. The report identifies the role of science in informing policymaking, tracking progress and identifying countries and regions that need help. Noting that science can also identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, she said the report also highlights the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN highlighted achievements of the scientific community, including a report titled, 'The Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges', prepared by The World in 2050 Initiative and published by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater, she said, underscoring the importance of knowledge-brokering capacity at the local and national levels. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, underscoring the power of partnerships among all stakeholders. She also drew attention to a global funding initiative for science.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. As Commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she set regulations for drivers, as the number of vehicle operators, such as yellow cabs and Uber cars, dramatically increased over a short period of time. It was critical to gather data, such as trip details, including where a ride started and ended, and how much drivers earned. Without data and data analytics, policies are based on public testimonies and anecdotes. Local governments will not know how to regulate if they lack information, she asserted, stressing that data helps decision makers devise better polices for residents.</p><p>Ms. MURRAY stressed the importance of implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a central element for achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is essential to strengthen the science-policy interface, as science and technology can empower stakeholders. Science can help define disaster hazards, she said, underscoring the need for a multisectoral approach to disaster risk management and for data to be usable for all stakeholders.</p><p>Mr. CONTIUS commended the report for outlining ways to accelerate transformation, mitigate trade-offs and harness synergies. It offers a good basis for discussion at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit and can inform integrated policy for lagging areas. He expressed hope that the next report, due in 2023, will reveal far more progress than today.</p><p>In the ensuing dialogue, the representative of France called for building scientific capacity in Africa to better understand such regional challenges as inequality and the effects of climate change. Official development assistance (ODA) should prioritize capacity building for scientific research institutions in the region.</p><p>The representative of Norway said science is at the heart of transformation, commending the group of experts for presenting a bold report. Success hinges on effective follow-up.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said the report provides valuable evidence based insights. It is now up to policymakers to make difficult choices. Underscoring that scientists and policymakers must engage, he said the political declaration for September's Summit should explicitly refer to the Global Sustainable Development Report.</p><p>The representative of Jamaica said data collection remains a challenge for small island developing States. She welcomed the diversity of the expert panel, as the specific needs of these countries must be considered.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS welcomed comments from the floor, noting that the panel will seek to incorporate suggestions into the final report.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI described access to data and knowledge as 'hugely uneven', stressing the need to build knowledge platforms in developing countries through South-South and North-South cooperation. ODA can be used for that purpose.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN emphasized the need to link big data across all disciplines.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing examples, said data found that 96 per cent of taxi drivers made less than the minimum wage. Based on this finding, the local government set a new policy to support their business. Underscoring the need to secure data and protect privacy, she said data can improve the daily life in large cities.</p><p>The representative of the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities said that, as technologies address many barriers faced by this group, people with disabilities should be included in the development of technologies.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing an example, said that data had informed a policy devised in 2018 to enable people using wheelchairs to find a ride within 15 minutes.</p><p>The representative of the Dominican Republic pointed out that the science policy interface is not strong enough in some countries. Scientists need Government, and Government needs scientists.</p><p>The representative of the women's major group expressed concern about the public-private partnership model as corporate power has trampled human rights in Mongolia. The report also lacks gender and human rights perspectives.</p><p>The representative of the Republic of Korea said the report disproportionately focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainable development and expressed hope that the concluding chapter will be more evidence based. To strengthen the science policy interface, more scientists must be included in the preparation of United Nations reports. At the country level, the scientific community can be involved in monitoring and reviewing processes, such as that for the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014 2024.</p><p>The representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Agency uses nuclear science and technology to advance sustainable development, including in the areas of agriculture, water, health and energy.</p><p>The representative of Ghana said his country has incorporated science, technology and innovation into its national development plan.</p><p>The representative of South Africa said his country has been addressing poverty and making the economy more competitive through science, technology and innovations, noting that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) listed South Africa among the world's innovation achievers in 2018.</p><p>The representative of the European Union welcomed the report, notably the knowledge-based transformation framework involving four levers and six entry points.</p><p>The representative of Sweden said his country supports research capacity in developing countries through restructured funding schemes and urged other Governments to do so.</p><p>The representative of Rwanda said innovation occurs in Africa, but is restricted by a lack of capacity, citing 'brain drain'. She asked panellists how science and research hubs can be created in developing countries.</p><p>The representative of the Bahamas said her country hosted a technology summit and revised immigration policy to attract science and technology professionals. Ongoing capacity building is critical.</p><p>The representative of Kenya said his country established a science, technology and innovation observatory.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI responded to the point about 'brain drain' by underscoring the difficulty of retaining talent in the public sector, as big tech companies offering higher salaries to attract job seekers. While at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she had sought to attract talent by offering them opportunities to work on big projects, travel and participate in training courses, as well as by appealing to their sense of public service.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI said the report is guided by the principle of 'leaving no one behind', including women and other marginalized groups. It focuses on three dimensions of sustainable development, he said, highlighting the critical relationship between people and nature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AZNEGA-AZERNEWSG1107201900035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AZNEGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-V8X1-F00C-6471-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434093</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Azerbaijan News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Azerbaijan News Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ASIA PACIFIC FORUM ON WOMEN LAW &amp;

Regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons and identifying both priorities and barriers.</p><p>Panellist Donovan Guttieres, representing the major group for children and youth, said that, while 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality to the Forum, good examples of participation are more often the exception than the rule. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he said the Forum must rethink the way it fosters participation.</p><p>Panellist Pooja Rangaprasad, Director at the Society for International Development, focused on global democratic governance. She wondered whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations, recommending that the Organization establish a mechanism for resolving crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development.</p><p>In the ensuing discussions, representatives of Government, major groups and stakeholders agreed that civil society needs a bigger say in the Forum, with a speaker from the women's major group stressing that discussions should take place at the national and regional levels 'because that is where the people are'. A speaker from the indigenous peoples' major group likewise appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass roots consultations targeting those being left behind.</p><p>'We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,' said a representative of the major group for children and youth, who objected to civil society's tokenistic participation in the Forum. On that point, France's delegate said her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>Several speakers underscored the link between human rights and sustainable development, including the representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group, who suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that reflects the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights. Norway's delegate, expressing alarm at attacks on human rights and environmental rights defenders, said civil society must have space to hold Governments to account. 'It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved,' she said.</p><p>Also today, the Forum held a thematic review on the interface between science and policy that featured a briefing by the independent group of scientists preparing the Global Sustainable Development Report for release at the September Summit.</p><p>Report Co-Chair Peter Messerli of the Center for Development and Environment at the University of Bern said the report will identify targets that are on track to be achieved and those that not, citing hunger, inequality, environment as areas in which results are going in the wrong direction. The report will also pinpoint trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed, he said.</p><p>Noting that science can identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, co-chair Endah Murniningtyas, Indonesia's former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, said the report will highlight the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Panellist Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer of the International Science Council, said scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, drawing attention to a global science funding initiative.</p><p>Panellist Meera Joshi, former head of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. Citing her experience overseeing yellow cabs and Uber cars, she stressed the importance for policies to be based on data, not anecdotes.</p><p>When the floor opened for discussion, France's representative stressed the need to build science capacity in Africa to better understand its challenges, including inequality and effects of climate change. Her counterpart from Jamaica noted, however, that collecting data is a challenge for small island developing States.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Forum - meeting under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council on the theme 'Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality' - held a discussion on implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and between nations.</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will reconvene at noon on Friday, 12 July, to continue its work.</p><p>Thematic Discussion</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development began the day with a thematic discussion titled 'Perspectives of society', moderated by Katarina Popovic, Secretary General, International Council for Adult Education and Representative, education and academia stakeholder group to the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group; and Paola Simonetti, Deputy Director, Economic and Social Policy Department, International Trade Union Confederation and Co-Chair of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group. It featured presentations by Jose Viera, Chief Executive Officer, World Blind Union and Co Lead, Major Groups Task Group on High-Level Political Forum Reform; Pooja Rangaprasad, Director, Policy  and  Advocacy, Financing for Development, Society for International Development and Civil Society Financing for Development Group; Warda Rina, Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development, and Co-Chair, Asia Pacific Regional Civil Society Organizations Engagement Mechanism; and Donovan Guttieres, major group for children and youth.</p><p>KIRA CHRISTIANNE DANGANAN AZUCENA (Philippines), Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council, said the session would highlight the essential role that major groups and other stakeholders play in implementing and monitoring the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It would also hear about progress and challenges that various groups face in implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Ms. SIMONETTI said that, as the first phase of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals concludes, it is time to determine how the review process can be carried forward. During this session, major groups and other stakeholders - which have contributed to regional forums and national review mechanisms - can report on their contributions, and discuss whether the Forum is faithfully carrying out its mandate.</p><p>Mr. VIERA, outlining a set of principles to make the review process more democratic and productive, proposed greater emphasis on the inclusion of all groups, especially those most marginalized. Reform of the Forum should be based on results-oriented actions, an analysis of shortcomings and a determination of the systemic factors that lead to them. Participants must be more dynamic and not just congratulate themselves on what has been achieved. More resources should be made available to civil society, especially at the national level, while in the Forum, there must be more room for civil society to contribute. To exclude these principles from the Forum's reform would be to miss out on the many opportunities offered by the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>A representative of the children and youth major group from the Philippines, underscoring the need to step up stakeholder engagement, said that, in her region, many non-governmental organizations feel they are not part of the 2030 Agenda process. Having contributed to national review processes, they want feedback from Governments. 'We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,' she said, calling for an end to the tokenistic participation of civil society.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Rwanda said women and girls 'in all their diversity' must be at the heart of discussions. Noting that patriarchal systems limit choices, she called for greater investment in accessible, gender-responsive social services. For societies to be inclusive, and women and girls to be empowered, the broader system must be addressed, she added.</p><p>A representative of the indigenous people's major group said there is a huge gap in the participation and inclusion of indigenous peoples at the national level during preparations for voluntary national reviews. She appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass roots consultations targeting those being left behind. Noting that 92 per cent of the targets underpinning the Goals are linked to legally binding human rights instruments, she said the human rights obligations of States must be integrated into voluntary national reviews.</p><p>A representative of the Asia-Pacific Regional Civil Society Organization Engagement Mechanism drew attention to the situation of migrant female workers and called for the establishment of just, equitable and sustainable economies.</p><p>The representative of the Philippines said his country takes pride in its consultative processes when it prepares its voluntary national reviews. Such reviews are an opportunity to connect with stakeholders from different sectors and regions. He added that his country's reports are posted online for public comment and recommendations.</p><p>The representative of France said the Forum's wealth is based on the unique place it gives to civil society and the major groups. She added that her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the bloc considers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to be a shared responsibility that depends on the participation of all stakeholders.</p><p>The representative of Belgium drew attention to the absence of youth voices from the global South. The Goals are a worldwide story in which everyone - including young people - must have a say. 'We may not have decades of working experience, but that may be our strength,' she stated.</p><p>Ms. POPOVIC said the discussion would turn to ways of integrating cross cutting topics and thematic processes, such as development financing, food security and science, technology and innovation.</p><p>Ms. RANGAPRASAD said the key question is raising global democratic governance. Much is heard about illicit financial flows as a challenge to be addressed, but it is often packaged as a 'technical definition' issue when it is, in fact, a political question about whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Reorienting the goals of a global tax system - one designed by developed countries, but not working for developing States - is not a purely national exercise. She proposed a United Nations 'debt workout' mechanism that would make it possible to resolve debt crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development. She also discussed the need for a global mechanism that can address the transboundary impact of emerging technologies.</p><p>Ms. RINA said the patriarchal and militarized model of development is clearly not working. It must be replaced with people-centred development that addresses inequalities. Civil society is paving the way, driving regional engagement mechanisms with structures that ensure that grass roots voices are heard. Emphasizing that the text of the 2030 Agenda includes the term 'regional' more than 30 times, she said regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons learned and identifying priorities and barriers. Citing examples in Latin America, she added that regional processes have great potential for charting ways to implement the Goals.</p><p>The representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group stated that more than 90 per cent of the Goals are linked to specific articles in international human rights instruments. Emphasizing the crucial role that national human rights institutions can play, she suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that addresses the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights.</p><p>The representative of the food and agriculture cluster of the non governmental organization major group said that, with global food insecurity on the rise, the world is far from achieving Goal 2 (zero hunger). Urging leaders to demonstrate political will, she said the right to food alone is not the solution to global hunger.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Latin America and the Caribbean said fundamental discussions on implementing the 2030 Agenda should take place at the national and regional levels 'because that is where the people are'. She also noted the difficulty that Forum participants can face in obtaining visas and paying for airfare to attend its annual sessions. Another representative of the same major group, from Women Engage for a Common Future, said there is not enough critical analysis of human rights violations, especially violence against women. Voluntary national reviews should be discussed at regional forums with civil society providing alternative reports.</p><p>A representative of the African Regional Society stakeholder group said the integration of regional processes into the Forum's work must be strengthened, with more space allowed for regional voices.</p><p>Mr. GUTTIERES said 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality, but as the Forum heard today, there are still challenges to meaningful participation. Good examples are often exceptions, not the rule, he said. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he cautioned against becoming locked into a framework of passive dialogue. The Forum should rethink the way participation is carried out and address the factors that place the 2030 Agenda in jeopardy. Reaffirming commitments is not enough, he said, calling for redoubled efforts.</p><p>The representative of Norway said Governments bear the primary responsibility for delivering on the 2030 Agenda, but success depends on partnership with all stakeholders at all levels. Emphasizing that freedom of expression is an urgent priority for Norway, she expressed alarm at attacks on civil society, human rights and environmental rights defenders in many parts of the world. Civil society must have space to hold Governments to account, she said, adding: 'It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved.'</p><p>The representative of the workers and trade unions major group said voluntary national reviews often merely report progress on individual Goals without considering the linkages among them. Calling for dialogue, she warned that consultation and engagement are not synonyms, and that engagement cannot be a 'check-the-box exercise'. The role of the private sector should not outweigh that of civil society, she said, and shadow reports from civil society groups should be published by Governments and the United Nations.</p><p>A representative of the major group for children and youth from Canada said she no longer wants to be part of the voluntary national review process. 'You are leaving people behind [\u2026] because of your inaction,' she said. Young people have potential and if Forum participants want to be included in their development efforts, they are welcome to join.</p><p>Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Azerbaijan, Kenya, Morocco, Mexico, Sweden, Guatemala and the Czech Republic.</p><p>Thematic Review II</p><p>The Forum then held a thematic review on the science-policy interface and heard a briefing from the independent group of scientists on the Global Sustainable Development Report. Moderated by Romain Murenzi, Executive Director, World Academy of Sciences, it featured presentations by Endah Murniningtyas, former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia, and Co-chair of the Global Sustainable Development Report; Peter Messerli, Director, Center for Development and Environment, University of Bern, Switzerland, and Co-chair of Global Sustainable Development Report; Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer, International Science Council; and Meera Joshi, former Commissioner, New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p><p>Stephan Contius, Commissioner, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany; and Virginia Murray, Head of Global Disaster Risk Reduction, Public Health England and member of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk scientific committee, served as lead discussants.</p><p>Mr. MURENZI said science, technology and innovations are essential to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Noting that the panel will examine ways for policymakers to open and amplify communication with the science community, as well as ways to ensure that messages received from the social and natural sciences are fully integrated into policies, he said it will also explore how the science community can become a more effective partner in carrying out the 2030 Agenda - specifically in terms of institutional structures, approaches and communication. It will also examine how the United Nations can increase engagement from science communities, funders, academia and the private sector.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI, noting that the independent group of scientists was mandated to produce the Global Sustainable Development Report, said the team worked on it over the past two and half years. After assessing and integrating feedback from Member States and other stakeholders, the report will be launched at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September. The report identifies targets that are on track to be achieved, as well as those that are off track. In some areas, results are going in the wrong direction, notably the areas of hunger, inequality and environment. The report also identifies trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed. It also provides a knowledge-based transformation framework consisting of four levers - governance; economy and finance; individual and collective action; and science and technology - as well as six entry points of transformation, namely: human well being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; energy decarbonization and access; food systems and nutrition patterns; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. He explained how this framework works in Nigeria around solar technology, addressing trade-offs and harnessing synergies among the Goals.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS stressed the importance of national context, as one country's situation is different from another's. The report identifies the role of science in informing policymaking, tracking progress and identifying countries and regions that need help. Noting that science can also identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, she said the report also highlights the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN highlighted achievements of the scientific community, including a report titled, 'The Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges', prepared by The World in 2050 Initiative and published by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater, she said, underscoring the importance of knowledge-brokering capacity at the local and national levels. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, underscoring the power of partnerships among all stakeholders. She also drew attention to a global funding initiative for science.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. As Commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she set regulations for drivers, as the number of vehicle operators, such as yellow cabs and Uber cars, dramatically increased over a short period of time. It was critical to gather data, such as trip details, including where a ride started and ended, and how much drivers earned. Without data and data analytics, policies are based on public testimonies and anecdotes. Local governments will not know how to regulate if they lack information, she asserted, stressing that data helps decision makers devise better polices for residents.</p><p>Ms. MURRAY stressed the importance of implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a central element for achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is essential to strengthen the science-policy interface, as science and technology can empower stakeholders. Science can help define disaster hazards, she said, underscoring the need for a multisectoral approach to disaster risk management and for data to be usable for all stakeholders.</p><p>Mr. CONTIUS commended the report for outlining ways to accelerate transformation, mitigate trade-offs and harness synergies. It offers a good basis for discussion at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit and can inform integrated policy for lagging areas. He expressed hope that the next report, due in 2023, will reveal far more progress than today.</p><p>In the ensuing dialogue, the representative of France called for building scientific capacity in Africa to better understand such regional challenges as inequality and the effects of climate change. Official development assistance (ODA) should prioritize capacity building for scientific research institutions in the region.</p><p>The representative of Norway said science is at the heart of transformation, commending the group of experts for presenting a bold report. Success hinges on effective follow-up.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said the report provides valuable evidence based insights. It is now up to policymakers to make difficult choices. Underscoring that scientists and policymakers must engage, he said the political declaration for September's Summit should explicitly refer to the Global Sustainable Development Report.</p><p>The representative of Jamaica said data collection remains a challenge for small island developing States. She welcomed the diversity of the expert panel, as the specific needs of these countries must be considered.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS welcomed comments from the floor, noting that the panel will seek to incorporate suggestions into the final report.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI described access to data and knowledge as 'hugely uneven', stressing the need to build knowledge platforms in developing countries through South-South and North-South cooperation. ODA can be used for that purpose.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN emphasized the need to link big data across all disciplines.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing examples, said data found that 96 per cent of taxi drivers made less than the minimum wage. Based on this finding, the local government set a new policy to support their business. Underscoring the need to secure data and protect privacy, she said data can improve the daily life in large cities.</p><p>The representative of the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities said that, as technologies address many barriers faced by this group, people with disabilities should be included in the development of technologies.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing an example, said that data had informed a policy devised in 2018 to enable people using wheelchairs to find a ride within 15 minutes.</p><p>The representative of the Dominican Republic pointed out that the science policy interface is not strong enough in some countries. Scientists need Government, and Government needs scientists.</p><p>The representative of the women's major group expressed concern about the public-private partnership model as corporate power has trampled human rights in Mongolia. The report also lacks gender and human rights perspectives.</p><p>The representative of the Republic of Korea said the report disproportionately focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainable development and expressed hope that the concluding chapter will be more evidence based. To strengthen the science policy interface, more scientists must be included in the preparation of United Nations reports. At the country level, the scientific community can be involved in monitoring and reviewing processes, such as that for the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014 2024.</p><p>The representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Agency uses nuclear science and technology to advance sustainable development, including in the areas of agriculture, water, health and energy.</p><p>The representative of Ghana said his country has incorporated science, technology and innovation into its national development plan.</p><p>The representative of South Africa said his country has been addressing poverty and making the economy more competitive through science, technology and innovations, noting that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) listed South Africa among the world's innovation achievers in 2018.</p><p>The representative of the European Union welcomed the report, notably the knowledge-based transformation framework involving four levers and six entry points.</p><p>The representative of Sweden said his country supports research capacity in developing countries through restructured funding schemes and urged other Governments to do so.</p><p>The representative of Rwanda said innovation occurs in Africa, but is restricted by a lack of capacity, citing 'brain drain'. She asked panellists how science and research hubs can be created in developing countries.</p><p>The representative of the Bahamas said her country hosted a technology summit and revised immigration policy to attract science and technology professionals. Ongoing capacity building is critical.</p><p>The representative of Kenya said his country established a science, technology and innovation observatory.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI responded to the point about 'brain drain' by underscoring the difficulty of retaining talent in the public sector, as big tech companies offering higher salaries to attract job seekers. While at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she had sought to attract talent by offering them opportunities to work on big projects, travel and participate in training courses, as well as by appealing to their sense of public service.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI said the report is guided by the principle of 'leaving no one behind', including women and other marginalized groups. It focuses on three dimensions of sustainable development, he said, highlighting the critical relationship between people and nature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRNEW-AFRNEWS1107201900015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-V8X1-F00C-644K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4573\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Africa Newswire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Africa Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons and identifying both priorities and barriers.</p><p>Panellist Donovan Guttieres, representing the major group for children and youth, said that, while 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality to the Forum, good examples of participation are more often the exception than the rule. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he said the Forum must rethink the way it fosters participation.</p><p>Panellist Pooja Rangaprasad, Director at the Society for International Development, focused on global democratic governance. She wondered whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations, recommending that the Organization establish a mechanism for resolving crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development.</p><p>In the ensuing discussions, representatives of Government, major groups and stakeholders agreed that civil society needs a bigger say in the Forum, with a speaker from the women's major group stressing that discussions should take place at the national and regional levels \"because that is where the people are\". A speaker from the indigenous peoples' major group likewise appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass-roots consultations targeting those being left behind.</p><p>\"We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,\" said a representative of the major group for children and youth, who objected to civil society's tokenistic participation in the Forum. On that point, France's delegate said her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>Several speakers underscored the link between human rights and sustainable development, including the representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group, who suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that reflects the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights. Norway's delegate, expressing alarm at attacks on human rights and environmental rights defenders, said civil society must have space to hold Governments to account. \"It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved,\" she said.</p><p>Also today, the Forum held a thematic review on the interface between science and policy that featured a briefing by the independent group of scientists preparing the Global Sustainable Development Report for release at the September Summit.</p><p>Report Co-Chair Peter Messerli of the Center for Development and Environment at the University of Bern said the report will identify targets that are on track to be achieved and those that not, citing hunger, inequality, environment as areas in which results are going in the wrong direction. The report will also pinpoint trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed, he said.</p><p>Noting that science can identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, co-chair Endah Murniningtyas, Indonesia's former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, said the report will highlight the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Panellist Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer of the International Science Council, said scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, drawing attention to a global science funding initiative.</p><p>Panellist Meera Joshi, former head of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. Citing her experience overseeing yellow cabs and Uber cars, she stressed the importance for policies to be based on data, not anecdotes.</p><p>When the floor opened for discussion, France's representative stressed the need to build science capacity in Africa to better understand its challenges, including inequality and effects of climate change. Her counterpart from Jamaica noted, however, that collecting data is a challenge for small island developing States.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Forum meeting under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council on the theme \"Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality\" held a discussion on implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and between nations.</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will reconvene at noon on Friday, 12 July, to continue its work.</p><p>Thematic Discussion</p><p>The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development began the day with a thematic discussion titled \"Perspectives of society\", moderated by Katarina Popovic, Secretary-General, International Council for Adult Education and Representative, education and academia stakeholder group to the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group; and Paola Simonetti, Deputy Director, Economic and Social Policy Department, International Trade Union Confederation and Co-Chair of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders Steering Group. It featured presentations by Jose Viera, Chief Executive Officer, World Blind Union and Co-Lead, Major Groups Task Group on High-Level Political Forum Reform; Pooja Rangaprasad, Director, Policy and Advocacy, Financing for Development, Society for International Development and Civil Society Financing for Development Group; Warda Rina, Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development, and Co-Chair, Asia Pacific Regional Civil Society Organizations Engagement Mechanism; and Donovan Guttieres, major group for children and youth.</p><p>KIRA CHRISTIANNE DANGANAN AZUCENA (Philippines), Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council, said the session would highlight the essential role that major groups and other stakeholders play in implementing and monitoring the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It would also hear about progress and challenges that various groups face in implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Ms. SIMONETTI said that, as the first phase of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals concludes, it is time to determine how the review process can be carried forward. During this session, major groups and other stakeholders which have contributed to regional forums and national review mechanisms can report on their contributions, and discuss whether the Forum is faithfully carrying out its mandate.</p><p>Mr. VIERA, outlining a set of principles to make the review process more democratic and productive, proposed greater emphasis on the inclusion of all groups, especially those most marginalized. Reform of the Forum should be based on results-oriented actions, an analysis of shortcomings and a determination of the systemic factors that lead to them. Participants must be more dynamic and not just congratulate themselves on what has been achieved. More resources should be made available to civil society, especially at the national level, while in the Forum, there must be more room for civil society to contribute. To exclude these principles from the Forum's reform would be to miss out on the many opportunities offered by the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>A representative of the children and youth major group from the Philippines, underscoring the need to step up stakeholder engagement, said that, in her region, many non-governmental organizations feel they are not part of the 2030 Agenda process. Having contributed to national review processes, they want feedback from Governments. \"We need to know, in order to have a hand in what happens next,\" she said, calling for an end to the tokenistic participation of civil society.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Rwanda said women and girls \"in all their diversity\" must be at the heart of discussions. Noting that patriarchal systems limit choices, she called for greater investment in accessible, gender-responsive social services. For societies to be inclusive, and women and girls to be empowered, the broader system must be addressed, she added.</p><p>A representative of the indigenous people's major group said there is a huge gap in the participation and inclusion of indigenous peoples at the national level during preparations for voluntary national reviews. She appealed for an enabling environment where views can be expressed freely and without fear, alongside grass-roots consultations targeting those being left behind. Noting that 92 per cent of the targets underpinning the Goals are linked to legally binding human rights instruments, she said the human rights obligations of States must be integrated into voluntary national reviews.</p><p>A representative of the Asia-Pacific Regional Civil Society Organization Engagement Mechanism drew attention to the situation of migrant female workers and called for the establishment of just, equitable and sustainable economies.</p><p>The representative of the Philippines said his country takes pride in its consultative processes when it prepares its voluntary national reviews. Such reviews are an opportunity to connect with stakeholders from different sectors and regions. He added that his country's reports are posted online for public comment and recommendations.</p><p>The representative of France said the Forum's wealth is based on the unique place it gives to civil society and the major groups. She added that her delegation would yield its time to civil society whenever possible.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the bloc considers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to be a shared responsibility that depends on the participation of all stakeholders.</p><p>The representative of Belgium drew attention to the absence of youth voices from the global South. The Goals are a worldwide story in which everyone including young people must have a say. \"We may not have decades of working experience, but that may be our strength,\" she stated.</p><p>Ms. POPOVIC said the discussion would turn to ways of integrating cross-cutting topics and thematic processes, such as development financing, food security and science, technology and innovation.</p><p>Ms. RANGAPRASAD said the key question is raising global democratic governance. Much is heard about illicit financial flows as a challenge to be addressed, but it is often packaged as a \"technical definition\" issue when it is, in fact, a political question about whether the United Nations should have a mandate to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Reorienting the goals of a global tax system one designed by developed countries, but not working for developing States is not a purely national exercise. She proposed a United Nations \"debt workout\" mechanism that would make it possible to resolve debt crises without undermining human rights and sustainable development. She also discussed the need for a global mechanism that can address the transboundary impact of emerging technologies.</p><p>Ms. RINA said the patriarchal and militarized model of development is clearly not working. It must be replaced with people-centred development that addresses inequalities. Civil society is paving the way, driving regional engagement mechanisms with structures that ensure that grass-roots voices are heard. Emphasizing that the text of the 2030 Agenda includes the term \"regional\" more than 30 times, she said regional processes have much to offer in terms of strengthening accountability, sharing lessons learned and identifying priorities and barriers. Citing examples in Latin America, she added that regional processes have great potential for charting ways to implement the Goals.</p><p>The representative of the LGBTI stakeholder group stated that more than 90 per cent of the Goals are linked to specific articles in international human rights instruments. Emphasizing the crucial role that national human rights institutions can play, she suggested that the Forum produce an outcome document that addresses the complementary relationship between the Goals and human rights.</p><p>The representative of the food and agriculture cluster of the non-governmental organization major group said that, with global food insecurity on the rise, the world is far from achieving Goal 2 (zero hunger). Urging leaders to demonstrate political will, she said the right to food alone is not the solution to global hunger.</p><p>A representative of the women's major group from Latin America and the Caribbean said fundamental discussions on implementing the 2030 Agenda should take place at the national and regional levels \"because that is where the people are\". She also noted the difficulty that Forum participants can face in obtaining visas and paying for airfare to attend its annual sessions. Another representative of the same major group, from Women Engage for a Common Future, said there is not enough critical analysis of human rights violations, especially violence against women. Voluntary national reviews should be discussed at regional forums with civil society providing alternative reports.</p><p>A representative of the African Regional Society stakeholder group said the integration of regional processes into the Forum's work must be strengthened, with more space allowed for regional voices.</p><p>Mr. GUTTIERES said 142 countries have presented voluntary national reviews of increasing quality, but as the Forum heard today, there are still challenges to meaningful participation. Good examples are often exceptions, not the rule, he said. Looking ahead to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September, he cautioned against becoming locked into a framework of passive dialogue. The Forum should rethink the way participation is carried out and address the factors that place the 2030 Agenda in jeopardy. Reaffirming commitments is not enough, he said, calling for redoubled efforts.</p><p>The representative of Norway said Governments bear the primary responsibility for delivering on the 2030 Agenda, but success depends on partnership with all stakeholders at all levels. Emphasizing that freedom of expression is an urgent priority for Norway, she expressed alarm at attacks on civil society, human rights and environmental rights defenders in many parts of the world. Civil society must have space to hold Governments to account, she said, adding: \"It's not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do if the Goals are to be achieved.\"</p><p>The representative of the workers and trade unions major group said voluntary national reviews often merely report progress on individual Goals without considering the linkages among them. Calling for dialogue, she warned that consultation and engagement are not synonyms, and that engagement cannot be a \"check-the-box exercise\". The role of the private sector should not outweigh that of civil society, she said, and shadow reports from civil society groups should be published by Governments and the United Nations.</p><p>A representative of the major group for children and youth from Canada said she no longer wants to be part of the voluntary national review process. \"You are leaving people behind [...] because of your inaction,\" she said. Young people have potential and if Forum participants want to be included in their development efforts, they are welcome to join.</p><p>Also participating in the discussion were representatives of Azerbaijan, Kenya, Morocco, Mexico, Sweden, Guatemala and the Czech Republic.</p><p>Thematic Review II</p><p>The Forum then held a thematic review on the science-policy interface and heard a briefing from the independent group of scientists on the Global Sustainable Development Report. Moderated by Romain Murenzi, Executive Director, World Academy of Sciences, it featured presentations by Endah Murniningtyas, former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia, and Co-chair of the Global Sustainable Development Report; Peter Messerli, Director, Center for Development and Environment, University of Bern, Switzerland, and Co-chair of Global Sustainable Development Report; Heide Hackmann, Chief Executive Officer, International Science Council; and Meera Joshi, former Commissioner, New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p><p>Stephan Contius, Commissioner, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany; and Virginia Murray, Head of Global Disaster Risk Reduction, Public Health England and member of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk scientific committee, served as lead discussants.</p><p>Mr. MURENZI said science, technology and innovations are essential to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Noting that the panel will examine ways for policymakers to open and amplify communication with the science community, as well as ways to ensure that messages received from the social and natural sciences are fully integrated into policies, he said it will also explore how the science community can become a more effective partner in carrying out the 2030 Agenda specifically in terms of institutional structures, approaches and communication. It will also examine how the United Nations can increase engagement from science communities, funders, academia and the private sector.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI, noting that the independent group of scientists was mandated to produce the Global Sustainable Development Report, said the team worked on it over the past two and half years. After assessing and integrating feedback from Member States and other stakeholders, the report will be launched at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit in September. The report identifies targets that are on track to be achieved, as well as those that are off track. In some areas, results are going in the wrong direction, notably the areas of hunger, inequality and environment. The report also identifies trade-offs among the Goals that must be addressed and mutual benefits to be harnessed. It also provides a knowledge-based transformation framework consisting of four levers governance; economy and finance; individual and collective action; and science and technology as well as six entry points of transformation, namely: human well-being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; energy decarbonization and access; food systems and nutrition patterns; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. He explained how this framework works in Nigeria around solar technology, addressing trade-offs and harnessing synergies among the Goals.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS stressed the importance of national context, as one country's situation is different from another's. The report identifies the role of science in informing policymaking, tracking progress and identifying countries and regions that need help. Noting that science can also identify emerging issues beyond the implementation of the Goals, she said the report also highlights the importance of partnerships in enhancing science capacity in developing countries.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN highlighted achievements of the scientific community, including a report titled, \"The Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges\", prepared by The World in 2050 Initiative and published by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Scientific contributions to sustainable development could be far greater, she said, underscoring the importance of knowledge-brokering capacity at the local and national levels. The United Nations can reinforce the critical role of science through more effective coordination, she said, underscoring the power of partnerships among all stakeholders. She also drew attention to a global funding initiative for science.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI stressed the importance of data and data analytics to local governments. As Commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she set regulations for drivers, as the number of vehicle operators, such as yellow cabs and Uber cars, dramatically increased over a short period of time. It was critical to gather data, such as trip details, including where a ride started and ended, and how much drivers earned. Without data and data analytics, policies are based on public testimonies and anecdotes. Local governments will not know how to regulate if they lack information, she asserted, stressing that data helps decision makers devise better polices for residents.</p><p>Ms. MURRAY stressed the importance of implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a central element for achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is essential to strengthen the science-policy interface, as science and technology can empower stakeholders. Science can help define disaster hazards, she said, underscoring the need for a multisectoral approach to disaster risk management and for data to be usable for all stakeholders.</p><p>Mr. CONTIUS commended the report for outlining ways to accelerate transformation, mitigate trade-offs and harness synergies. It offers a good basis for discussion at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit and can inform integrated policy for lagging areas. He expressed hope that the next report, due in 2023, will reveal far more progress than today.</p><p>In the ensuing dialogue, the representative of France called for building scientific capacity in Africa to better understand such regional challenges as inequality and the effects of climate change. Official development assistance (ODA) should prioritize capacity-building for scientific research institutions in the region.</p><p>The representative of Norway said science is at the heart of transformation, commending the group of experts for presenting a bold report. Success hinges on effective follow-up.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said the report provides valuable evidence-based insights. It is now up to policymakers to make difficult choices. Underscoring that scientists and policymakers must engage, he said the political declaration for September's Summit should explicitly refer to the Global Sustainable Development Report.</p><p>The representative of Jamaica said data collection remains a challenge for small island developing States. She welcomed the diversity of the expert panel, as the specific needs of these countries must be considered.</p><p>Ms. MURNININGTYAS welcomed comments from the floor, noting that the panel will seek to incorporate suggestions into the final report.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI described access to data and knowledge as \"hugely uneven\", stressing the need to build knowledge platforms in developing countries through South-South and North-South cooperation. ODA can be used for that purpose.</p><p>Ms. HACKMANN emphasized the need to link big data across all disciplines.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing examples, said data found that 96 per cent of taxi drivers made less than the minimum wage. Based on this finding, the local government set a new policy to support their business. Underscoring the need to secure data and protect privacy, she said data can improve the daily life in large cities.</p><p>The representative of the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities said that, as technologies address many barriers faced by this group, people with disabilities should be included in the development of technologies.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI, citing an example, said that data had informed a policy devised in 2018 to enable people using wheelchairs to find a ride within 15 minutes.</p><p>The representative of the Dominican Republic pointed out that the science-policy interface is not strong enough in some countries. Scientists need Government, and Government needs scientists.</p><p>The representative of the women's major group expressed concern about the public-private partnership model as corporate power has trampled human rights in Mongolia. The report also lacks gender and human rights perspectives.</p><p>The representative of the Republic of Korea said the report disproportionately focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainable development and expressed hope that the concluding chapter will be more evidence-based. To strengthen the science-policy interface, more scientists must be included in the preparation of United Nations reports. At the country level, the scientific community can be involved in monitoring and reviewing processes, such as that for the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024.</p><p>The representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Agency uses nuclear science and technology to advance sustainable development, including in the areas of agriculture, water, health and energy.</p><p>The representative of Ghana said his country has incorporated science, technology and innovation into its national development plan.</p><p>The representative of South Africa said his country has been addressing poverty and making the economy more competitive through science, technology and innovations, noting that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) listed South Africa among the world's innovation achievers in 2018.</p><p>The representative of the European Union welcomed the report, notably the knowledge-based transformation framework involving four levers and six entry points.</p><p>The representative of Sweden said his country supports research capacity in developing countries through restructured funding schemes and urged other Governments to do so.</p><p>The representative of Rwanda said innovation occurs in Africa, but is restricted by a lack of capacity, citing \"brain drain\". She asked panellists how science and research hubs can be created in developing countries.</p><p>The representative of the Bahamas said her country hosted a technology summit and revised immigration policy to attract science and technology professionals. Ongoing capacity-building is critical.</p><p>The representative of Kenya said his country established a science, technology and innovation observatory.</p><p>Ms. JOSHI responded to the point about \"brain drain\" by underscoring the difficulty of retaining talent in the public sector, as big tech companies offering higher salaries to attract job seekers. While at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, she had sought to attract talent by offering them opportunities to work on big projects, travel and participate in training courses, as well as by appealing to their sense of public service.</p><p>Mr. MESSERLI said the report is guided by the principle of \"leaving no one behind\", including women and other marginalized groups. It focuses on three dimensions of sustainable development, he said, highlighting the critical relationship between people and nature.</p><p>Environmental issues and sustainable development</p><p>For information media.

Not a day, not a night. And we want to hear from you about tonight's show. Tweet me, @IngrahamAngle. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team takes things from here. Ms. Shannon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm going to tweet that you had a great show, how about that? Right after I finished this show. Thanks, Laura.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM: All right. Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Here's what we have coming up tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM (voice-over): Chief national correspondent, Ed Henry and chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge track the latest developments after the president refers to Special Counsel Robert Mueller by name for the first time and calls his collusion probe a witch-hunt. Republican Study Committee chairman, Mark Walker dives into the debate over the deep state following some stunning new poll numbers.</p><p>And we'll investigate the Facebook data controversy as a campaign official drops a bombshell. Facebook, she says helps former President Obama's election bid.</p><p>And the president's Twitter tirade against the special counsel caught the eye of the Dilbert creator, Scott Adams. He's got a message for folks claiming the president abusing his power. He joins us, live.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>The president and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, one GOP lawmaker says there is zero chance the president fires Mueller. He joins us live in just a minute. While others like Senator Orrin Hatch, for example, say, they don't support special protection for the special counsel but Hatch add this, firing Mueller would be the stupidest thing the president could ever do.</p><p>Team coverage tonight with chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge with new details about the firing of the number two man at the FBI, Andrew McCabe. Ellison Barber, tracking GOP lawmakers' threats to go after the FBI as they accuse the agency of refusing to turn over documents related to the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>We begin with chief national correspondent, Ed Henry on an aggressive new addition to the president's legal team. Good evening, Ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Breaking tonight, I've spoken to people close to the president who are worried that while the obstruction of justice phase with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe might have been petering out, now this more aggressive approach with Mueller by the president and his legal team could spark a whole new round of combat that actually reignites the investigation. One week after the president tweeted he was happy with his legal team, he has now hired the tough attorney, Joseph DiGenova, someone with a scurvy reputation in part because he served as an independent counsel probing whether or not that George H.W. Bush White House broke any laws when officials got caught searching then candidate, Bill Clinton's passport files. DiGenova won praise for looking at the facts and declaring while the dirt digging by the Bush aide was sloppy, it was not illegal and not worth the time that expense of such a big investigation. DiGenova now joins an outside team of lawyers, including Jay Sekulow and John Dowd that has been under the microscope. Dowd left even some republicans like Trey Gowdy scratching their heads when he said this weekend that the Friday night ouster of former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe for leaking and lying, shows the probe of the president is illegitimate and should end.</p><p>While DiGenova back in January told our own Tucker Carlson, McCabe and FBI officials like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were part of a plot working to get Hillary Clinton off the hook and then framing the president when he beat Clinton. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: So just that Mueller should shut down and that all he is looking at is collusion, if you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: make no mistake about it, a group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.</p><p>HENRY: While Democrats continue to try to fan the flames and claim the president will fire Mueller, a White House lawyer denied that, though the president did mention Mueller for the first time in a tweet over the weekend declaring, \"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big crooked Hillary supporters and zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added, does anyone think this is fair? And yet there is no collusion.\"</p><p>We're also learning McCabe kept notes on his meetings with the president that are now in the hands of Mueller. Those are not clear if there's anything damaging there. McCabe's attorney, meanwhile, Michael Bromwich tweeted, \"We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting, and false tweet by the president. The whole truth will come out in due course. But the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the process that led to Mr. McCabe's termination and has rendered it illegitimate.\"</p><p>But that claim that the process is corrupted could actually backfired to McCabe. Making it more likely the justice department says, a second special counsel is needed. So an actual outsider can probe abuses at the FBI and justice department which exactly what the president has wanted for a long time. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: We are standing by. All right. Ed Henry, thank you very much.</p><p>James Comey, Andre McCabe, and a half dozen more officials from the FBI have left their jobs. Amid intense scrutiny over actions they took allegedly aimed directly at the Trump administration.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge is here with that story and a word also that McCabe took notes during his meetings with the president and has turned them over to the special counsel. Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, tonight's special counsel Robert Mueller already has memos from fired FBI director, James Comey and now he's fired deputy Andrew McCabe as the political fallout grows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE (voice-over): A source close to the fired FBI deputy director confirms he documented conversations with President Trump where he often raised McCabe's wife and her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia senate race. She received more than $600,000 from Democrats including then governor, Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally.</p><p>The FBI said the campaign contributions were not a conflict because it was before McCabe took the helm of the Clinton e-mail case. But critics say the contributions showed bad judgment. And McCabe's termination for cause undercut his credibility.</p><p>REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK: I don't think it's any big deal. I'm sure that President Trump never said anything to Andrew McCabe that was illegal or implied any type of illegality. So keep all the memos you want and turn them over.</p><p>HERRIDGE: President Trump who praised McCabe's firing as a great day for the FBI, emphasized that he spent very little time with the FBI's former number two, insinuating McCabe drafted the memos to help his own agenda periods. One senior Republican call for public hearings to show whether McCabe's termination was suspect coming two days before his government pension kicked in.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: When it comes to this issue, we need as much transparency as possible. You make sure it wasn't politically motivated.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Fox News has learned the FBI branch that investigates misconduct allegations began looking at McCabe as early as last summer. The grounds for termination go beyond immediate leaks. The inspector general concluded McCabe lacked candor on multiple occasions. FBI veterans who want the inspector general to make the evidence public, as soon as possible, say bureau rules online are strict.</p><p>RONALD HOSKO, FORM FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Lack of candor potentially gets you fired. That expectation applies to the brand-new FBI agent and it should apply to the deputy director.</p><p>HERRIDGE: A senior House Democrat indicated McCabe's firing may be justified. But he remains concerned about a broader pattern. A half-dozen of Director Comey's closest associates, including former general counsel James Baker, chief of staff, James Rybicki, senior agent Peter Strzok, lawyer Lisa Page, media chief, Mike Horton (ph), have been retired, been fired, reassigned or demoted.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Is it because they corroborate James Comey? That's a question we also have to answer.</p><p>HERRIDGE: In this statement, McCabe said Director Comey knew about his conduct with the media, which observers said appears to conflict with the former director's testimony days before he got fired.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R), IOWA: Have you ever authorize someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: No.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: The inspector general's report could come at any time, but in recent weeks, two sources tell Fox new leads were pursued and new interviews conducted. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Catherine Herridge with the latest. Thank you very much.</p><p>Well, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee is threatening to subpoena the Department of Justice for documents on the Clinton e-mail probe. That's right. Comes in the wake of the firing of Andrew McCabe and what some are calling plots among the highest levels to protect Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Ellison Barber is here live tracking the very latest. Hello, Ellison.</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon. The decision to fire McCabe allegedly came because of things discovered during an investigation by the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz. Horowitz and his team are looking into a few different allegations in regards to the FBI and DOJ's actions before the 2016 election. Largely in regards to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. The report, of course, is not public yet and according to the chairman of the house judiciary committee, it's taking too long.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Are you going to subpoena these documents?</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA: Well, the answer is yes, and as I say, the whole matter is coming to a head. We've had communications with the Department of Justice about this.</p><p>BARBER: Chairman Bob Goodlatte says congress has only seen a small percentage of the documents collected. The ones they've seen include text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page to some what they have already proves nefarious action.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: The FBI's in cover-up mode. The justice department is helping them along.</p><p>JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: High-ranking people throughout the government, not just the FBI, high-ranking people had a plot to not have Hillary Clinton, you know, indicted.</p><p>BARBER: To others, the documents the IG investigation have become part of an out-of-control conspiracy.</p><p>PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER ADVISER TO HILLARY CLINTON: The origin of the inspector general at the Department of Justice launching this investigation was to look at the totality of 2016 and actually as far back as 2015 to look at the behavior of Director Comey and the FBI in terms of how it handled Secretary Clinton's e-mail. At some point last fall, it became more about the text messages that were discovered between various FBI agents who were involved in that investigation. If there was a deep state that was in favor of Hillary Clinton, she'd be president right now. If there was a deep state that controlled the FBI that wanted to go easy on Hillary Clinton, they never would've started an investigation of her.</p><p>BARBER: In a new poll from Monmouth University, 74 percent of Americans said the deep state probably or definitely exists within the federal government. Monmouth defined deep state as the possible existence of a group of unelected government and military officials who secretly manipulate or directs national policy. It look at privacy concerns as well and the director of Monmouth's Polling Institute's head across the across- the-board, the findings were worrisome because in his words the strength of our government relies on public safety and protecting our freedoms. And that isn't particularly robust right now. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Ellison. Thank you, very much.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about the so-called deep state, the McCabe firing, another potential government shutdown and much more, Republican Study committee chairman, Congressman Mark Walker. Who alas sits on the House oversight and government reform committee?. Great to have you with us tonight.</p><p>REP. MARK WALKER (R), NORTH CAROLINA: Always a privilege, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So let's start with the deep state. Do those numbers surprise you at all that Ellison was reporting there? Seventy-four percent of Americans poll think it's actually a thing and it's manipulating potentially government action.</p><p>WALKER: I would agree. In fact, those numbers across congress, 74 percent of our congress members would probably agree the deep state exist because we see it on the daily basis.</p><p>BREAM: All right. So with that in mind, I thought it was interesting as well in those numbers that it cross party lines. It was Republicans, independents, and Democrats all in the 70s who believe that that is going on. As now the house looks at possibly subpoena in the FBI, because you're not getting cooperation there.</p><p>WALKER: Exactly. There's no question for the deep state people here in this culture, it's not about passion or policy. It's about retaining power. Far beyond Democrats and Republicans. It's about keeping that power and doing whatever they need to do to keep and retain that power.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So let's talk about somebody who's not in power anymore, and that's Andrew McCabe. He's gone. He was going to officially retire. The attorney general stepped in and said, no, I'm going to terminate him instead. He was acting, he said, on the recommendations of the IG and then his investigation was forwarded to the Office of Professional Responsibility within the DOJ.</p><p>Now, Robin Ashton, at least online, is the one who is still heading up that agency. That portion of the agency. Here's what then attorney general, Eric Holder had to say about her when he appointed her back in 2010. He said, \"As a veteran career prosecutor, Robin, is uniquely qualified to serve as counsel for professional responsibility and I am confident she will lead the office with the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and dedication.\"</p><p>To my understanding, that's the person who ultimately told the attorney general that McCabe should be fired.</p><p>WALKER: Absolutely. And then seven years of service, her integrity, Robin Ashton's integrity has never been in question. So you look at this of when the investigation actually started before President Trump was even inaugurated. If you look at the who, you have two Democratic nominated and appointed people. You have the Inspector General Horowitz, 2011 and Ms. Robin Ashton, 2010 by Eric Holder. Nobody has ever question their integrity. So now you reach the place of what were the charges? There was leaking and also lacking of candor. If you look at lacking of candor and look at the antonyms of candor, it's dishonesty, it's deceit, it's lying. So the DOJ, Attorney General Sessions made the right decision in releasing McCabe. There's much more to this and I believe we're just starting at the beginning of it.</p><p>BREAM: Do you have any idea or any sense better than we do about when that IG report will come out so that everybody can see it? My understanding is that McCabe's team said they did have a chance to see it and they said up until a couple days before inspiring, they were still getting exculpatory evidence that would have benefited him.</p><p>WALKER: We wanted to make sure this IG inspector's report comes out for the American people to be able to see. Do we have a specific date? We have not been given to it, but I'm advocating along with many others that the American public can see this firsthand because I believe this is the scratch of services or peeling back the layers on the deep state here in Washington D.C.</p><p>BREAM: Now, we are looking at yet another potential government shutdown, if you guys don't get a funding deal done. By Friday night midnight. We'll be here, in case you want to join us. Hopefully you'll have a deal by then. But you if you don't.</p><p>I wanted to read something that I saw you quoted in the Hill that you're worried because Republican leaders who say will attach anything that leans to the left because at this point, I believe they're going to count on more Democrat votes than Republicans. And the piece goes on to talk a number of things that the left would love to see. And they may get tacked onto this. Would you vote for it?</p><p>WALKER: No, these Democratic, left-leaning writers get attached to this omnibus, there's no way that I can support it. I think 80 Republicans voted against it the last time or something, some version of this. It would be very troubling for many of us who have promised the people that we represent that we would not support ideas such as the legalization or the stabilization of Obamacare, things of those natures, making sure that pro- life writers are certainly strong. It is trending the right direction from our conference meeting we have this tonight. But we're going to make sure specifically this is about spending. If you look at the last three years of the Obama administration, deficits ran 15 percent, 12 percent, and 13 percent. Right now, we're heading in a 21 percent deficit. So for Republicans who have been jumping up and down talking about fiscal responsibility, it would be hypocritical as not to do the same at this point.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, odds of a shutdown on Friday night?</p><p>WALKER: I will say 10 percent. How about that?</p><p>BREAM: OK. All right. We will see if your prediction comes true. Congressman, great to have you with us.</p><p>WALKER: Thank you, Shannon. And congratulations on the great February. Best month ever I hear.</p><p>BREAM: Thank you very much. We're, you know, working hard every night and thanks to you and other great guests who joined us. Thank you. All right. We'll have highlights from President Trump's trip to New Hampshire featuring everyday Americans with powerful stories to tell. The President also provoking outrage from some locals incensed over his comments on sanctuary cities. Stick around for a live report on that. And also, attack-dog, Attorney Joe diGenova joining the Trump legal team. Does it signal a new, even more aggressive approach to Special Counsel Robert Mueller? Our panel will debate.</p><p>BREAM: The President traveling to ground zero in the opioid epidemic. New Hampshire. Focusing on both on the gut-wrenching damage caused by the public health emergency and the administration's new efforts to combat it. Rick Leventhal joins us live from Manchester with more. Good evening, Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. The death rate from drug overdoses in New Hampshire is doubled, the national average. In fact 70 percent of the calls that firefighters answer are not for smoking claims but for medical issues, primarily drug overdoses. And that's one reason why the President made the Manchester Fire Department his first stop this afternoon to get a first-hand look at their safe station program where addicts are invited to come here before they O.D. and get fast-track into a drug treatment program. In his remarks this afternoon at Manchester College, the President talked about expanding treatment but focus on getting tougher on drug dealers, suggesting major traffickers should face the death penalty for potentially destroying thousands of lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And of all the Blue Ribbon Committee's we want but if we don't get tough on the drug dealers, we're wasting our time. Just remember that. We're wasting our time. And that toughness includes the death penalty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Focus on preventing Americans from becoming addicted in the first place by finding non-addictive pain medications. And also punish drug companies and doctors for overprescribing opioids, cutting perceptions by a third over the next three years. The President also introduced some parents who lost a child and also introduced some of the agents fighting the criminals on the front lines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN MOSER, SON DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSE: He got hooked on it and had to go the street eventually and he found fentanyl. And he's been gone for 2-1/2 years and we miss him every day.</p><p>DERRICK DUNN, ICE AGENT: It's been an absolute battle. We all worked together and we're going to get this solved.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: The President also stressed the importance of building the border wall to stop the flow of illegal drugs from Mexico and talked about the critical nature of getting rid of sanctuary cities because he says they are protecting major traffickers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: According to a recent Dartmouth study, the sanctuary city of Lawrence, Massachusetts, is one of the primary sources of fentanyl in six New Hampshire counties. ICE recently arrested 15 M.S.-13 gang members. These are not good people, folks, OK? These are bad, bad people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Moving forward in the weeks ahead, the President says he will cut drug prices for millions of Americans but the focus today, Shannon was on those lives lost. 116 Americans dying everything single day from drug overdoses. And the President says if we don't get tough, those numbers won't get any lower. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Rick, thank you very much. Well, a brand new edition to the President's legal team, Attorney Joe diGenova. He has argued actors within the Justice Department are trying to take down the President of the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE DIGENOVA, D.C. LAWYER: This is the single most important scandal of the last 50 years because senior DOJ and FBI officials engaged in conduct that was designed to corrupt an American presidential election. It wasn't the Russians who corrupted the presidential election. It was the American officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Let's talk about it with tonight's panel. Adrienne Elrod, former director of strategic communications for Hillary Clinton, Charlie hurt, the opinion editor for The Washington Times and a Fox News Contributor, and Katie Pavlich, Fox News Contributor and townhall.com editor. Great to see all of you tonight.</p><p>CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening.</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, FORMER DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So talking about this edition now of Joe diGenova, the Hill today says that adding diGenova suggest Trump wants to go more on the offensive given diGenova's past statements arguing that investigation of Trump are meritless. The New York Times said he pursues or he represents an aggressive president on the team. What do you think, Katie?</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes. I think that he certainly has a record in Washington, D.C. of being somewhat of a bulldog and as the Mueller investigation gets closer to the White House, not in the sense of any wrongdoing but just in the sense of wrapping up the investigation, the President wants everyone on his team who can defend him against any kind of allegation that the Mueller pro brings. And looking at the fact that we are now a year plus into this and with all of the indictments that have come down are unrelated to Russian collusion or the presidential election of 2016. I think the President is doing what he thinks is best in terms of defending himself and making sure he's covered on all bases. And bringing him in as the Washington, D.C. veteran and getting him a dirt, knowing how politics works in that town is probably not a bad idea.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And Adrienne, clearly the President is going on the offensive. I mean, the tweets this weekend, not restrained.</p><p>ELROD: Yes. Not restrained in the least. That's exactly right, Shannon. Look, I think it's clear that President Trump is staffing up. This investigation continues to ramp up by the day, he's obviously adding more to his legal team. He's adding somebody who agrees more ideologically in his view that there is a deep state as it exists within government. So, it's no surprise that he's adding attorneys. It also may -- this also may have to do with the fact that John Dowd made some controversial comments this past weekend about hoping that Rosenstein will end the Mueller investigation. Now that McCabe is gone. So, you know, there's no telling exactly why he's doing this really but it does seem that a lot of it has to do with the fact of the investigation is ramping up.</p><p>BREAM: Well -- and Charlie, someone argued that they think the investigation is winding down. We don't know because we're all in the dark kind of waiting for this thing but you had a piece out yesterday where you talk about the fact that you think that this Mueller investigation, the questioning of Trump's legitimacy, whether he colluded with Russia, all of this. You think -- you called it a trap that was set before he was even elected.</p><p>HURT: Well, certainly at the very least it's a new standard for a president. You know, it's used to be or we've -- for a long time all agreed upon the way that we elect a president. And now we have a new standard for this president and that is after he gets elected, after he wins the electoral college, after he was the primary, after he wins 60, you know, 60 million plus voters -- votes, we're going to now launch a bogus investigation into everything under the sun that has no limits. And we're going to let the FBI, we're going to let these career investigators, you know, and I'm not criticizing the FBI in general. But we're going to let these people conduct sort of a background check to tell us whether or not this can be our president. It's patently absurd and no way to, you know, to run, you know, run elections.</p><p>BREAM: All right. I want to get all of you to respond to these job offers that were floated by Democratic lawmakers for Andrew McCabe because, you know, as a result of him being fired, potentially he's going to lose a big chunk of his pension if not all of it unless he obtains other Federal employment. I don't know the details but, you know, there is some speculation that these job offers might be a way to solve that problem from him. One of them came from Congressman Gutierrez tweeting this. To Andrew McCabe: If you need a Federal job, call me on Monday. I am serious. We have to stand up to bullies like @realDonaldTrump &amp; @jeffsessions #Resist #twill #AndrewMcCabeFired #standuptobullies, you know, it goes on and on. So, Charlie, I'll start with you. What do you make of it?</p><p>HURT: Well, just -- if you ask me if it a goes to show just how politicized this -- the whole thing has been from the very beginning. It has nothing to do with justice, it has nothing to do with finding out about Russia's involvement in the election, has nothing to do with any of that. We could've done all that in a very nonpartisan way. What it really has to do with is people want to go after Donald Trump, and it's this -- truly a weaponization of the FBI and of course they were all -- far too many people in the FBI were far too willing to go along with that weaponization and so we want wind up with this where you have a guy tossed out for apparently lying to FBI officials and then lying to Congress about it. And then -- and then people in Congress are scrambling to give him a job. It's absolute -- it's insane.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I need to get quick reaction from Katie and Adrienne on that issue of these job offers. Adrienne, first to you.</p><p>ELROD: Yes. Look, I mean, you know, I think that this is obviously a way for, you know, Seth Moulton, some of these guys to get a little bit of press. I don't know if they're necessarily saying that this is in jest or if they're truly meaning it. But, you know, the real issue here is first of all, we don't know why exactly McCabe was fired. I mean, we know that Jeff Sessions fired him. We have didn't seem the I.G. report that came out because it hasn't come out yet. But this was recommended, his firing was recommended by the Office of Professional Conduct which is an independent agency within the -- within the Department of Justice. So, you know, we've got to see what happens and see what happens when this comes out. But I do think some of these guys, Seth Moulton, some of these Democrats have said to think perhaps it's a cheap shot that Andrew McCabe was fired 36 hours before he would have received his full pension.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Well -- OK. Katie, quickly to you.</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes. I just think that's it's a disservice to the country for Democrats to be coming out on the side of corrupt government officials. Andrew McCabe is being treated just like other FBI agents inside the agency who have been referred by the inspector general, by the Office of Professional Responsibility to lose his job for breaking the rules and potentially breaking the law. And for them to come out in his defense when it's a matter of accountability for a government official really is telling about which side of the set they're on.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Panel, stick around. We love to have you come back to talk about some other topics but that's it for now. In the meantime, a city in fear, another bombing in Austin and this one is more sophisticated. What will it take to crack the case. We got a live report from Texas. And a self-driving override turns deadly. What's next for the controversial technology?</p><p>BREAM: Police in Austin, Texas, are trying to determine whether there is solid evidence connecting another package bombing to three previously explosions in that city. Two people are dead, other's critically injured. Correspondent Casey Stegall, joins us live from the Texas, Capitol, with more tonight. Good evening, Casey.</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. And this is our first look, by the way, at the scene since the incident happened last night. It was closed all day long, the residents here were told to shelter in place. But since then, the roads have reopened and police have allowed people to come back in. The explosion itself happening literally just right back in that yard behind me.</p><p>More than 500 federal agents, boots on the ground, are working this case in Texas. And that is only at the federal level, we're not even talking about all of the State and local law enforcement resources being diverted to Austin. It gives you a sense of how urgent this is. Especially, when you have the city's police chief come out and say the words \"serial bomber\".</p><p>There was a visible concern on Chief Brian Manley's face when he informed the press at a news conference today that last night's bomb was more advanced than the previous three. Complete with a trip wire and hidden along a fence in this normally quiet neighborhood. Meaning, it was put there randomly, police say, to detonate on whoever reached it first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, CHIEF, AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT: I will reach out to the suspect, to suspects and ask that you contact us, ask that you reach out to us, communicate with us so that we can put this to an end. There are innocent people getting hurt in this community and it needs to come to a stop. The last thing we want to have is another injury or another death in our community.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEGALL: So, to refresh your memory on the timeline here, March 2nd, is when this all began in Austin. That's when the first explosion happened, it killed a man when he opened an unidentified package that contained a bomb and have been left on his front doorstep.</p><p>Ten days later, across town similar parcels showed up at two homes and exploded. A second victim died in one of those blasts and two others were critically hurt. Last week, there was some talk that there is a potential hate crime going on here or that minorities were targeted because the victims were African-American or Hispanic.</p><p>However, police now say, with what happened here last night that is out the window because this was, again, they believe put here randomly and not intended to target anyone specifically, just to do maximum damage. The two people injured here, Shannon, still in the hospital recovering tonight. Back to you.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Casey. Thank you very much, they are live on the scene for the update.</p><p>STEGALL: Sure.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Uber has been (INAUDIBLE) developing self-driving technologies, but the company's recent road test of driverless cars have come to a screeching halt because of a fatal collision in Arizona. Trace Gallagher, has more of the story, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, when it comes to autonomous cars, Arizona has been very accommodating and that's why the driverless car industry has flocked there to test their vehicles. And while Arizona does allow self-driving cars to operate without a human in the driver's seat, in this case, there was somebody behind the wheel in case something went wrong.</p><p>The woman who was hit and killed by the Volvo was near a movie theater and was walking her bicycle across a busy intersection outside at the crosswalk. It happened about 10:00 last night, and police say almost as soon as the woman stepped into the street, she was hit. The Uber car was traveling about 40 miles per hour and police say there were very few indications the car tried to slow down. As for the human in the driver seat, authorities will only say that he was not impaired, but they are not releasing his version of events. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dou you go about this just as if someone was actually driving the vehicle? Is the investigation, the same?</p><p>RONALD ELCOCK, SERGEANT, TEMPE POLICE DEPARTMENT, ARIZONA: It's going to be similar into the fact that they are going to attempt to try to find -- you know, what -- who was possibly at fault and how we can better be safe. Whether it's pedestrians or whether its the vehicle itself. But there -- that is going to be a part of the investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: The victim has been identified as 49 year old Elaine Herzberg. For now, Uber has suspended its self-driving programs in Phoenix, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Toronto. An Uber self-driving car was also involved in another crash a year ago in Tempe. In that collision, a Volvo sport utility was hit when the driver of another car fail to yield. The Uber vehicle was not at fault. In fact, the self-driving car has never been at fault in an accident. And this case is still being investigated.</p><p>The auto and technology industries have always warned that there could be accidents and deaths involving self-driving cars but they could eventually also save thousands of lives a year because they don't get distracted and always obey traffic laws. What they're not great at is unpredictable human driving or behavior. A proposal in the Senate would allow automakers within three years to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles if they can demonstrate they're as safe as current vehicles. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Trace Gallagher, in L.A., thank you. Well, the bombshell revelation amid outrage over Trump campaign consultants mining for Facebook data. A campaign aide to former President Obama, says they mine data from Facebook and the social media web site was supportive. We're going to walk you through the facts.</p><p>And presidential tweets analyzed by the cartoonist behind the popular Dilbert Comic. Scott Adams' unique take when we return.</p><p>BREAM: Facebook is taking considerable fire over reports that company led a data mining from affiliated with the Trump campaign have access to information about tens of millions of users.</p><p>Now, Facebook has blocked the groups involved and has launched an investigation. But tonight, a former campaign official for President Obama's 2012 runs says, they got a much different reaction when they use this social media site to reach millions of young voters. She says, \"They were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"</p><p>Tonight's panel is back, Adrienne Elrod, former director of strategic communications for Hillary Clinton. Charlie Hurt, the opinion editor for The Washington Times and a Fox News contributor. And Katie Pavlich, Fox News Contributor and Townhall.com, editor. Welcome back, panel.</p><p>I want to read something that is posted now by the vice president and deputy general counsel of Facebook. He says this, \"The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"</p><p>But apparently, the problem came when they realize this information wasn't being used as they thought it was going to be for academic purposes, but instead, was being used for political targeting by a Trump connected campaign consultant. Charlie, what do you make at the controversy?</p><p>HURT: Well, it's kind of funny because, of course, I remember back in 2004, when Howard Dean was first doing some of this data mining, and he was Harold as a hero. I have seen in 2008, and 2012, everybody was marveled at Obama's ability to use this kind of data mining, this kind of data to reach voters.</p><p>And of course, as soon as Donald Trump does it, it then becomes a scandal. And then, everybody starts talking about needing to curb it, or regulate it, or whatever. But the truth of the matter is, that's the business these people are in. They're in the business of collecting people's personal data, selling it to people to be mined so that people can advertise or do whatever.</p><p>BREAM: Katie, are we talking about apples and oranges here because the Obama information was collected and people knew that they were doing something to support the Obama campaign versus the situation here people maybe weren't told that their information would be used for political purposes but at least the ones who downloaded and started working with this app did say that they would give up certain information about the city they lived in and some of their friends and contacts on Facebook. They just didn't know how it was ultimately going to be used.</p><p>PAVLICH: Look, it may be apples and oranges in terms of the direct comparison about how the Obama team and Trump team used the data and what people who voluntarily gave the information were told in the fine print which I'm sure we all read the fine print in those agreements, right, about exactly what we're giving up. I think that this is actually being overblown. The fact is we live in an environment now where big tech runs the world and all of our data is up for fair game. They use it to target us for advertising, they use it to target us politically. You're smart T.V. is listening to you and they can tell you what you need to buy next week when you go shopping. I mean, I understand that people feel violated but at the same time, this is how tech companies make their money. If we're going to use their services for free, they are then going to use you and your data to make them lots of money.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and Adrienne, I mean, Facebook says they've launched an investigation and their concern was from the -- I believe it was about270,000 original people who agreed to this app, they somehow mind this for either -- based on the estimates, 30 to 15 million other Facebook users information. Do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of this?</p><p>ELROD: Yes, look, I agree first of all with Katie that look, anytime you sign up for Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, any sort of social media platform, you should assume that your data will be mined in some way shape or form. There's always the fine print that none of us ever actually read in full when you signed up for these things. But ultimately people do expect their data to be protected in a certain level. I do think Congress needs to have a little bit more oversight of some of these social media companies. You know, in the case of - in the case of Facebook, Facebook has gotten away with alot. We saw a lot of ads you know, \"fake news\" that moved across the platform during the 2016 campaign. I think they need to be a little bit more regulated and I think Congress will look into this.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and some of that fake news from -- well, from all different angles and all different sides of many different issues. And apparently, there are folks on both sides of the aisle tonight calling for more answers from Facebook and other media companies who may be hold up here again on Capitol Hill. And won't that be interesting? In the meantime, Adrienne, Charlie, Katie, great to have you with us tonight.</p><p>PAVLICH: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HURT: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>ELROD: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, persuader in chief? Well, the man who created Dilbert, cartoonist, and satirist Scott Adams analyzes the President's tweets with some interesting insights. He's live next</p><p>BREAM: The President's weekend Twitter tirade against Special Counsel Robert Mueller fueling criticism on the left to say he's abusing his power. Well, the tweets also capturing the attention of our next guest. Scott Adams is the Author of Win Bigly, Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter. But you may know him better as the creator of the comic strip Dilbert. Scott, great to have you with us tonight.</p><p>SCOTT ADAMS, CREATOR, DILBERT: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BREAM: Now, listen, you are somebody who predicted a long time ago that President Trump would be President Trump. I mean, you saw something in his messaging and the way he related to people and you say he's still doing it. What's your analysis of him?</p><p>ADAMS: Yes, I've got a background in hypnosis and I've studied persuasion for decades as part of my job and I see in him more persuasion power than I've ever seen in one human being. It's a collection of skills that all work together to be very persuasive.</p><p>BREAM: All right.</p><p>ADAMS: And you're probably going to ask about the tweets, the recent tweets. I feel that's coming.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, because you've got some reaction to them and you say that you know, people may be missing the bigger point with him and the way that he creates a message and what he's doing long-term.</p><p>ADAMS: Yes, you see in his recent tweets about McCabe and Comey and Mueller that he's doing the same thing he did successfully with I think with Judge Curiel which is he called out potential bias. I mean, it doesn't matter if there's real bias or not. As a legal persuasion strategy, it's really good to call it out and put that in everybody's mind. It does two things. If the - of the decision goes against him, well, then he's got a ready-made excuse and he can say look, I called out the bias. But in the legal system, and you see this with the Mueller investigation as you saw it with Judge Curiel, there are number of decisions always, they go in this gray area and can go either way.</p><p>And when you put that much pressure on somebody to say it looks like you might be biased, and that's what he's doing with the case of -- you know, you see McCabe and Comey and Mueller all being lumped together for this lack of credibility persuasion. So no matter which way it goes, he's got a little bit of -- a little bit of safety there because he can say well, they were biased. But more importantly, they probably will be making decisions, Mueller in this case, that could go either way, and this puts a lot of pressure on him to not even have the appearance of bias. I mean, it's really solid persuasion even though it's making people pretty excited.</p><p>BREAM: It is, both sides of the isle and of both sides of all of these issues. What's interesting to me, in a review of your new book, from the piece reading into it, it said this. It said, \"Among the drivers of human decision-making are reality filters like confirmation bias with which we interpret new data to uphold what we already believe.\" And then they quote from the book saying, \"Confirmation bias isn't an occasional bug in our human operating system, it is the operating system.\" So with that in mind, is there any room for persuasion now?</p><p>ADAMS: Yes, persuasion is pretty much all that's happening. You know, we humans ignore facts but we think we don't. So the great illusion of life is that we're rational beings making rational decisions most of the time. But when you become a hypnotist, the first thing you learn is that that's backwards and that mostly we are deciding based on our team come our feelings, our emotions, irrational reasons we make our decision and then we rationalize it no matter how tortured that rationalization is.</p><p>BREAM: Well, the idea of hypnosis and persuasion is fascinating. The book is really interesting. And for people who want to watch on Twitter, that's a lot of fun and also you break down the Presidents tweets and do a lot of your own videos that are very interesting. So I didn't know you did that, but you're multitalented. So thanks for dropping in on us, Scott. Great to meet you.</p><p>ADAMS: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Putin wins re-election, no surprise there but did his supporters actually, I mean, for real, stuff the ballot box? Well, we report, you decide. It's next.</p><p>BREAM: Vladimir Putin has ruled Russia since 1999. He won re-election this past weekend and will be present for the next six years. He won 76 percent of the vote. Who were those 24 percent? All right, but take a look at this video from one of the voting stations. Check out the guy, you see him highlighted putting what appears to be more than one ballot into the box. And as he walks away, check it out, looks pretty pleased, sort of a Russian high five with another gentleman and then, later on, he comes by again with another ballot into the box. Now, listen, we don't know if he was helping people out. He was putting in ballots for someone else. I don't know. We report, you decide. There's the video. Decide for yourself. All right, most watched, most trusted, and most grateful that you spent the evening with us here in Washington. Good night. We'll see you tomorrow night at 11:00 for FOX NEWS @NIGHT. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The biotech entrepreneur should be with his track record, having helped to build reams of successful life sciences businesses. However, even he can't muster enthusiasm about the upcoming general election.</p><p>\"Like many people, I've become disillusioned with politics over the last few years,\" he shrugs. \"It's sort of sad.\"</p><p>Across Cambridge, a hub for the UK's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/02/city-fears-corbyn-johnson-has-failed-capitalise/\">brightest technology and life sciences companies</url>, there is a similar frustration - a murmuring sense of disaffection.</p><p>Another election isn't exactly what they want. \"It's almost like a double negative,\" AstraZeneca's Andy Williams explains. \"Basically it just gets in the way of business continuity and [brings] potential uncertainty.\"</p><p>Among research institutes in the city, he says, there is a \"nervousness rather than actual negativity at the moment\".</p><p>Nervousness, of course, because an election brings with it uncertainty. But, this time around, it's more than that.</p><p>The technology industry is estimated to bring in more than \u00a3180bn to the UK economy, life sciences around \u00a330bn, and both create <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/02/city-fears-corbyn-johnson-has-failed-capitalise/\">jobs at a rate which outstrips many other sectors</url>. And yet, it appears \"there isn't a natural ally necessarily anywhere in the political spectrum at the moment,\" Edward Benthall, chairman of Cambridge venture firm Cambridge Innovation Capital, says.</p><p>Brexit is a major sticking point. Prior to the referendum almost 90pc of the tech sector was opposed to leaving the EU, and concerns over how the life sciences supply chain will function has weighed heavy on pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>Almost three quarters of Cambridge voters wanted to remain in the EU in 2016, making backing a pro-Brexit party an uncomfortable proposition for many residents.</p><p>For some, it is entirely dictating their vote. \"The main problem is what type of Brexit, if any, we get,\" says Hermann Hauser, partner at venture firm Amadeus Capital Partners. \"If the outcome was another referendum, I think that would improve things enormously. From a commercial point of view, that is by far the most desirable outcome.\"</p><p>But, outside of Brexit, there are other, equally uncomfortable choices to be made.</p><p>\"There isn't really a party that champions wealth <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/02/city-fears-corbyn-johnson-has-failed-capitalise/\">creation through innovation</url>, and that does feel a bit awkward,\" says Benthall.</p><p>\"I can't quite believe that any of the parties really would see the growth of jobs and value that happens around Cambridge as anything other than a good thing, but for some reason, it doesn't seem easy for them to champion that case.\"</p><p>More widely, there have been major pushes from both sides of the political debate to take on big tech - plans for digital services taxes on US giants, or to make the Silicon Valley firms pay for a part-nationalisation of BT.</p><p>But closer to home, British companies are warning that there are policies across the board which could hurt their ability to innovate, and prove potential roadblocks for growth.</p><p>One area of<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/02/city-fears-corbyn-johnson-has-failed-capitalise/\">concern is around entrepreneurs relief</url> - a tax break which reduces the amount of capital gains tax that business owners have to pay when they sell a business.</p><p>According to their manifestos, if the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats come into power, the relief will be scrapped. If the Conservatives do, a \"review and reform\" is planned.</p><p>And, yet, while there appears cross-party backing of some change to the tax break, doing so could be \"pretty damaging\" for innovators, says Benthall. </p><p>\"It's much harder to start a new company than it is to work for an existing incumbent player, so they deserve the relief that they get and that needs to be maintained.\"</p><p>Steve Chandler, a former entrepreneur who is now at venture capital firm Notion Capital, agrees. \"Whilst I'm open to tightening requirements to ensure it does what was intended, anything that curtails entrepreneurial risk appetite at that end of the market is a negative in my view.\"</p><p>There are other policies on the table which are causing some concern - Labour's plans to establish a \"generic drug company\", for example, has prompted alarm within the life sciences sector. </p><p>How it would work, the party says, is that if companies did not set \"fair prices\" for patented drugs, the UK would then be able to secure access to generic versions of those drugs through things such as research exemptions.</p><p>But this could prove \"very dangerous,\" says Richards. The UK \"acts as a very small part of the pharmaceuticals market\", and establishing a new generics company here \"would rip up global international trade positions in intellectual property\".</p><p>It could also make the business case for developing such drugs less attractive, hurting innovation in the sector.</p><p>One of the things which is \"important for life sciences research and industry development, is the commercialisation of intellectual property,\" says Alan Hirzel, the boss of London-listed Abcam. </p><p>It creates an environment where there are clusters of spin-out companies from universities, essential for the next generation of commercial talent. \"We'd like to keep that kind of environment here,\" says Hirzel.</p><p>Ultimately keeping the status quo is high on the list of demands of many of the companies in the region.</p><p>Recent years have seen major initiatives, such as the Industrial Strategy, prove hugely beneficial to a whole host of companies across the technology and life sciences industries, not only in helping to foster innovation, but then in propelling them into the public sphere.</p><p>Specific sector deals for artificial intelligence, life sciences and automotive have seen more taxpayer cash funnelled into companies developing new, ground-breaking technology. </p><p>Alongside that, businesses have flourished in Cambridge - according to data from Centre for Cities, the city has the highest proportion of patent applications for the residents who live there, and is now home to six billion-dollar companies. </p><p>Last year, almost \u00a3500m was invested by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/02/city-fears-corbyn-johnson-has-failed-capitalise/\">venture capitalists into Cambridge-based businesses</url>, and as well as attracting giants AstraZeneca, Microsoft and Amazon, there are thousands of exciting smaller companies dotted around the city.</p><p>\"It's about preserving what we've got,\" says Clive Morris, the boss of liquid biopsy firm Inivata.</p><p>He says he doesn't really mind who wins the election - \"as long as they're accommodating to life sciences\".</p><p>In fact, taking a hands-off approach could be the best solution for a future government, some say. \"Let those of us who want to build businesses in the UK get on with it,\" urges Martin Frost, the boss of CMR Surgical, a robotics business which recently became a \"unicorn\", valued at more than $1bn. \"Technology needs, I would say, little government and few rules.\"</p><p>Where rules could, perhaps, be the most damaging would be on immigration, which is a major part of both the life sciences and technology sector.</p><p>Around 45pc of the UK tech sector's net employment growth is made up of workers from overseas and there have been warnings that tougher regulation of immigration could cause a worsening of skill shortages in life science.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley wealth was created through immigration to California,\" Frost says. \"It would be disappointing if we were to become more monoculture.\"</p><p>Perhaps equally challenging would be any pressure on R&amp;D funding - although, so far, this seems a point on which many of the major parties are united.</p><p>\"Labour will create an innovation nation,\" the party said, tabling plans to hike direct support for R&amp;D and better \"crowd in\" private investment.</p><p>The Conservatives, meanwhile, are looking to set up a new funding agency, styled in the fashion of Washington's Darpa. They've pledged to continue to work with the EU on scientific research, including Horizon - the EU's main research programme which has been at the centre of much concern by start-ups.</p><p>Taking into account questions over Brexit, immigration, tax changes and any R&amp;D policies, what becomes clear is that this is an election which could upend the life sciences and technology industries.</p><p>There is an \"awful lot\" that needs to be resolved, CIC's Benthall says. Not only is it \"very unclear what the outcome is going to be, but it's also quite unclear what happens in any of the possible outcomes\".</p><p>Whilst it is apparent this is viewed as a hugely important election, many in the city don't really know what to think. </p><p>\"I'm interested, engaged, a bit anxious... but mostly a bit confused probably,\" says Benthall. \"It really matters. And it matters a lot to what's going on here in Cambridge.\"</p><p>                       In part 4, we visit the UK's automotive heartlands - the West Midlands - and speak to politically disaffected and disengaged SME business leaders who all yearn for a clear and coherent industrial strategy.                   </p><p>                       What does your business and others in your region want from the main political parties this election?

Amazon's domination in business industry in many parts of the country has made a huge impact to the public especially to the people in Seattle where cost of living has skyrocketed because housing prices are up along with a whole bunch of commodities; Amazon bought the Washington Post in 2013 which added more leverage to its very wealthy CEO, Jeff Bezos.

Now, were some of these companies who went out of business going out of business anyways? Yes.

His mother, Jackie Gise was a junior in high school when she and her boyfriend, Ted Jorgensen became parents.</p><p>BEZOS: She doesn't talk about it that much. But my mom had me when she was 17 years old. You could ask her. But I'm pretty sure that wasn't cool in 1964 to be a pregnant mom in high school.</p><p>HARLOW: But by the time Jeff turned two, his mother and Jorgensen, a circus performer and unicyclist, had split up. And Jackie was left to raise her son on her own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSHUA WEINSTEIN, JEFF BEZOS' CHILDHOOD FRIEND: Look at Jeff.</p><p>HARLOW: Aw!</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Look at that hair and the glasses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: One of Bezos' closest friends from high school, Joshua Weinstein, remembers Jackie as a loving and determined mother.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Jackie is the toughest, hardest working person I've ever met, and the most loyal, and Jeff gets that from - from Jackie.</p><p>STONE: Jackie Bezos was clearly the force in - in Jeff's life, a fiercely protective mother who got Jeff into the best schools, and got him the best opportunities. And she also recognized, I think, Jeff's abilities early on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Jackie and Jeff wouldn't be a family of two for long. Soon, Jackie would fall in love with a Cuban immigrant named Miguel Bezos. They married when Jeff was four.</p><p>BEZOS: My father adopted me when I was about four years old. I have the world's best dad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Science Whiz Jeff Bezos is an outstanding student, emphasizing high standards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos' academic ambitions would lead him to the top of his high school class, and then to Princeton University.</p><p>BEZOS: I went to Princeton specifically to study physics, but a couple of years into it I realized that I wasn't smart enough to be a physicist. And then I transferred to computer science and electrical engineering, which I loved, and never looked back.</p><p>HARLOW: After College, Bezos landed on Wall Street, at the quantitative hedge fund, D. E. Shaw, where he would meet his soon-to- be wife, MacKenzie.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEINSTEIN: He called me up one day, and he said \"I'm getting married.\" I said, \"Great! To who?\" And he told me all about her.</p><p>HARLOW: Really?</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Just six months after they began dating, Bezos and MacKenzie were married. And Bezos continued to rise through the ranks at D. E. Shaw, where he began to explore a burgeoning new medium, the internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It spans the globe like a superhighway. It is called internet. BEZOS: I started looking at the internet, and I found this incredible startling fact.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Jeff Bezos saw that web activity had jumped 230,000 percent in a short period of time. That was the ding, ding, ding in his head.</p><p>STONE: Yes. I think he was able to see very early, you know, that the web was growing, that people were embracing it, and that it would create a whole set of new business opportunities.</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Jeff called me, and he said, \"MacKenzie and I are quitting our jobs, and we're moving to Seattle, and we're starting a company.\" And I said, \"Great! Well what are you going to do?\" He said, \"We're going to sell books.\" I said, \"Nice!\" He said, \"On the internet.\" I said \"Cool! What's the internet?\"</p><p>HARLOW: In 1994, then 30-year-old Jeff Bezos ditched his lucrative Wall Street job, borrowed his father's car, and drove with his wife MacKenzie to Bellevue, Washington, just outside Seattle. And inside that garage, Jeff Bezos started his own company, an online bookstore. And by the end of the year, that company had a name, Amazon.</p><p>JENNIFER CAST, VICE PRESIDENT, SPECIALTY RECRUITING, AMAZON: I went to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.amazon.com\">www.amazon.com</url>, and started searching for books, and was immediately hooked.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Jennifer Cast would become Amazon's 25th employee.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you for calling amazon.com.

You got off the furniture.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Tell people what door desks are. Was it truly frugal, to save money?</p><p>HART: It was frugal. That - that - that was exactly how it started, was frugality, but also it's a good symbol of the mindset that Jeff wanted to create. We had to be resourceful and creative.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But in order to expand beyond books, way beyond books, Bezos needed capital, and a lot of it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Amazon.com jumped $5.5 on its first day of trading.</p><p>HARLOW: So, in May of 1997, in the middle of the dot-com frenzy, Amazon went public.</p><p>BEZOS: What's really incredible about this is that this is day one. This is the very beginning. This is the Kitty Hawk stage of electronic commerce.</p><p>HARLOW: \"Day one, it's always day one\" became the Bezos' mantra. In his first letter to shareholders, Bezos sketched out the foundation of Amazon. It's all about the long-term.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STONE: I like and I'll tell Babe Ruth kind of calling his home run shot, it was audacious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos would stick to that long-term thinking, even during Amazon's toughest times.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Amazon's stock has lost much of its luster.</p><p>HARLOW: After the dot-com bubble burst, Amazon stock price tumbled.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Investors ran for the exits.</p><p>HARLOW: Losing more than 90 percent of its value in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STONE: There were famous analysts who said Amazon would run out of money.

I think it's great.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILKE: I grew up as a programmer, that's me.</p><p>HARLOW: Jeff Wilke has been with Amazon for 20 years, and rarely gives television interviews. He's now one of Bezos' top executives.</p><p>WILKE: We have essentially an assembly process.</p><p>HARLOW: But back in 1999, when Wilke first joined Amazon, he used his background in manufacturing to transform Amazon delivery into what would become Amazon Prime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: You guys didn't even know if this thing was going to work, right?</p><p>WILKE: Prime?</p><p>HARLOW: True? WILKE: No. We didn't know for sure that customers would love it, but we had a pretty good instinct.</p><p>HARLOW: Both of you, both Jeffs, are big risk-takers. Is that right?</p><p>WILKE: I think so. I think Prime, at the time, was a big risk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Today, it's estimated that more than half of U.S. households are Prime members.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: What should that tell us about how important Prime is to Amazon's success?</p><p>WILKE: I think it's very important. But it's not the only thing that's important for our success.</p><p>HARLOW: They say about you that you're the most powerful man in the Cloud.

Do you like that description?</p><p>JASSY: I don't think of it that way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: In the heart of Amazon's Seattle campus, I met with Andy Jassy, one of Jeff Bezos' top leaders, the CEO of AWS, the man who built Amazon's Cloud.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASSY: We're in The Spheres, which is kind of an amazing place when you look around. There are 700 species and 40,000 different plants in here. It's a place that Amazonians can come and do work. It's really nice to be able to get away from what you're doing every day and be inspired by what's around you.</p><p>HARLOW: Whose idea was this?</p><p>JASSY: I think it was Jeff's idea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: But Amazon Web Services, that was Jassy's idea, an idea so powerful, it is now perhaps Amazon's most valuable business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STONE: It generates an unusual amount of margin for Amazon.</p><p>HARLOW: The best margins for Amazon. Period!</p><p>STONE: Yes. And it's really almost single-handedly kind of changed enterprise computing.</p><p>HARLOW: I think it is fair to say many people watching this have no idea what AWS is. Where did it come from?</p><p>JASSY: There were a few things going on, I'll - I'll call it between 2000-2003, that made us think that this was an interesting idea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Most notably, Jassy realized that in order to continue expanding and experimenting at a pace their leader had come to expect, Amazon's computing technology would have to move a lot faster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASSY: If you need a server to try and experiment, it typically takes you 10 to 18 weeks to get that server. With the Cloud, you can - you can spin out thousands of servers in minutes. So, we figured if we needed it, it was probably likely that a lot of other companies needed it as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: In the same way that Amazon transformed the speed of shipping physical products, AWS has done the same for data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: The Cloud is not up there. It's, you know, in machines, sitting on the ground, all around the world, and they're just storing all this content, and shipping it out to web users.</p><p>HARLOW: What strikes me is that it worked, and then you essentially had a seven-year lead on all your competitors.</p><p>JASSY: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEZOS: This is like the greatest piece of business luck in the history of business, so far, as I know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Why did no one follow quickly? JASSY: It's a really good question. And I don't know if we know the answer for sure.</p><p>In the beginning, a lot of companies would pooh-pooh the cloud, and say that nobody was going to use it for anything interesting. And when the value proposition is that good for consumers, you can howl at the wind all you want, but you can't fight gravity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[21:30:00] HARLOW: 13 years later, the Cloud is now a $70 billion industry. And while formidable competitors have emerged, Amazon continues to dominate with a seemingly endless list of customers, from Fortune 500 companies to tech start-ups, to yes, CNN, even secretive government agencies, including the CIA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: The Cloud is crucial to the economy. It's now crucial to national security. Do you think there should be more federal regulation of it?</p><p>JASSY: Governments are going to make their own decisions on what they feel like they need to regulate and what they feel like they don't need to regulate. And we expect that governments will - will want to understand how we're operating, as more and more workloads are being put on top of AWS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: For now, the federal government is busy deciding how much more of the nation's most sensitive data it wants to place in Amazon's hands. AWS is a final contender for the JEDI contract, a $10 billion Pentagon deal that would involve hosting government data for operations critical to military missions across the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASSY: We think it's integral for the Department of Defense to have access to the most sophisticated cutting-edge technology that exist. Period!</p><p>HARLOW: Does having that much power give you pause?</p><p>JASSY: We have over 3,000 government agencies using AWS in a significant way. That's a significant responsibility. We're aware of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But most Americans are not aware of the extent to which our government, our economy, and our homes now rely on Amazon.</p><p>REID: Alexa, popcorn.</p><p>ALEXA: Starting popcorn.

Why?</p><p>REID: It's so natural. This is our natural user interface.</p><p>WEBB: Voice is going to quickly emerge as one of the primary ways that we interface with machines.

We paid $2.6 billion in cash taxes in the last three years. If last year, we paid no tax in the U.S., it was because the law required us to pay no tax.

We have one today in Seattle.</p><p>HARLOW: Since 2010, the number of homeless in Seattle has increased nearly 34 percent. To address the crisis, the city council proposed a head tax in 2017 that would tax Seattle's biggest companies $275 per employee.

If you want something that is socially beneficial, we are going to have to fight for it as ordinary people.

No one else has that.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I wish them luck. It's going to be a beauty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and the other Washington. DONALD GRAHAM, OWNER &amp; CHAIRMAN, GRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANY: I think ownership of the Post has risks for Amazon as well as benefits.</p><p>[22:10:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: It was 2013 and one of the country's leading newspapers was in serious trouble.</p><p>GRAHAM: The 2008 financial crisis was devastating. We'd been through a lot of recessions, but we'd never seen anything like this.</p><p>The Washington Post had been owned by the Graham family since 1933 but now it was struggling to survive.</p><p>GRAHAM: I was trying to figure out how a newspaper that had been successful in print could be successful in the digital world.</p><p>HARLOW: So, Don Graham, chairman of the Post at the time, talked to everyone he could in Silicon Valley.</p><p>GRAHAM: I talked to Steve Jobs. I talked to Gates. I talked to Mark Zuckerberg. I talked to the founders of Google. I talked to Jeff. Over and over again. I remember that it was smart, sensible, and not full of himself.</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos came with the influential endorsement of Warren Buffet.</p><p>GRAHAM: Warren at that time was on our board. And Warren said Jeff Bezos is the best CEO in the United States.</p><p>HARLOW: Really?</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Graham made an offer and Bezos took it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In a surprise move the Washington Post is being sold to the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON.COM INC.: It is the newspaper in the capital city of the most important country in the world. The Washington Post has an incredibly important role to play in this democracy. I know that when I'm 90, it's going to be one of the things I'm most proud of.</p><p>HARLOW: But skeptics wondered if Bezos had a different strategy at play.</p><p>[22:14:57] SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: I think his intentions are good. Republican billionaires buy football teams. Democratic billionaires buy newspapers.</p><p>But it's also a pretty decent heat shield and prophylactic against antitrust because if a liberal newspaper is not in favor of antitrust against Bezos, it's just a fantastic way to put sheep's clothing around a wolf.</p><p>HARLOW: And over the next five years, Bezos invested even more in the nation's capital, purchasing the largest home in the city, choosing its suburbs for Amazon's second headquarters, and spending more on lobbying than any other tech company so far this year.</p><p>STELTER: Amazon is one of the single most influential companies in Washington.</p><p>HARLOW: Do you think owning the Washington Post has given Bezos more clout among the political class here in Washington?</p><p>GRAHAM: No. As the owner of Amazon, Jeff could hardly have more clout if he wanted to exercise it. But I see no evidence that Jeff is using the Washington Post to advance any political interest.</p><p>HARLOW: And current executives at the Post have stated repeatedly that Bezos is not involved in any editorial decisions.</p><p>Has it ever been a concern for you at all that the interest of Amazon could have motivated the purchase of the Post?</p><p>GRAHAM: I suppose that's possible but I think ownership of the Post has risks for Amazon as well as benefits. The risk is that when the Post writes a negative article about a politician, about a government, it can make people unhappy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think the Washington Post is a Russian asset. It's put there for the benefit, the Washington Post, of Amazon. That's my opinion and I think it's a disgrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: President Trump has made a habit of hurling unsubstantiated allegations at Amazon and Bezos on Twitter, accusing him of lobbying through the Washington Post. Calling the paper fake news and claiming Amazon is scamming the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>What started the beef between President Trump and Jeff Bezos?</p><p>STELTER: I think fundamentally this is about the Washington Post, it's a very influential newspaper. It's a paper that covers Trump very critically, and rightly so. As a result, Trump lashes out.</p><p>GRAHAM: I have seen other presidents do the same thing.</p><p>(BEGIN VOICE CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD NIXON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: From now on, no reporter from the Washington Post is ever to be in the White House. Is that clear?</p><p>(END VOICE CLIP) GRAHAM: There was a man named Richard M. Nixon who was very direct and very personal in what he felt about the Washington Post so President Trump is doing what an awful lot of politicians have done over the years.</p><p>HARLOW: Earlier this year Trump also took aim at Bezos' personal life after the National Enquirer leaked revealing text messages between Bezos and the woman he was seeing just one day after he'd announced his separation from his wife, Mackenzie. President Trump weighed in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I wish him luck. It's going to be a beauty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos wrote in a medium post that he suspected politics might be in play in the Enquirer's reporting.</p><p>STELTER: And he wanted to say so publicly. The Enquirer came to him and said we have all these photos and we could share it unless you stop accusing us of political motivations. So, the magazine wanted to shut Bezos up.</p><p>HARLOW: But instead, Bezos released e-mails from the Enquirer to his team and accused them of blackmail and extortion.</p><p>BRAD STONE, AUTHOR, THE EVERYTHING STORE: I was shocked. I think a lot of people around him were shocked, you know. This is not someone whose personal life had drawn a lot of attention.</p><p>HARLOW: No.</p><p>STONE: And that was a situation that was extraordinary.</p><p>HARLOW: In a statement, the tabloid told CNN, quote, \"The National Enquirer acted lawfully and stands by the accuracy of our reporting.\"</p><p>STELTER: I think to this day it is still a mystery about exactly what happened with the Enquirer.</p><p>HARLOW: Yet the scandal placed Bezos in an entirely new light.</p><p>STONE: I think he thought and probably believed pretty strongly that he was doing the right thing. By confronting this - this abusive media power.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I think it was handled brilliantly. And I think there's a reservoir of goodwill towards Jeff Bezos because he's been seen as a responsible steward of the Washington Post. So, I think his personal reputation has probably never been stronger.</p><p>HARLOW: The medium post I think that surprised everyone with very serious allegations of blackmail. I'm interested if that has affected Amazon at all and if it has changed at all how he leads Amazon. WILKE: It hasn't changed how he leads. Jeff is as engaged as he's been for years. His ideas are just as clever. I've watched him give messages to our teams, and all-hands meetings, and smaller group messages, and the messages are spot-on. They're aligned with our culture and our leadership principles. He's the same Jeff that I've worked alongside for 20 years and I hope he stays the same Jeff.</p><p>[22:10:01] HARLOW: Coming up, the future of Amazon.</p><p>AMY WEBB, AUTHOR, THE BIG NINE: It's plausible that Amazon will pretty soon know you better than your spouse does, better than your kids do, better than you know yourself.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, command start.</p><p>HARLOW: In 2015 --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Engine running.</p><p>HARLOW: -- Jeff Bezos took a giant leap into a new frontier.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And liftoff.</p><p>HARLOW: Jeff Bezos recently said that Blue Origin, his space venture, is the most important thing he's working on. Why?</p><p>STONE: Because I think he thinks of it as a long-term solution for humanity's biggest problems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEZOS: It's time to go back to the moon, this time to stay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos is now spending a billion dollars a year of his own money exploring space. And while his rocket ships don't say Amazon today, that may change sooner than we think.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And liftoff.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Think we'll ever have Amazon fulfillment centers on the moon?</p><p>BEZOS: That's a very good question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Amazon recently won a patent for a floating warehouse that could store drones 45,000 feet into space. One of many strangers than fiction ideas Amazon has in the works. [22:25:02] WEBB: They're deep in research now on recognizing not only who you are but what you are in that moment in time.</p><p>HARLOW: According to Bloomberg, Amazon is working on a wearable device that can read human emotions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Voice profiles give you the ability to teach Alexa your voice.</p><p>WEBB: Using a baseline of your biometrics --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexa, close the shades, please.</p><p>WEBB: You know, are you depressed?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, tell Roomba to start cleaning.</p><p>WEBB: Are you happy?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexa, what time is it?</p><p>WEBB: Are you manic? Have you had a stroke and don't realize it yet? Do you have early onset Parkinson's?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, turn the TV on.</p><p>WEBB: These are all discoverable if there's a big enough database of your voice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, tell my coffee machine to prepare --</p><p>STONE: Health care is clearly in the next big business they want to offer. They acquired this company called Pill Pack which distributes drugs.</p><p>WEBB: It's your medication made easy.</p><p>STONE: They're working on ways to turn Alexa into a doctor in your home.</p><p>WEBB: It's plausible that Amazon or any of the other big tech companies will pretty soon know you better than your spouse does, better than your kids or parents do, better than you know yourself. Or you're willing to admit.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Amazon knows our food intake. It knows our body mass index because of the clothes we're wearing. It knows if we're in a monogamous relationship. It knows how many kids we have.</p><p>HARLOW: The question is, what is Amazon doing with all that information?</p><p>WILKE: When you search for something, artificial intelligence is making the search result better than it used to be. When we show you the list of recommendations that are personalized for you, that result is improved by artificial intelligence. HARLOW: A.I. has also improved Amazon's long-awaited drone delivery system.</p><p>WILKE: You have to be really good at this so that customers can trust it completely. Regulators can trust --</p><p>HARLOW: You have to make the drone even smarter.</p><p>WILKE: Yes. Sixty to 80 percent of the items that we shipped could be shipped by the drones that we're working on.</p><p>HARLOW: But all of that convenience, experts say, could come at exponentially higher cost to our privacy.</p><p>WEBB: In the case, for example, of Amazon, Amazon has incredibly powerful image recognition technology.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People really love this image recognition service.</p><p>WEBB: At the moment, we don't have any caselaw that answers the question, who owns your face?</p><p>HARLOW: Yet, Amazon's facial recognition software is already being used by law enforcement across the country, drawing criticism from the ACLU.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's think about what those powers cold mean in the hands of the government.</p><p>HARLOW: And Amazon's own employees who say the powerful technology must be carefully regulated before it's put to broad use.</p><p>You have been pretty open about the fact that this is a service that could do harm, in your words. There have been concerns about racial and gender discrimination. How do you protect against that?</p><p>JASSY: We give pretty clear guidance to the law enforcement agencies that they should only use the predictions that come back from our facial recognition technology if they have confidence levels of at least 99 percent and then only as one element of a human-driven decision.</p><p>But I also understand why people are concerned and I also think that it's very reasonable for governments to put regulations in place that provide extra guidelines for how the technology should be used.</p><p>HARLOW: But what if the problem is not the user but the artificial intelligence taking over all of big tech and its potential for bias?</p><p>WEBB: Women of color are far more likely to have the secondary screening at an airport than men or Caucasian women because you look like an anomaly to a system that for the most part was built by a whole bunch of people who maybe aren't racist but never occurred to them --</p><p>HARLOW: A whole bunch of white men. WEBB: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: One reason another tech giant, Google, has been hesitant to bring this technology to market so swiftly.</p><p>Google has chosen, at least for now, not to sell facial recognition technologies while your competitors like Amazon are moving full steam ahead.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: We realize there are potential cases in which there isn't a clear regulatory framework around how technology can be used. That gives us pause.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As opposed to some companies who are backing away from supporting the government, we are unwavering in our support to serve government.</p><p>HARLOW: Is it worth to given what Amazon has brought to the world?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, the question is, is Amazon a net good? A 100 percent yes, but the problem is with the word, \"net.\" Fossil fuels are a net positive for society but we still have emission standards. Pesticides are a net positive for us but we still have an FDA.</p><p>Amazon has been a net positive. Does that mean they shouldn't be broken up when they become noncompetitive? No, they should be broken up.</p><p>[22:30:04] WEBB: I would argue that if you force these companies to break apart, you could say that that's a national security issue because, quite frankly, we all rely on these companies. We need Amazon, we need Google, we need Apple, we need Microsoft. So the question is, where do we go from here?</p><p>BEZOS: My view on this is very simple: all big institutions of any kind are going to be, and should be, examined, scrutinized, inspected.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got customers to serve.</p><p>HARLOW: Twenty-five years since the age of Amazon began, Bezos's bookstore is an American institution. And scrutiny is exactly what it's getting.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-RI: So you're telling us here, under oath, that Amazon doesn't use any of that data to favor Amazon products.</p><p>HARLOW: From its ever-expanding size to its impact on the planet. Yet nothing is slowing Amazon down.</p><p>(on camera) Is it unparalleled?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: There's only a handful of so many things that have grown like this, and been in so many businesses, and invented so many things, and invented their own technolopgy to accomplish what they want to do. It's still a growing machine. WEBB: Jeff Bezos is a visionary. And you can question whether or not every decision being made is in the right one for what's in the best interest of humanty, but I cannot think of very many other people alive or in recent history that are as capable or as gifted in long- range thinking as Bezos is.</p><p>BEZOS: We're now big enough to hurt this planet. We have to use the resources of space. When that is possible, when the infrastructure is in place, just as it was for me in 1994 to start Amazon, you will see amazing things happen. And it will happen very fast. I guarantee it.</p><p>[22:30:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019081601CNV54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV7-NP11-JB20-G2GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0003SRP</classCode><className>MITCHELL CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL SELF-RELIANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>SIC2431 MILLWORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Amazon is \"Arguably the most successful company in the history of business,\" and \"Now the only firm in the world that can really perform consistently what I refer to as Jedi mind tricks,\" says Marketing Professor, Scott Galloway. Amazon's \"Culture is the primary reason I remain here,\" and \"A place where you're encouraged to think creatively,\" says Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services. Amazon's domination in business industry in many parts of the country has made a huge impact to the public especially to the people in Seattle where cost of living has skyrocketed because housing prices are up along with a whole bunch of commodities; Amazon bought the Washington Post in 2013 which added more leverage to its very wealthy CEO, Jeff Bezos. Bezos' personal life was dragged into controversies but that did not stop him from dreaming more. Bezos is now focusing on his passion in outer space and making more projections for the future through advance technology and artificial intelligence.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[23:00:00] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The following is a CNN Special Report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TEXT: A CNN SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, who are you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, CEO, &amp; PRESIDENT OF AMAZON: I'm Jeff Bezos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is your claim to fame?</p><p>BEZOS: I'm the Founder of Amazon.com.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: What began as on online book store.</p><p>BEZOS: A millennia from now, people are going to look back and say, Wow!</p><p>HARLOW: Has become a virtual empire.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Amazon really is arguably the most successful company in the history of business.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow!

His mother, Jackie Gise was a junior in high school when she and her boyfriend, Ted Jorgensen became parents.</p><p>BEZOS: She doesn't talk about it that much. But my mom had me when she was 17 years old. You could ask her. But I'm pretty sure that wasn't cool in 1964 to be a pregnant mom in high school.</p><p>HARLOW: But by the time Jeff turned two, his mother and Jorgensen, a circus performer and unicyclist, had split up. And Jackie was left to raise her son on her own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSHUA WEINSTEIN, JEFF BEZOS' CHILDHOOD FRIEND: Look at Jeff.</p><p>HARLOW: Aw!</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Look at that hair and the glasses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: One of Bezos' closest friends from high school, Joshua Weinstein, remembers Jackie as a loving and determined mother.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Jackie is the toughest, hardest working person I've ever met, and the most loyal, and Jeff gets that from - from Jackie.</p><p>STONE: Jackie Bezos was clearly the force in - in Jeff's life, a fiercely protective mother who got Jeff into the best schools, and got him the best opportunities. And she also recognized, I think, Jeff's abilities early on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Jackie and Jeff wouldn't be a family of two for long. Soon, Jackie would fall in love with a Cuban immigrant named Miguel Bezos. They married when Jeff was four.</p><p>BEZOS: My father adopted me when I was about four years old. I have the world's best dad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Science Whiz Jeff Bezos is an outstanding student, emphasizing high standards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos' academic ambitions would lead him to the top of his high school class, and then to Princeton University.</p><p>BEZOS: I went to Princeton specifically to study physics, but a couple of years into it I realized that I wasn't smart enough to be a physicist. And then I transferred to computer science and electrical engineering, which I loved, and never looked back.</p><p>HARLOW: After College, Bezos landed on Wall Street, at the quantitative hedge fund, D. E. Shaw, where he would meet his soon-to- be wife, MacKenzie.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEINSTEIN: He called me up one day, and he said \"I'm getting married.\" I said, \"Great! To who?\" And he told me all about her.</p><p>HARLOW: Really?</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Just six months after they began dating, Bezos and MacKenzie were married. And Bezos continued to rise through the ranks at D. E. Shaw, where he began to explore a burgeoning new medium, the internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It spans the globe like a superhighway. It is called internet. BEZOS: I started looking at the internet, and I found this incredible startling fact.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Jeff Bezos saw that web activity had jumped 230,000 percent in a short period of time. That was the ding, ding, ding in his head.</p><p>STONE: Yes. I think he was able to see very early, you know, that the web was growing, that people were embracing it, and that it would create a whole set of new business opportunities.</p><p>WEINSTEIN: Jeff called me, and he said, \"MacKenzie and I are quitting our jobs, and we're moving to Seattle, and we're starting a company.\" And I said, \"Great! Well what are you going to do?\" He said, \"We're going to sell books.\" I said, \"Nice!\" He said, \"On the internet.\" I said \"Cool! What's the internet?\"</p><p>HARLOW: In 1994, then 30-year-old Jeff Bezos ditched his lucrative Wall Street job, borrowed his father's car, and drove with his wife MacKenzie to Bellevue, Washington, just outside Seattle. And inside that garage, Jeff Bezos started his own company, an online bookstore. And by the end of the year, that company had a name, Amazon.</p><p>JENNIFER CAST, VICE PRESIDENT, SPECIALTY RECRUITING, AMAZON: I went to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.amazon.com\">www.amazon.com</url>, and started searching for books, and was immediately hooked.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Jennifer Cast would become Amazon's 25th employee.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you for calling amazon.com.

That - that - that was exactly how it started, was frugality, but also it's a good symbol of the mindset that Jeff wanted to create. We had to be resourceful and creative.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But in order to expand beyond books, way beyond books, Bezos needed capital, and a lot of it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Amazon.com jumped $5.5 on its first day of trading.</p><p>HARLOW: So, in May of 1997, in the middle of the dot-com frenzy, Amazon went public.</p><p>BEZOS: What's really incredible about this is that this is day one. This is the very beginning. This is the Kitty Hawk stage of electronic commerce.</p><p>HARLOW: \"Day one, it's always day one\" became the Bezos' mantra.

Do you like that description?</p><p>JASSY: I don't think of it that way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: In the heart of Amazon's Seattle campus, I met with Andy Jassy, one of Jeff Bezos' top leaders, the CEO of AWS, the man who built Amazon's Cloud.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASSY: We're in The Spheres, which is kind of an amazing place when you look around. There are 700 species and 40,000 different plants in here. It's a place that Amazonians can come and do work. It's really nice to be able to get away from what you're doing every day and be inspired by what's around you.</p><p>HARLOW: Whose idea was this?</p><p>JASSY: I think it was Jeff's idea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: But Amazon Web Services, that was Jassy's idea, an idea so powerful, it is now perhaps Amazon's most valuable business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STONE: It generates an unusual amount of margin for Amazon.</p><p>HARLOW: The best margins for Amazon. Period!</p><p>STONE: Yes. And it's really almost single-handedly kind of changed enterprise computing.</p><p>HARLOW: I think it is fair to say many people watching this have no idea what AWS is. Where did it come from?</p><p>JASSY: There were a few things going on, I'll - I'll call it between 2000-2003, that made us think that this was an interesting idea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Most notably, Jassy realized that in order to continue expanding and experimenting at a pace their leader had come to expect, Amazon's computing technology would have to move a lot faster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASSY: If you need a server to try and experiment, it typically takes you 10 to 18 weeks to get that server. With the Cloud, you can - you can spin out thousands of servers in minutes. So, we figured if we needed it, it was probably likely that a lot of other companies needed it as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: In the same way that Amazon transformed the speed of shipping physical products, AWS has done the same for data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: The Cloud is not up there. It's, you know, in machines, sitting on the ground, all around the world, and they're just storing all this content, and shipping it out to web users.</p><p>HARLOW: What strikes me is that it worked, and then you essentially had a seven-year lead on all your competitors.</p><p>JASSY: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEZOS: This is like the greatest piece of business luck in the history of business, so far, as I know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Why did no one follow quickly? JASSY: It's a really good question. And I don't know if we know the answer for sure.</p><p>In the beginning, a lot of companies would pooh-pooh the cloud, and say that nobody was going to use it for anything interesting. And when the value proposition is that good for consumers, you can howl at the wind all you want, but you can't fight gravity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[23:30:00] HARLOW: 13 years later, the Cloud is now a $70 billion industry. And while formidable competitors have emerged, Amazon continues to dominate with a seemingly endless list of customers, from Fortune 500 companies to tech start-ups, to yes, CNN, even secretive government agencies, including the CIA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: The Cloud is crucial to the economy. It's now crucial to national security. Do you think there should be more federal regulation of it?</p><p>JASSY: Governments are going to make their own decisions on what they feel like they need to regulate and what they feel like they don't need to regulate. And we expect that governments will - will want to understand how we're operating, as more and more workloads are being put on top of AWS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: For now, the federal government is busy deciding how much more of the nation's most sensitive data it wants to place in Amazon's hands. AWS is a final contender for the JEDI contract, a $10 billion Pentagon deal that would involve hosting government data for operations critical to military missions across the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASSY: We think it's integral for the Department of Defense to have access to the most sophisticated cutting-edge technology that exist. Period!</p><p>HARLOW: Does having that much power give you pause?</p><p>JASSY: We have over 3,000 government agencies using AWS in a significant way. That's a significant responsibility. We're aware of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But most Americans are not aware of the extent to which our government, our economy, and our homes now rely on Amazon.</p><p>REID: Alexa, popcorn.</p><p>ALEXA: Starting popcorn. HARLOW: Although a vastly different kind of technology, Alexa, like the Cloud, has unleashed its own revolution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REID: We launched with 13 skills. Now we have over 80,000 skills. Alexa can actually just do over a million things.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Toni Reid has been with Amazon for 21 years, and headed Alexa's introduction to the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: You have said that voice is the technology that, in your words, we didn't know we needed. Why?</p><p>REID: It's so natural. This is our natural user interface.</p><p>WEBB: Voice is going to quickly emerge as one of the primary ways that we interface with machines. And this is happening faster than a lot of analysts even projected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Alexa, tell me the news on CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBB: What it means is that we are talking more than we're typing. And if it's the case, then we have a very close and personal relationship with these companies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But how close is too close and who exactly is listening?</p><p>REID: Alexa, stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: What does and doesn't Alexa record?</p><p>REID: Alexa only records after she hears the wake word.</p><p>HARLOW: Who at Amazon hears what I tell Alexa when I'm talking to her?</p><p>REID: A small group of annotators who do some ground truthing. They take very small subsets, it's - it's de-linked from customer data, to help train the models that go back into improving speech technology.</p><p>ANTHONIO PETTIT, WRITER &amp; DATA ACCOUNTABILITY CONSULTANT, ACCOUNTABLE OBJECTIVITY MOVEMENT FOUNDER: There are people on the other end.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: Anthonio Pettit is one of them. During his seven-month contract at Amazon, Pettit analyzed Alexa commands gone wrong, in order to improve the technology. He now works in Artificial Intelligence at Microsoft.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETTIT: Amazon is listening to what you tell Alexa, not in any type of nefarious way, to my knowledge. I believe that everything that they do is based on quality assurance. But people should know that. I think that that is something that is definitely not advertised.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you say to those folks who think \"Oh my Gosh, someone's listening to me?\"</p><p>REID: I think it's important for customers to understand that we're not listening to them. It's a very, very small percentage that is - is carved off for ensuring that the models are doing what the models say that they're supposed to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But if you're one of the estimated 66 million Americans who use a voice assistant speaker, you know that voice technology today is far from perfect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Many people have heard the story of the couple's conversation, they got recorded without them triggering Alexa with the key word, and actually emailed the - to a - to a contact of theirs. How does something like that happen?</p><p>REID: In that particular case, Alexa did what it thought the customer was intending Alexa to do. And, in the end, we still got it wrong. There are defects for us. And we try to learn from those.</p><p>HARLOW: Is there a day that you foresee where you can 100 percent guarantee that won't happen again?</p><p>REID: There's no technology that works a 100 percent of the time. We should strive towards that, which we are.</p><p>[23:35:00] HILL: I think the problem is the law. We have a very weak legal framework around privacy that doesn't give consumers a lot of rights. Unless you're monitoring the traffic, monitoring your network, you can't really know what's happening in the background. You have to trust what the company is telling you it's doing.</p><p>HARLOW: Should people trust that if parts of their conversation are listened to that it won't be used against them in some way that they don't authorize?</p><p>REID: Absolutely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: Next.</p><p>BEZOS: The most important thing that we've done over the last 20 years is earn trust with customers.</p><p>HARLOW: But is that trust in Amazon eroding?</p><p>CICILLINE: I think they have monopoly power.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEZOS: I think the most important thing that we've done over the last 20 years is earn trust with customers.

Amazon does pay state taxes, and it has paid federal taxes in the past, but it's also taken advantage of billions in corporate tax breaks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILKE: We pay all the taxes we're required to pay. We paid $2.6 billion in cash taxes in the last three years. If last year, we paid no tax in the U.S., it was because the law required us to pay no tax. Since 2011, we've invested $200 billion in the U.S. in infrastructure for fulfillment, and delivery, and data centers, and solar farms, and wind farms that these are exactly the kind of investments that the tax code was intended to stimulate. But the result of it is that it's a - that ends up being a deduction that means we didn't pay any tax last year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But it's not just taxes that have critics questioning Amazon's business practices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINA KHAN, ACADEMIC FELLOW AT COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: The Antitrust laws are really focused on promoting competition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: In 2017, Yale Law student, Lina Khan published \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" a paper in the Yale Law Journal that reframed the national conversation on Antitrust law in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KHAN: When you have a situation when a single company is effectively able to set the terms of the marketplace, that's a situation where I think we should worry about the market not being competitive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Critics argue that Amazon's platform has become so dominant anyone looking to sell products online is practically forced to sell there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCHELL: If you want to reach consumers online, and you're not selling through Amazon, you're giving up half the market right out of the gate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Questions have also been raised about the data Amazon collects from all of its marketplace sellers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCHELL: We see Amazon mines their data, watches what they're selling well, and then become a seller in that category itself. It's a very difficult environment in order to succeed in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But Jeff Wilke, the man in charge of the Amazon Marketplace sees it much differently. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILKE: We don't use any data about specific items that's not available to the world by just looking at - at our website.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Which may be true, but Amazon knows how to access and analyze its data better than anyone else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Does Amazon give priority to and prioritize its private label in search?</p><p>WILKE: We prioritize the things that customers want.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: In a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, an Amazon attorney went a step further and categorically denied the claim.</p><p>NATHAN SUTTON, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, LITIGATION &amp; REGULATORY AT AMAZON.COM: We do not use their individual data when we're making decisions to launch private brands. Our incentive is to help the seller succeed because we rely on them.</p><p>HARLOW: Third-party vendors now make up more than half of Amazon's online sellers, helping to fuel its marketplace dominance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILKE: Worldwide retail is something like $30 trillion. We are about 1 percent of that.</p><p>HARLOW: You're about 1 percent of worldwide retail, but you're about 50 percent of U.S. e-commerce.</p><p>WILKE: What's interesting to me is no customer that I've talked to, wakes up in the morning, and says, \"What am I going to buy from e- commerce today?\" and then says, \"What am I going to buy from the store today?\" They say \"What do I need?\" or \"What do I want?\"</p><p>HARLOW: What do you say to folks who say \"Well, I like Amazon. It's super convenient. But it did kill mom-and-pop shops?\"</p><p>WILKE: I - actually I don't think it killed mom-and-pop shops. There's plenty of evidence that there are mom-and-pop shops thriving online and offline too.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But according to a study by the Institute for Local Self- Reliance, 90 percent of more than 850 small businesses surveyed say Amazon has had a negative impact on their revenue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCHELL: We've seen this sharp decline in the number of small businesses across a lot of different industries. We're now creating new businesses at about one-third the rate that we were in the 1980s.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And Washington has started to take notice.

We really want to see the evidence. A lot of people would want to sell what people want, not only Amazon. So, of course, we would like to see well how does this dual relationship work that you're both a host and a competitor? And - and that is the key question here. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: So, if you're Jeff Bezos, how freaked out would you be about European regulators right now?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well I think they are suitably freaked out.</p><p>HARLOW: So, you think that Amazon should be broken up?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh, a 100 percent.</p><p>WILKE: We have intense competition everywhere in the world, in every one of our businesses. So, I - the main question for me is why?</p><p>HARLOW: Is Amazon too big?</p><p>JASSY: I don't think Amazon is too big. And I think if you look at most of the business segments, in which we operate, we are a relatively small percentage of the total market segment.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you make of the calls to break up Amazon?</p><p>DIMON: I think that's a silly idea and concept. Amazon is doing a lot of good things for a lot of people. That's not a problem.

And so, people who engage with Prime video, they convert from free trials to paid membership at a higher rate. They renew their memberships at a higher rate, and they shop more.</p><p>HARLOW: Did you know it was going to work?</p><p>HART: Of course, not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)</p><p>BEZOS: This phone is gorgeous.

So, yes, you learn from that.</p><p>HARLOW: Has he affected the way you run your bank?</p><p>DIMON: Oh, sure. If you made a bunch of products and services, where you click on and then you have to wait a second, and--</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>DIMON: --we didn't really think about it very much until I was reading something about Amazon.

There was that 2015 New York Times article about culture here at Amazon, and employees saying that it can be cutthroat, and that it can be relentless. When you read that what did you think?</p><p>JASSY: I think it was quite skewed.

There's a ripple effect that creates economic opportunity for others.</p><p>HARLOW: Opportunity, however, not shared by all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's greatly impacted the cost of living with rent. Especially. Pushing people out, especially from neighborhoods like this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From a business point of view, I realized the wheels of progress have to keep turning. On the other side, it does not make the people who are being pushed out feel very good about it.</p><p>SCHOLES: Got a big imbalance in Seattle between the number of jobs that we've created and welcomed here and the amount of housing that we built so when you have that imbalance, you're going to get an affordability crisis. We have one today in Seattle.</p><p>HARLOW: Since 2010, the number of homeless in Seattle has increased nearly 34 percent. To address the crisis, the city council proposed a head tax in 2017 that would tax Seattle's biggest companies $275 per employee. But heavy resistance from Amazon and the Seattle business community led that same city council to reverse its decision, ultimately killing the funding measure.</p><p>ANDY JASSY, CEO, AMAZON WEB SERVICES: I would say that, you know, things like the head tax in Seattle I think are super dangerous for cities to implement.</p><p>[00:05:02] HARLOW: They fought it.</p><p>MCGINN: They fought it hard. And they won.</p><p>KSHAMA SAWANT, COUNCILMEMBER, SEATTLE: It is no surprise to me that Amazon bullies its was --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Council member Sawant.</p><p>HARLOW: Kshama Sawant is a city council member and one of the few elected socialists in the country. She was a leading voice in the movement to pass Seattle's minimum wage increase in 2014. And most recently --</p><p>SAWANT: Our modeling to dodge Amazon and other big corporations --</p><p>HARLOW: -- a vocal proponent of the head tax.</p><p>SAWANT: Amazon has got to pay. Amazon has got to pay.</p><p>It's very clear to ordinary people in Seattle that we need a tax on big businesses like Amazon. Big business, big tech, big developers, make all the profits and are making life unlivable for the rest of us in this city.</p><p>HARLOW: Do you think Amazon's done enough to cushion the impact of its growth on home prices in Seattle?</p><p>JEFF WILKE, CEO WORLDWIDE CONSUMER, AMAZON: Well, first of all, our objective was to take care of customers so if we've been successful at that, which means we've needed to hire more employees and build out our headquarters, that's a good thing.</p><p>It's not like we built this headquarters under a shroud and ripped it off and said, you know, ta-da. This was built over years. So, the community had the time with us to, you know, to plan for this growth. I believe that we'll -- the city of Seattle working with us, we'll get this right. We want to be a great corporate citizen.</p><p>HARLOW: In addition to Mary's Place, a permanent homeless shelter set to open inside one of Amazon's new buildings, Amazon announced $8 million more in donations to homeless charities. Still, some say, for one of the richest companies in the world, it needs to do more.</p><p>SAWANT: They are going to do what they want for their bottom line. If you want something that is socially beneficial, we are going to have to fight for it as ordinary people. I mean, look at what happened in New York City.</p><p>HARLOW: In the fall of 2017, Amazon decided it wanted a new place to call home, a second North American headquarters. And in typical Jeff Bezos fashion, they weren't just going to pick a city like most companies. Amazon would hold a year-long competition but the seemingly irresistible prize, Amazon's HQ2 and the potential for 50,000 new jobs.</p><p>FMR. GOV. BRIAN SANDOVAL (R) NEVADA: Much like Amazon, Las Vegas is truly unique.</p><p>HARLOW: After a 14-month search and more than 200 bids from cities across the country --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: New York and Virginia were the big winners of the Amazon HQ2 hunger games.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Eye-popping incentives for Amazon including a helipad at its planned New York location.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But in Queens, New York, the winners high wore off quickly. Days after the announcement, vocal residents, union and community leaders, led protests over the $3 billion tax break for their new neighbor. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're New Yorkers. You can't walk all over us.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Because of the noise from lawmakers, Amazon kind of decided to turn the car around. That it wasn't worth this fight.</p><p>HARLOW: Three months later, Amazon abruptly canceled its plans for New York's HQ2.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We got a call this morning saying we're taking our ball and we're going home. I've never seen anything like it.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I think it's incredible. I mean, it shows that everyday Americans still have the power to organize and fight for their communities.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I think it's a big loss for New York City.</p><p>STELTER: I think if anything, Amazon came away looking even more powerful. They were able to say no to New York City.</p><p>HARLOW: Plus, Amazon wasn't exactly walking away empty handed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They now have access to some --</p><p>HARLOW: All this data.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All this data.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Frisco is prime to have you.</p><p>STACY MITCHELL, CO-DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL SELF-RELIANCE: There are over 200 cities across the country that bid on the HQ2, and they put together these big packages of all of this information. Things like where are future infrastructure investments going to go, what's the distribution of our population that has different kinds of education degrees?</p><p>So now Amazon has this information about all of these different cities and it's going to put that to really prodigious use in the coming years as it thinks about where to put a new warehouse or a new office or a retail store. No one else has that.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I wish them luck. It's going to be a beauty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and the other Washington. DONALD GRAHAM, OWNER &amp; CHAIRMAN, GRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANY: I think ownership of the Post has risks for Amazon as well as benefits.</p><p>[00:10:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: It was 2013 and one of the country's leading newspapers was in serious trouble.</p><p>GRAHAM: The 2008 financial crisis was devastating. We'd been through a lot of recessions, but we'd never seen anything like this.</p><p>The Washington Post had been owned by the Graham family since 1933 but now it was struggling to survive.</p><p>GRAHAM: I was trying to figure out how a newspaper that had been successful in print could be successful in the digital world.</p><p>HARLOW: So, Don Graham, chairman of the Post at the time, talked to everyone he could in Silicon Valley.</p><p>GRAHAM: I talked to Steve Jobs. I talked to Gates. I talked to Mark Zuckerberg. I talked to the founders of Google. I talked to Jeff. Over and over again. I remember that it was smart, sensible, and not full of himself.</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos came with the influential endorsement of Warren Buffet.</p><p>GRAHAM: Warren at that time was on our board. And Warren said Jeff Bezos is the best CEO in the United States.</p><p>HARLOW: Really?</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Graham made an offer and Bezos took it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In a surprise move the Washington Post is being sold to the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON.COM INC.: It is the newspaper in the capital city of the most important country in the world. The Washington Post has an incredibly important role to play in this democracy. I know that when I'm 90, it's going to be one of the things I'm most proud of.</p><p>HARLOW: But skeptics wondered if Bezos had a different strategy at play.</p><p>[00:14:57] SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: I think his intentions are good. Republican billionaires buy football teams. Democratic billionaires buy newspapers.</p><p>But it's also a pretty decent heat shield and prophylactic against antitrust because if a liberal newspaper is not in favor of antitrust against Bezos, it's just a fantastic way to put sheep's clothing around a wolf.</p><p>HARLOW: And over the next five years, Bezos invested even more in the nation's capital, purchasing the largest home in the city, choosing its suburbs for Amazon's second headquarters, and spending more on lobbying than any other tech company so far this year.</p><p>STELTER: Amazon is one of the single most influential companies in Washington.</p><p>HARLOW: Do you think owning the Washington Post has given Bezos more clout among the political class here in Washington?</p><p>GRAHAM: No. As the owner of Amazon, Jeff could hardly have more clout if he wanted to exercise it. But I see no evidence that Jeff is using the Washington Post to advance any political interest.</p><p>HARLOW: And current executives at the Post have stated repeatedly that Bezos is not involved in any editorial decisions.</p><p>Has it ever been a concern for you at all that the interest of Amazon could have motivated the purchase of the Post?</p><p>GRAHAM: I suppose that's possible but I think ownership of the Post has risks for Amazon as well as benefits. The risk is that when the Post writes a negative article about a politician, about a government, it can make people unhappy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think the Washington Post is a Russian asset. It's put there for the benefit, the Washington Post, of Amazon. That's my opinion and I think it's a disgrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: President Trump has made a habit of hurling unsubstantiated allegations at Amazon and Bezos on Twitter, accusing him of lobbying through the Washington Post. Calling the paper fake news and claiming Amazon is scamming the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>What started the beef between President Trump and Jeff Bezos?</p><p>STELTER: I think fundamentally this is about the Washington Post, it's a very influential newspaper. It's a paper that covers Trump very critically, and rightly so. As a result, Trump lashes out.</p><p>GRAHAM: I have seen other presidents do the same thing.</p><p>(BEGIN VOICE CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD NIXON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: From now on, no reporter from the Washington Post is ever to be in the White House. Is that clear?</p><p>(END VOICE CLIP) GRAHAM: There was a man named Richard M. Nixon who was very direct and very personal in what he felt about the Washington Post so President Trump is doing what an awful lot of politicians have done over the years.</p><p>HARLOW: Earlier this year Trump also took aim at Bezos' personal life after the National Enquirer leaked revealing text messages between Bezos and the woman he was seeing just one day after he'd announced his separation from his wife, Mackenzie. President Trump weighed in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I wish him luck. It's going to be a beauty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos wrote in a medium post that he suspected politics might be in play in the Enquirer's reporting.</p><p>STELTER: And he wanted to say so publicly. The Enquirer came to him and said we have all these photos and we could share it unless you stop accusing us of political motivations. So, the magazine wanted to shut Bezos up.</p><p>HARLOW: But instead, Bezos released e-mails from the Enquirer to his team and accused them of blackmail and extortion.</p><p>BRAD STONE, AUTHOR, THE EVERYTHING STORE: I was shocked. I think a lot of people around him were shocked, you know. This is not someone whose personal life had drawn a lot of attention.</p><p>HARLOW: No.</p><p>STONE: And that was a situation that was extraordinary.</p><p>HARLOW: In a statement, the tabloid told CNN, quote, \"The National Enquirer acted lawfully and stands by the accuracy of our reporting.\"</p><p>STELTER: I think to this day it is still a mystery about exactly what happened with the Enquirer.</p><p>HARLOW: Yet the scandal placed Bezos in an entirely new light.</p><p>STONE: I think he thought and probably believed pretty strongly that he was doing the right thing. By confronting this - this abusive media power.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I think it was handled brilliantly. And I think there's a reservoir of goodwill towards Jeff Bezos because he's been seen as a responsible steward of the Washington Post. So, I think his personal reputation has probably never been stronger.</p><p>HARLOW: The medium post I think that surprised everyone with very serious allegations of blackmail. I'm interested if that has affected Amazon at all and if it has changed at all how he leads Amazon. WILKE: It hasn't changed how he leads. Jeff is as engaged as he's been for years. His ideas are just as clever. I've watched him give messages to our teams, and all-hands meetings, and smaller group messages, and the messages are spot-on. They're aligned with our culture and our leadership principles. He's the same Jeff that I've worked alongside for 20 years and I hope he stays the same Jeff.</p><p>[00:10:01] HARLOW: Coming up, the future of Amazon.</p><p>AMY WEBB, AUTHOR, THE BIG NINE: It's plausible that Amazon will pretty soon know you better than your spouse does, better than your kids do, better than you know yourself.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, command start.</p><p>HARLOW: In 2015 --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Engine running.</p><p>HARLOW: -- Jeff Bezos took a giant leap into a new frontier.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And liftoff.</p><p>HARLOW: Jeff Bezos recently said that Blue Origin, his space venture, is the most important thing he's working on. Why?</p><p>STONE: Because I think he thinks of it as a long-term solution for humanity's biggest problems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEZOS: It's time to go back to the moon, this time to stay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Bezos is now spending a billion dollars a year of his own money exploring space. And while his rocket ships don't say Amazon today, that may change sooner than we think.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And liftoff.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Think we'll ever have Amazon fulfillment centers on the moon?</p><p>BEZOS: That's a very good question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Amazon recently won a patent for a floating warehouse that could store drones 45,000 feet into space. One of many strangers than fiction ideas Amazon has in the works. [00:25:02] WEBB: They're deep in research now on recognizing not only who you are but what you are in that moment in time.</p><p>HARLOW: According to Bloomberg, Amazon is working on a wearable device that can read human emotions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Voice profiles give you the ability to teach Alexa your voice.</p><p>WEBB: Using a baseline of your biometrics --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexa, close the shades, please.</p><p>WEBB: You know, are you depressed?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, tell Roomba to start cleaning.</p><p>WEBB: Are you happy?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexa, what time is it?</p><p>WEBB: Are you manic? Have you had a stroke and don't realize it yet? Do you have early onset Parkinson's?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, turn the TV on.</p><p>WEBB: These are all discoverable if there's a big enough database of your voice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, tell my coffee machine to prepare --</p><p>STONE: Health care is clearly in the next big business they want to offer. They acquired this company called Pill Pack which distributes drugs.</p><p>WEBB: It's your medication made easy.</p><p>STONE: They're working on ways to turn Alexa into a doctor in your home.</p><p>WEBB: It's plausible that Amazon or any of the other big tech companies will pretty soon know you better than your spouse does, better than your kids or parents do, better than you know yourself. Or you're willing to admit.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Amazon knows our food intake. It knows our body mass index because of the clothes we're wearing. It knows if we're in a monogamous relationship. It knows how many kids we have.</p><p>HARLOW: The question is, what is Amazon doing with all that information?</p><p>WILKE: When you search for something, artificial intelligence is making the search result better than it used to be. When we show you the list of recommendations that are personalized for you, that result is improved by artificial intelligence. HARLOW: A.I. has also improved Amazon's long-awaited drone delivery system.</p><p>WILKE: You have to be really good at this so that customers can trust it completely. Regulators can trust --</p><p>HARLOW: You have to make the drone even smarter.</p><p>WILKE: Yes. Sixty to 80 percent of the items that we shipped could be shipped by the drones that we're working on.</p><p>HARLOW: But all of that convenience, experts say, could come at exponentially higher cost to our privacy.</p><p>WEBB: In the case, for example, of Amazon, Amazon has incredibly powerful image recognition technology.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People really love this image recognition service.</p><p>WEBB: At the moment, we don't have any caselaw that answers the question, who owns your face?</p><p>HARLOW: Yet, Amazon's facial recognition software is already being used by law enforcement across the country, drawing criticism from the ACLU.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's think about what those powers cold mean in the hands of the government.</p><p>HARLOW: And Amazon's own employees who say the powerful technology must be carefully regulated before it's put to broad use.</p><p>You have been pretty open about the fact that this is a service that could do harm, in your words. There have been concerns about racial and gender discrimination. How do you protect against that?</p><p>JASSY: We give pretty clear guidance to the law enforcement agencies that they should only use the predictions that come back from our facial recognition technology if they have confidence levels of at least 99 percent and then only as one element of a human-driven decision.</p><p>But I also understand why people are concerned and I also think that it's very reasonable for governments to put regulations in place that provide extra guidelines for how the technology should be used.</p><p>HARLOW: But what if the problem is not the user but the artificial intelligence taking over all of big tech and its potential for bias?</p><p>WEBB: Women of color are far more likely to have the secondary screening at an airport than men or Caucasian women because you look like an anomaly to a system that for the most part was built by a whole bunch of people who maybe aren't racist but never occurred to them --</p><p>HARLOW: A whole bunch of white men. WEBB: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: One reason another tech giant, Google, has been hesitant to bring this technology to market so swiftly.</p><p>Google has chosen, at least for now, not to sell facial recognition technologies while your competitors like Amazon are moving full steam ahead.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: We realize there are potential cases in which there isn't a clear regulatory framework around how technology can be used. That gives us pause.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As opposed to some companies who are backing away from supporting the government, we are unwavering in our support to serve government.</p><p>HARLOW: Is it worth to given what Amazon has brought to the world?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, the question is, is Amazon a net good? A 100 percent yes, but the problem is with the word, \"net.\" Fossil fuels are a net positive for society but we still have emission standards. Pesticides are a net positive for us but we still have an FDA.</p><p>Amazon has been a net positive. Does that mean they shouldn't be broken up when they become noncompetitive? No, they should be broken up.</p><p>[00:30:04] WEBB: I would argue that if you force these companies to break apart, you could say that that's a national security issue because, quite frankly, we all rely on these companies. We need Amazon, we need Google, we need Apple, we need Microsoft. So the question is, where do we go from here?</p><p>BEZOS: My view on this is very simple: all big institutions of any kind are going to be, and should be, examined, scrutinized, inspected.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got customers to serve.</p><p>HARLOW: Twenty-five years since the age of Amazon began, Bezos's bookstore is an American institution. And scrutiny is exactly what it's getting.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-RI: So you're telling us here, under oath, that Amazon doesn't use any of that data to favor Amazon products.</p><p>HARLOW: From its ever-expanding size to its impact on the planet. Yet nothing is slowing Amazon down.</p><p>(on camera) Is it unparalleled?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: There's only a handful of so many things that have grown like this, and been in so many businesses, and invented so many things, and invented their own technolopgy to accomplish what they want to do. It's still a growing machine. WEBB: Jeff Bezos is a visionary. And you can question whether or not every decision being made is in the right one for what's in the best interest of humanty, but I cannot think of very many other people alive or in recent history that are as capable or as gifted in long- range thinking as Bezos is.</p><p>BEZOS: We're now big enough to hurt this planet. We have to use the resources of space. When that is possible, when the infrastructure is in place, just as it was for me in 1994 to start Amazon, you will see amazing things happen. And it will happen very fast. I guarantee it.</p><p>[00:30:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019083001CNV67</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WY1-9391-JB20-G1HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 30, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0003SRP</classCode><className>MITCHELL CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL SELF-RELIANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>SIC2431 MILLWORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Then we build your custom home inside it, doing all kinds of things for the bedroom, the bathroom, the kitchen. ...</p><p>Most every Advanced RV coach has a refrigerator/freezer, microwave, kitchen counter and sink, induction cooktop, shower, toilet, bathroom sink, heat, hot water, insulated plumbing, queen-plus beds. ... We have built-in child beds and bunk beds and installed sound systems. We upgrade sound and thermal insulation. We upgrade suspensions. We include powered vents, air conditioning, skylights, sun roofs and solar power.</p><p>We have created different spaces for dogs and cats. We did one for a parrot with separate heating, cage suspension, lighting and ventilation.</p><p>We specialize in Mercedes-Benz Sprinter motor homes. We mainly do 19-footers and 24-footers. They\u2019re mostly for travelers, but we do some retail ones, too. We did a mobile dental office. We did a high-end retail truck for a local family business.</p><p>We also build rugged, off-road, 4x4 models with inside and top room for bikes and gear.</p><p>Who can afford them?</p><p>Our clients are the most engaged people you could imagine. They\u2019re from almost every state. One\u2019s the former head of R&amp;D at a big tech company. Then there\u2019s a doctor at a local hospital. She calls her RV her woman cave. She drives it to work. She goes out there to make a nice lunch and listen to classical music. She goes back to work refreshed.</p><p>We have several single women who don\u2019t have another house. They live in these and travel in them. But most customers are couples and split the driving.</p><p>The clients are a community. There\u2019s a Facebook group. They meet. Every year, we have an open house. Last year, we had 25, 30 clients come back with their RVs.</p><p>Is it hard to drive an RV?</p><p>It\u2019s actually easier than most vehicles. You sit high and have great visibility, with 360-degree cameras.</p><p>The client usually spends a day or two here in orientation. But we have delivered a couple of homes and trained customers there. It\u2019s mostly for how all the systems work.</p><p>What sort of mileage does a typical home get?</p><p>About 18 miles per gallon.</p><p>How many RVs do you turn out per year?</p><p>About 24 complete custom builds and 100 upgrades. We opened in 2012, and we\u2019re growing well. Our big constraint now is getting enough chassis. We have about a year\u2019s backlog from current deposits.</p><p>Who works here?</p><p>About 35 people. I hired the best craftspeople in everything from upholstery to cabinet making to sound systems to plumbing. Cleveland has great skills.</p><p>Do you service what you sell?</p><p>We have 24/7 tech support. Whether it\u2019s a Mercedes problem or ours, we help them find the best service close to them to get them back on the road the quickest.</p><p>What did you do before RVs?</p><p>As a kid, I worked at the [Holden] Arboretum. After college, I spent about six months with Aetna as an inspector. I decided I didn\u2019t do well with big companies.</p><p>I started a pollution-abatement business in the early \u201970s, Neundorfer Inc. We employed about 50 people. We worked for heavy industries: paper, cement, steel. ... In many cases, we could reduce emissions by 50% and save energy. It\u2019s just a matter of making it affordable.</p><p>Clients back then?</p><p>FirstEnergy, U.S. Steel ...</p><p>Do local industries try to help the planet?</p><p>When regulations have been relaxed, businesses have slacked off. We all need discipline and guidelines to do the right thing at times, especially where there\u2019s a lot of pressure for shareholder returns. But longer term, the investment in reducing pollution and energy pays off.</p><p>I sold the business five years ago to Steve Ostanek, my No. 2 guy, who\u2019d been with me 35 years.</p><p>How did you get into RVs?</p><p>[Wife] Marcia and I have always been privileged to be able to travel. We hitchhiked, bicycled, backpacked, bummed around Europe. After 9/11, we decided to explore North America a little more. We rented a small motor home. It broke down. So we bought a Sprinter.</p><p>Early in business, I learned how to fly and flew a lot of places, mostly out of the Cuyahoga County Airport. But it took too much practice and time. So I used the Sprinter for business. The last one, I couldn\u2019t get what I wanted. So I thought people might be interested in a totally custom motor home.</p><p>How did you get started?</p><p>We had to build one. It took about a year. I didn\u2019t sleep a whole night that year. We got designated a master outfitter by Mercedes-Benz. We started small and built some and sold some. Still, one of my dreams every night is about a problem here.</p><p>When not working or worrying about work, where do you hang out?</p><p>I\u2019m trying to do that hill behind Squire\u2019s Castle once a day. We go to Holden [Arboretum], Chapin Forest, the [Cuyahoga Valley] National Park, the bike trail in Chardon.</p><p>For almost 40 years, our date weekly has been to go to the West Side Market. We love Frank\u2019s Bratwurst. But something has to be done. There\u2019s too many empty booths.</p><p>My brother Paul and his husband, Jack Mueller, own Felice. We love the food.</p><p>We get to downtown Willoughby a lot. There are probably a dozen good restaurants.</p><p>With all the places you\u2019ve traveled to, how does Cleveland stack up?</p><p>It\u2019s a big city with a small-town feel. It\u2019s gritty. It\u2019s Midwestern honest. It\u2019s interesting old architecture. The ethnic mix is wonderful.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else, with all the connections we have through our kids and ice hockey and schools. I was one of seven kids. Just about anyplace we go, there\u2019s somebody we know.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Grant Segall | The Plain Dealer Mike Neundorfer\u2019s Advanced RV in Willoughby customizes Mercedes-Benz Sprinter mobile homes for around $250,000 apiece.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLEVPD-MERLIN_85403530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLEVPD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTX-X501-JCTS-G1GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

For instance, those who called for a high level of data protection in Europe, while simultaneously arguing that the Regulation should be replaced by a Directive. (\u2026) We have listened to these arguments for two years. Round and round in circles while, every day, the headlines have reminded us of why the reform is important.</p><p>Discussions are mature. The text is ready. It is just a matter of political will.</p><p>Europe needs a data protection compact (see IP/14/70 ):</p><p>We should all draw lessons from these examples and our recent experiences. Here are mine: eight principles that should govern the way data is processed by the public and the private sector. They form a Data Protection Compact for Europe.</p><p>[The data protection compact] would enable us Europeans to exercise our right of digital self-determination. Not to depend on decisions made elsewhere, but to decide ourselves how we want to protect the personal data of our citizens; while keeping our internal market open and competitive.</p><p>SPEECH:</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Two years ago, on 25 January 2012, a great debate began in Europe. A debate about data protection in a world of total connectivity. About privacy in a world where data flows across borders as easily as the air we breathe. About the future of the digital economy.</p><p>9 months ago, the debate took an unexpected turn. The first stories about PRISM were published. Since then, headlines have been dominated by stories about government surveillance. In my dialogues with citizens across the Union, the sense of shock was palpable. We have learned that the times of mass surveillance are not relegated to the past.</p><p>Data collection by companies and surveillance by governments. These issues are connected, not separate. The surveillance revelations involve companies whose services we all use on a daily basis. Backdoors have been built, encryption has been weakened. Concerns about government surveillance drive consumers away from digital services. From a citizen's perspective, the underlying issue is the same in both cases. Data should not be kept simply because storage is cheap. Data should not be processed simply because algorithms are refined. Safeguards should apply and citizens should have rights.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Trust in the data driven economy, already worryingly low, fell further when the first NSA slides were published. The priority should be to restore it. Today I will speak about how this can be done.</p><p>    First, I will outline what concrete steps need to be taken to restore trust in personal data processing by companies and Governments;</p><p>    Second, I will tell you where Europe stands in this debate;</p><p>    Third, I will take a broader view and argue that we need a data protection compact for Europe.</p><p>I. Rebuilding trust in data processing</p><p>The surveillance scandals have been a wake-up call, and Europe is responding.</p><p>A. Rebuilding trust in EU-U.S. data flows</p><p>The Commission took a firm stance from the first surveillance revelations, saying loud and clear that mass surveillance is unacceptable. We set out the steps that should be taken to rebuild trust in EU-U.S. data flows. Three steps are of particular importance.</p><p>First, we must make Safe Harbour safer. The Commission has made 13 concrete recommendations. 13 ways to improve all aspects of the functioning of Safe Harbour. Let me put it simply: we kicked the tyres and saw that repairs are needed. For Safe Harbour to be fully roadworthy the U.S. will have to service it. This summer, we will see how well those repairs were carried out. Safe Harbour has to be strengthened or it will be suspended.</p><p>Secondly, we have to agree on strong data protection rules in the law enforcement context. We need a robust EU-U.S. data protection agreement in the law enforcement sector (the so-called Umbrella Agreement) which ensures EU citizens keep their rights when their data is processed in the U.S. This is not theory. What if your name is identical to that of a suspect in a transatlantic criminal investigation? Your data accidentally gets collected and included on a U.S. black list. You should be able to have it deleted by the authorities \u2013 if necessary by a judge \u2013 once the mistake is discovered. Europeans (and Americans) have those rights in the EU. They should have them when their data is exchanged with the U.S.</p><p>Thirdly, we must ensure that European concerns are addressed in the reform of U.S. surveillance programmes. President Obama's speech just 10 days ago is a step in the right direction. He recognised that the current data collection programmes go too far. New limits on bulk data collection will be imposed. He also responded to a long-standing request from the European Commission, namely to give European citizens who do not live in the U.S. rights and protection when their data is being processed across the Atlantic. In his Presidential Policy Directive, President Obama gave clear instructions for current safeguards that apply to U.S. citizens \u2013 such as the principle of data minimisation and retention \u2013 to in future be available to \"all persons, regardless of their nationality or wherever they might reside\".</p><p>It is a window of opportunity for restricting the powers of intelligence services and completing the negotiations on the long overdue Umbrella Agreement. We need to turn opportunities into enforceable rights.</p><p>I have spoken to the U.S. Secretary of Justice Eric Holder and to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker, to underline that for us Europeans, it is essential these announcements are followed up by legislative action before the summer.</p><p>Trust in the transatlantic relationship is being rebuilt. European concerns are being taken into account in the U.S. reform. This is the right way forward. We need to keep up the pace and we need to keep talking to each other. This is what partners do: not spying on each other, but talking to each other.</p><p>B. Rebuilding trust in the digital economy</p><p>Restoring trust in the transatlantic relations is not the only area where action is needed. Because trust in the way private enterprises process data is low too. 92% of Europeans are concerned about mobile apps collecting their data without their consent. 89% of people say they want to know when the data on their smartphone is being shared with a third party.</p><p>Why are the figures so poor?</p><p>Because citizens know that companies use their personal data in ways that they cannot control or influence.</p><p>Some say that this is a question of individuals\u2019 knowledge being overtaken by technological change. But what does a citizen do when he or she understands, disagrees even, but cannot act? Let\u2019s take a simple example. What happens when a citizen wants to play a game on a tablet. He or she has to pay for the app, but doesn\u2019t want personal data, for instance location data, to be collected. He or she might also be spied upon. Now I know why the 'Angry Birds' look so angry. Often with applications, the rule is \u2018take it or leave it\u2019. That\u2019s when trust evaporates. That's when people feel forced to part with their privacy.</p><p>I believe that this is a question of individuals\u2019 rights being overridden by technological change. That\u2019s why it is important to put individuals back in control by updating their rights. Explicit consent, the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability and the right to be informed of personal data breaches are important elements. They will help close the growing rift between citizens and the companies with which they share their data, willingly or otherwise.</p><p>And people should see that their rights are enforced in a meaningful way. Take the change to Google's privacy policy decided in March 2012. Several national data protection authorities in the EU found that this does not comply with existing data protection rules. Google has been sanctioned in two countries, France and Spain, and is under investigation in four other countries, including Germany. In Spain, Google was fined the maximum amount of EUR 900,000, while in France, whose data protection authority is one of the most feared in Europe, the fine levied was EUR 150 000, also the highest possible sum. Taking Google's 2012 performance figures, the fine in France represents 0.0003% of its global turnover. For them, this looks more like pocket money than a fine.</p><p>Is it surprising to anyone that two whole years after the case emerged, it is still unclear whether Google will amend its privacy policy or not?</p><p>We need to get serious. And that is why our reform introduces stiff sanctions that can reach as much as 2% of global annual turnover of a company. In the Google case, that would have meant a fine of EUR 731 million (USD 1 billion).</p><p>We need a law that no-one can ignore. Rules that not only bark but bite! Showing citizens that a strong EU data protection framework effectively protects and upholds their rights will help to rebuild trust.</p><p>My message is simple. Let\u2019s believe in granting people meaningful rights. The European Union and its Member States are founded on the rights of citizens. It is by recognising the rights of individuals that European societies are considered amongst the most decent in human history. Let\u2019s act to make sure that our principles apply online as well as offline. Let\u2019s give citizens control over their data.</p><p>This is why the Data Protection Reform proposals are central to our efforts to restore trust in the digital economy. They are the answer to citizens\u2019 fears that nothing can be done, a reassertion of citizens\u2019 rights over their own data.</p><p>II. Current state of data protection in the EU</p><p>A. The state of play of the data protection reform</p><p>The European Parliament understood. On 21 October 2013, the LIBE Committee voted overwhelmingly in favour of the reform. The Parliament realised the issue was bigger than the distinction between left and right. Political groups from the EPP to the S&amp;D via the Liberals and the Greens agreed on a single text. The European Parliament wants a strong Regulation, with strong sanctions to ensure that it is respected.</p><p>A few days later, when our Heads of State and Government were asked the same question, some wanted to be ambitious. President Hollande, Prime Minister Letta, Prime Minister Tusk supported President Barroso. Unfortunately, others blinked. It seems that some chose to pay more attention to the spin of lobbyists than to the concerns of Europe\u2019s citizens. The result: since, the European Council acts by consensus, the digital economy summit was inconclusive. European leaders could only agree to complete the data protection reform in a \"timely\" manner, and at the latest by the end of 2014.</p><p>This is a lowest and slowest common denominator approach! Such an approach is particularly inappropriate in the field of data protection. It is inappropriate as our citizens expect ambition and speedy progress when it comes to the protection of their personal data. And it is also procedurally inappropriate as, in the field of data protection, Europe does not decide by unanimity, but by qualified majority in the Council of Ministers, in co-decision with the European Parliament. It is thus high time to move away from the lowest and slowest common denominator towards high standards, a high level of protection of personal data, and a speedy completion of the work of the co-legislators.</p><p>It is true that some companies and a few governments continue to see data protection as an obstacle rather than as a solution; privacy rights as compliance costs, and not as an asset. Yet data protection goes right to the core of our daily lives. It's about making sure that the people operating your smartphone don\u2019t know more about your life than your family does. It's about your insurance policy not going up every time you type the name of an illness into a search engine. It's about your teenage profile not being looked at forever.</p><p>There has been a lot of hypocrisy in the debate. There were those who called for a high level of data protection in Europe, while simultaneously arguing that the Regulation should be replaced by a Directive. A Directive would mean the status quo. It would mean 28 Member States doing what they want. It would mean data protection on paper but not in practice.</p><p>We have listened to these arguments for two years. Round and round in circles while, every day, the headlines have reminded us of why the reform is important. Waiting patiently \u2013 or maybe not so patiently \u2013 as Big Data has been generated against the will of the people.</p><p>And yet in practice where do we stand? Discussions are mature. The text is ready. It is just a matter of political will.</p><p>B. Member State and EU law</p><p>If the EU wants to be credible in its efforts to rebuild trust, if it wants to act as an example for other continents, it also has to get its own house in order. Let me give you three examples.</p><p>First example: the TEMPORA programme in the UK</p><p>It has been reported that under the TEMPORA programme, GCHQ \u2013 the UK signal intelligence centre \u2013 intercepts and stores data from fibre-optic cables that transmit data across the Atlantic and to Western Europe. If so, the data of UK and other EU citizens is collected, on an enormous scale, every day. Traffic data, recordings of phone calls, the content of email messages, entries on Facebook.</p><p>When the reports about TEMPORA emerged, the European Commission wrote to the UK Government expressing its concerns and asking questions about the nature and the scope of the programme. The response was short: hands off, this is national security.</p><p>Where there is no link to EU law, national security is an area of Member State competence. The hands of the Commission are tied. But let me be clear. If I come across a single email, a single piece of evidence that the TEMPORA programme is not used purely for national security purposes, I will launch infringement proceedings. The mass collection of personal data is unacceptable.</p><p>I see with some satisfaction that the legality of TEMPORA and its compliance with the fundamental right to privacy is currently being analysed by the European Court of Human Rights, following legal challenges from numerous citizens, notably from the UK. I have full confidence in the Court in Strasbourg to listen to these citizens from the UK and their concerns. And to uphold their right to privacy against mass surveillance without limitations.</p><p>Second example: the independence of Germany's Federal Data Protection Authority</p><p>The existence of strong independent supervisory authorities is essential in securing the rights and protection of data subjects. Yet in some Member States, data protection authorities are not sufficiently independent.</p><p>Take the case of Germany\u2019s Federal Data Protection Authority. The federal data protection Commissioner carries out his duties under the supervision of the Minister of the Interior. This is set out by German law. It means that the Minister can take disciplinary measures against the data protection commissioner. In the event of a dispute, the decision of the Minister will prevail. Is effective supervision really possible under these circumstances?</p><p>The new German Government believes in data protection. I trust that it will correct this situation. Just as it has been corrected in the case of the German L\u00e4nder and their data protection authorities.</p><p>Third example: the EU's Data Retention Directive</p><p>I have spoken about the Member States. The EU itself should also look carefully at some of its laws. Neither the Commission, the Council, nor the European Parliament can be proud of the Data Retention Directive.</p><p>The Directive requires telecom companies to store all telephony metadata. This includes geo-location data. The Directive went from proposal to statute book in 6 months. The Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice has recently said out-loud what many of us have been thinking. The data is kept for too long, it is too easily accessed and the risk of abuse is too great. It takes the spirit of the 9/11 aftermath too far. The Advocate-General does not say that data does not need to be retained. He says that greater safeguards need to apply. The Opinion contains a recipe for all those who want the Data Retention Directive to strike the right balance between rights and security.</p><p>One cannot simply use \"national security\" as a trump card and disregard citizens' rights. That is what others used to do. The European Data Retention law needs a health check. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the medicine.</p><p>III. A data protection compact for Europe</p><p>We should all draw lessons from these examples and our recent experiences. Here are mine: eight principles that should govern the way data is processed by the public and the private sector. They form a Data Protection Compact for Europe.</p><p>First of all, we need the data protection reform in the statute book. I wish to see full speed on data protection in 2014. Europe must act decisively to establish a robust data protection framework that can be the gold standard for the world. Otherwise others will move first and impose their standards on us.</p><p>Second, the reform should not distinguish between the private and the public sector. The 1995 directive deals with both. Introducing a distinction today, when citizens are more concerned about processing by the public sector, would not be acceptable. The same principles should apply to both. Citizens would simply not understand a split in times when the public sector collects, collates and sometimes even wants to sell private data. It is also a very difficult distinction to draw when a local authority can buy storage space on a private cloud.</p><p>Third, laws setting out data protection rules or affecting privacy require public debate because they relate to civil liberties online. Take the Polish experience with ACTA and data protection reform. ACTA was not explained. It led to the biggest protests since the fall of Communism and the shock-waves reverberated throughout the European Parliament. The lesson was learnt by the Polish Government. Data protection was the subject of a public information campaign. It led to a joint position paper by the private employers association and the leading civil liberties NGO.</p><p>My fourth principle relates to surveillance. Data collection should be targeted and be limited to what is proportionate to the objectives that have been set. If this element of proportionality is lost, citizens' acceptance will be lost as well. Blanket surveillance of electronic communications data is not acceptable. It amounts to arbitrary interference with the private lives of citizens. We can't treat all citizens like suspects. In the past you couldn't sit in someone's basement and read their letters. Today you shouldn't sit in an office and trawl through their emails.</p><p>Fifth, laws need to be clear and laws need to be kept up to date. I was struck by the reaction of the author of the U.S. Patriot Act, Jim Sensenbrenner to the NSA revelations: \"This is not what the Patriot Act was meant to do!\". Technological change allowed the Patriot Act to be applied in ways that had not been imagined at the time it was written. I draw an important principle from this: It cannot be that States rely on outdated rules, drafted in a different technological age, to frame modern surveillance programmes. Such laws give citizens little or no idea about what is actually going on.</p><p>Sixth, national security should be invoked sparingly. It should be the exception, rather than the rule. The need to protect national security can justify special rules. But not everything that relates to foreign relations is a matter of national security. I believe that it is dangerous to invoke national security where it is not really at stake. It undermines the legitimacy of laws that are vital for our security.</p><p>Seventh, without a role for judicial authorities, there can be no real oversight. Executive oversight is good. Parliamentary oversight is necessary. Judicial oversight is key. Ultimately, whether processing is legitimate is a question of balance between different imperatives, the need to protect privacy and the importance of maintaining security. The judiciary is necessary to ensure that the pendulum does not swing too far.</p><p>And finally a message to our American friends. Data Protection rules should apply irrespective of the nationality of the person concerned. Applying different standards to nationals and non-nationals makes no sense in view of the open nature of the internet. Ultimately, distinguishing between the rights of individuals depending on their nationality and place of residence impedes the free flow of data. Europe should be very proud of the fact that it treats data protection as a fundamental right \u2013 a fundamental right on which every human-being can rely. Companies have understood this \u2013 a big tech giant has just announced it will give its users the option of storing their data in Europe, where it's safe. I hope many other companies will take similar initiatives in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Conclusion: data protection and an open internet</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>The principles I have set out would restore trust in the way in which companies and governments process data. Citizens would benefit because offline rights would apply online. The digital economy would benefit because its growth would be sustainable. National security would benefit because the laws which help secure it would be more legitimate.</p><p>The internet would also benefit. Citizens have been destabilised by what they have learned over the past months. If trust is not restored, they will want their data to remain within borders. It is in the interest of a free internet and of an open internet that we apply these principles and that we empower citizens. That we give our citizens the rights that they deserve.</p><p>Last but not least, Europe would benefit. The recent revelations have shown: at the moment, national governments in Europe are unable to guarantee citizens' personal data is well protected. The Data Protection Compact would change this. It would enable us Europeans to exercise our right of digital self-determination. Not to depend on decisions made elsewhere, but to decide ourselves how we want to protect the personal data of our citizens; while keeping our internal market open and competitive. This is, after all, what Europe is all about. Europe is there to ensure that the rights and interests of our citizens are well protected. And, on that basis, to agree on terms with our partners in the world. Alongside the European Parliament and the majority of governments in Europe, I will continue fighting for this. Because our citizens deserve nothing less. <br/></p><p>For more information please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu\">http://europa.eu</url>/   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-EUN701206</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BD2-HHW1-J9XT-P0B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 29, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But naturally, geography is just one aspect.</p><p>Brexit is the symptom of a development that has been keeping us busy in the EU \u2013 but also much further afield \u2013 for the past few years.</p><p>You all know the keywords:</p><p>The changing geopolitical situation, with a Russia that is taking a new stance, an increasingly dominant China, and not least, regrettably, a US Administration that can be unpredictable at times. Furthermore, there have been internal challenges in Europe in recent years \u2013 the economic and financial crisis and disagreements on migration and the rule of law.</p><p>As Liz Mohn already said, all this has boosted nationalists and populists not only in the UK, but all over Europe. These are the people who want to convince us that there are simple national solutions to the very complex problems we face today.</p><p>However, the huge global challenges \u2013 climate change, migration, globalisation, digital transformation and incidentally epidemics like the coronavirus \u2013 all have one thing in common. They know no national borders.</p><p>And that\u2019s why retreating into national shells is not the answer. What we need, especially now, is more international cooperation, not less.</p><p>As we should not forget on a day like this, that also applies to the current developments at the Greek\u2011Turkish border. Our first aim should be to support Greece in this difficult situation, as the Commission rightfully announced at the weekend.</p><p>With regard to Turkey, we are making clear that we see the burden it is carrying as a result of accommodating what now amount to almost four million refugees. But in a situation like this, we\u2019re not the only ones who must comply with the obligations arising from the relevant agreement. We must also remind the Turkish side to meet its obligations, including and particularly now.</p><p>The EU remains willing to play its part in providing humane care for refugees in Idlib, but also in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Our stance here must be absolutely clear. We cannot allow refugees to become geopolitical pawns. Anyone who attempts this should always expect pushback from our side.</p><p>However, ladies and gentlemen, crises are only one side of the coin.</p><p>All current surveys show that the public\u2019s trust in the European Union has risen again, despite many difficulties and the news confronting us every day.</p><p>We are living in an era in which we only ever talk about how everything is getting worse. I recall a day last year, namely 9 November, when I invited all my EU counterparts to Berlin to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ekaterina was also one of my guests. And when I told her that I was glad she was there, she replied that there was no question of her not attending because the fall of the Wall had paved the way for her personal freedom today.</p><p>And yes, many things changed for the better in these 30 years. There is no longer an Iron Curtain. The EU has become larger. Sometimes we complain about it being difficult to reach agreement among 27 member states. In some cases, this is a relatively complicated matter. At times, it can be gruelling. But the mere fact that the EU is so large shows how far we have come.</p><p>In the final analysis, I believe that Europe is one thing above all, namely humankind\u2019s greatest peace project. And this also holds true at a time when other issues may be dominating public debate.</p><p>As someone who was born in 1966 and grew up in West Germany, let me say that everything that makes my life worth living \u2013 peace, freedom, the rule of law, relative prosperity \u2013 already existed. I didn\u2019t have to fight for any of this. But there are generations who experienced the complete opposite. And that\u2019s why I sometimes think it\u2019s a bit like taking the easy way out when we \u2013 I\u2019m speaking for my own generation now, but this also goes for others \u2013 simply take all the things that make our lives worth living for granted.</p><p>With regard to Europe and the world, we need to realise that the time for taking things for granted is over. We live in an era in which we not only need to put our freedoms and rights into practice, but also to do more to defend them.</p><p>And I see it as a good sign that voter turnout for last year\u2019s European Parliament elections was higher than at any other time in the previous 20 years. It is ultimately our responsibility as politicians to live up to this and to ensure that trust is preserved.</p><p>We want to continue fostering this interest in the EU. And the best way to do this is to actively involve you as EU citizens in debate on European issues both great and small. Which is why it is eminently sensible that President Macron and the heads of the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have made this project a priority.</p><p>And so we have invited 75 members of the public from Poland, France and Germany to a workshop on Europe here in Berlin.</p><p>I\u2019m very happy to see so many of you here. I\u2019m also very pleased that so many members of parliament took part, experts from Brussels, Strasbourg and the large number of European countries represented here today, whose ideas will certainly enrich our discussion. A very warm welcome to the Federal Foreign Office! It\u2019s great that you\u2019re here!</p><p>And a big thank\u2011you to the Mohn family, who support this through the Bertelsmann Stiftung.</p><p>Liz Mohn,</p><p>I listened very closely to your speech just now, especially when you mentioned that Bertelsmann is happy that people are reading more again and want to hold a book in their hands. I have two sons aged 18 and 14 and I haven\u2019t quite got that message through to them yet. Maybe you can help me out and we can try to persuade the two of them that it really can be a nice feeling to hold a book in your hands and to have to turn the pages over instead of simply swiping a screen.</p><p>So this is a welcome development. In my opinion, books and the feeling of being engrossed in them are still very, very valuable. Reading widens our horizons and encourages people to take a look at themselves and their surroundings. I would be absolutely delighted if this trend grew again in our society.</p><p>I heard that there were very lively and also very contentious discussions in the workshop both yesterday and today. And I\u2019m very eager to find out more shortly about what you expect of the Europe of the future.</p><p>I would like to mention just three terms that currently define our discussions in Brussels and the talks with my European counterparts.</p><p>Ms Mohn already mentioned the first one, namely sovereignty. However, people understand this word in many different ways.</p><p>Some people see it as isolationism from the rest of the world. But we see it completely the other way round!</p><p>European sovereignty must always mean having a say and ensuring that Europe is heard in a world of increasing great\u2011power rivalry.</p><p>At the Foreign Affairs Council, we regularly experience how individual countries hold up the decision\u2011making by the other 26 members.</p><p>We think this has to stop. For that reason, we are talking with High Representative Josep Borrell about how we can gradually overcome this way of conducting politics of the lowest common denominator.</p><p>But to my mind, it is even more important that we Europeans do not allow ourselves to be divided or overruled by countries such as China or Russia or for that matter, as is unfortunately the case these days, in trade issues by the US.</p><p>That is exactly what we hope to help achieve during our EU Presidency in the second half of the year, for example by holding an EU\u2011China summit and adopting a clear and agreed stance in our dealings with Moscow or Washington.</p><p>Something else is becoming very clear as regards China and the US, namely that sovereignty can no longer be defined purely in terms of foreign or security policy.</p><p>In the digital age, Europe also needs digital sovereignty. And this challenge affects us all.</p><p>In conjunction with 5G transmission power, artificial intelligence will create profound economic, social and personal change in our lives, ranging from the way we travel to daily life, such as shopping or consulting a doctor.</p><p>But algorithms can only be as intelligent as the data fed into them. This means that machines will only learn the values that are particularly dear to us Europeans if we teach them these values.</p><p>To achieve this, we need technological progress and skills. And if we\u2019re honest, Europe isn\u2019t really up to speed in that regard.</p><p>We currently face the threat of the digital world splitting into two parts.</p><p>On the one hand, we have Silicon Valley, which focuses more on the tech giants\u2019 profits than on our values. And on the other, we have the Chinese model, which is becoming ever more important and powerful, but is also highly repressive and uses digital technology to monitor its own people.</p><p>I don\u2019t think either model is ideal. Europe would be well advised to pursue its own third way here.</p><p>Now in particular, when populists and extremists are attacking our democracy, we cannot allow control over technology or how we deal with criminal online content to lie solely with the big tech firms or foreign governments.</p><p>That\u2019s why we want to do our utmost to support the Commission in launching important parts of its digital strategy during our EU Presidency in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s also why we want to ensure that technology, research and digital transformation are prioritised over other earlier key issues in the multiannual financial framework that is currently the topic of so much debate. There will also be disagreements about this, but we cannot avoid them.</p><p>In the final analysis, something very different is at stake. We want to transfer our European values to the digital age. And to be honest, when I look at the world, I ask myself who else will do this if we don\u2019t.</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation, which was so controversial at first, has now actually become a role model for many people in the world. And when it comes to digital transformation, Europe can show that it is possible both to protect civic rights and to make sovereign decisions as a tech leader.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,</p><p>This interpretation of sovereignty is closely linked to the second term we are discussing in Europe, namely the ability to act.</p><p>At the Munich Security Conference two weeks ago, everyone was talking about \u201cwestlessness\u201d, the West\u2019s apparent retreat from a leadership role in the world. And although I don\u2019t agree with dividing the world up into East, West, North or South, there is a dangerous gap in our neighbourhood in particular in this regard.</p><p>We just need to think about the conflicts surrounding our continent in Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, Libya and the Sahel. The US is increasingly withdrawing from its former role as global policeman and thus becoming less active in the world. And others are taking advantage of that, Russia, for example, or Turkey and Iran \u2013 none of which always share our values or interests.</p><p>And what about Europe?</p><p>In my opinion, we Europeans cannot stand by and watch this development. Too much is at stake.</p><p>Our own stability and security depend on our neighbours\u2019 stability \u2013 and our neighbourhood may be larger than some people believed in the past. That\u2019s why it is right that the new Commission wants to be a \u201cgeopolitical Commission\u201d.</p><p>Libya will be the first litmus test. After months of groundwork, Europeans are finally singing from the same song sheet. Unfortunately, this was not the case in the past. Here in Berlin and at a Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting in Munich, we succeeded in paving the way towards a peace process that has already been far too long in the making. And naturally, Europe must also be willing to continue supporting this process, for example by monitoring the arms embargo now endorsed by parties that permanently violated it in recent weeks.</p><p>As in many other fields, the prerequisite is a clear political strategy, without which any military action will remain ineffective. Europe will only be able to act if we make use of all the instruments in our foreign policy toolbox \u2013 from crisis prevention, arms control and humanitarian assistance to stabilisation, training and the deployment of security forces. And we will also play a part here during our EU Presidency, for example by opening a European centre of excellence for civilian crisis management here in Berlin, where we will work with our European partner countries to ensure that we do not only show up when the shooting has already started.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The third and last term I would like to mention for discussion is \u201cvalues\u201d.</p><p>And when I talk about European values, I would like to start by saying today, the day when talks on our future relationship with the UK begin in Brussels, that the UK has left the EU, but we still share the same values.</p><p>So it\u2019s right that we offer the British the closest possible partnership:</p><p>a free trade area without customs and close cooperation on foreign policy and security issues</p><p>But the prerequisite for this is that the UK does not circumvent European standards or weaken EU structures. We certainly will not engage in a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards or the rights of employees and consumers.</p><p>And there is another important point. When we talk about European values, we need to ensure that these values are not gradually eroded.</p><p>To that end, one very concrete objective of our Presidency is to get together for the first time to talk about how the rule of law is faring in each of our countries, but without pointing the finger at one another.</p><p>If there are shortcomings in Poland or Hungary \u2013 and there are particular processes for that \u2013 this is something we need to discuss. But there is no point simply criticising others the whole time. That will only achieve one thing, namely that governments will shut themselves off and Europe will become more divided.</p><p>Instead, our aim must be to support one another in order to resolve shortcomings and prevent them from arising in the future. And that is what we want to do in cooperation with the EU member states.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>At the end of the day, freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights are what define the EU. They are what keep us together. That is the actual centre of the EU, regardless of where its geographical centre may be. And this must never change.</p><p>As long as we take this to heart, I will not fear for the future of the EU. I look forward to having the chance to discuss all this with you now.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3051930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-6D71-F0YC-N0D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And that's why I sometimes think it's a bit like taking the easy way out when we I'm speaking for my own generation now, but this also goes for others simply take all the things that make our lives worth living for granted.</p><p>With regard to Europe and the world, we need to realise that the time for taking things for granted is over. We live in an era in which we not only need to put our freedoms and rights into practice, but also to do more to defend them.</p><p>And I see it as a good sign that voter turnout for last year's European Parliament elections was higher than at any other time in the previous 20 years. It is ultimately our responsibility as politicians to live up to this and to ensure that trust is preserved.</p><p>We want to continue fostering this interest in the EU. And the best way to do this is to actively involve you as EU citizens in debate on European issues both great and small. Which is why it is eminently sensible that President Macron and the heads of the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have made this project a priority.</p><p>And so we have invited 75 members of the public from Poland, France and Germany to a workshop on Europe here in Berlin.</p><p>I'm very happy to see so many of you here. I'm also very pleased that so many members of parliament took part, experts from Brussels, Strasbourg and the large number of European countries represented here today, whose ideas will certainly enrich our discussion. A very warm welcome to the Federal Foreign Office! It's great that you're here!</p><p>And a big thank-you to the Mohn family, who support this through the Bertelsmann Stiftung.</p><p>Liz Mohn,</p><p>I listened very closely to your speech just now, especially when you mentioned that Bertelsmann is happy that people are reading more again and want to hold a book in their hands. I have two sons aged 18 and 14 and I haven't quite got that message through to them yet. Maybe you can help me out and we can try to persuade the two of them that it really can be a nice feeling to hold a book in your hands and to have to turn the pages over instead of simply swiping a screen.</p><p>So this is a welcome development. In my opinion, books and the feeling of being engrossed in them are still very, very valuable. Reading widens our horizons and encourages people to take a look at themselves and their surroundings. I would be absolutely delighted if this trend grew again in our society.</p><p>I heard that there were very lively and also very contentious discussions in the workshop both yesterday and today. And I'm very eager to find out more shortly about what you expect of the Europe of the future.</p><p>I would like to mention just three terms that currently define our discussions in Brussels and the talks with my European counterparts.</p><p>Ms Mohn already mentioned the first one, namely sovereignty. However, people understand this word in many different ways.</p><p>Some people see it as isolationism from the rest of the world. But we see it completely the other way round!</p><p>European sovereignty must always mean having a say and ensuring that Europe is heard in a world of increasing great-power rivalry.</p><p>At the Foreign Affairs Council, we regularly experience how individual countries hold up the decision-making by the other 26 members.</p><p>We think this has to stop. For that reason, we are talking with High Representative Josep Borrell about how we can gradually overcome this way of conducting politics of the lowest common denominator.</p><p>But to my mind, it is even more important that we Europeans do not allow ourselves to be divided or overruled by countries such as China or Russia or for that matter, as is unfortunately the case these days, in trade issues by the US.</p><p>That is exactly what we hope to help achieve during our EU Presidency in the second half of the year, for example by holding an EU-China summit and adopting a clear and agreed stance in our dealings with Moscow or Washington.</p><p>Something else is becoming very clear as regards China and the US, namely that sovereignty can no longer be defined purely in terms of foreign or security policy.</p><p>In the digital age, Europe also needs digital sovereignty. And this challenge affects us all.</p><p>In conjunction with 5G transmission power, artificial intelligence will create profound economic, social and personal change in our lives, ranging from the way we travel to daily life, such as shopping or consulting a doctor.</p><p>But algorithms can only be as intelligent as the data fed into them. This means that machines will only learn the values that are particularly dear to us Europeans if we teach them these values.</p><p>To achieve this, we need technological progress and skills. And if we're honest, Europe isn't really up to speed in that regard.</p><p>We currently face the threat of the digital world splitting into two parts.</p><p>On the one hand, we have Silicon Valley, which focuses more on the tech giants' profits than on our values.</p><p>And on the other, we have the Chinese model, which is becoming ever more important and powerful, but is also highly repressive and uses digital technology to monitor its own people.</p><p>I don't think either model is ideal. Europe would be well advised to pursue its own third way here.</p><p>Now in particular, when populists and extremists are attacking our democracy, we cannot allow control over technology or how we deal with criminal online content to lie solely with the big tech firms or foreign governments.</p><p>That's why we want to do our utmost to support the Commission in launching important parts of its digital strategy during our EU Presidency in the second half of the year.</p><p>And that's also why we want to ensure that technology, research and digital transformation are prioritised over other earlier key issues in the multiannual financial framework that is currently the topic of so much debate. There will also be disagreements about this, but we cannot avoid them.</p><p>In the final analysis, something very different is at stake. We want to transfer our European values to the digital age. And to be honest, when I look at the world, I ask myself who else will do this if we don't.</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation, which was so controversial at first, has now actually become a role model for many people in the world. And when it comes to digital transformation, Europe can show that it is possible both to protect civic rights and to make sovereign decisions as a tech leader.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,</p><p>This interpretation of sovereignty is closely linked to the second term we are discussing in Europe, namely the ability to act.</p><p>At the Munich Security Conference two weeks ago, everyone was talking about \"westlessness\", the West's apparent retreat from a leadership role in the world. And although I don't agree with dividing the world up into East, West, North or South, there is a dangerous gap in our neighbourhood in particular in this regard.</p><p>We just need to think about the conflicts surrounding our continent in Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, Libya and the Sahel. The US is increasingly withdrawing from its former role as global policeman and thus becoming less active in the world. And others are taking advantage of that, Russia, for example, or Turkey and Iran none of which always share our values or interests.</p><p>And what about Europe?</p><p>In my opinion, we Europeans cannot stand by and watch this development. Too much is at stake.</p><p>Our own stability and security depend on our neighbours' stability and our neighbourhood may be larger than some people believed in the past. That's why it is right that the new Commission wants to be a \"geopolitical Commission\".</p><p>Libya will be the first litmus test. After months of groundwork, Europeans are finally singing from the same song sheet. Unfortunately, this was not the case in the past. Here in Berlin and at a Foreign Ministers' meeting in Munich, we succeeded in paving the way towards a peace process that has already been far too long in the making. And naturally, Europe must also be willing to continue supporting this process, for example by monitoring the arms embargo now endorsed by parties that permanently violated it in recent weeks.</p><p>As in many other fields, the prerequisite is a clear political strategy, without which any military action will remain ineffective. Europe will only be able to act if we make use of all the instruments in our foreign policy toolbox from crisis prevention, arms control and humanitarian assistance to stabilisation, training and the deployment of security forces. And we will also play a part here during our EU Presidency, for example by opening a European centre of excellence for civilian crisis management here in Berlin, where we will work with our European partner countries to ensure that we do not only show up when the shooting has already started.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The third and last term I would like to mention for discussion is \"values\".</p><p>And when I talk about European values, I would like to start by saying today, the day when talks on our future relationship with the UK begin in Brussels, that the UK has left the EU, but we still share the same values.</p><p>So it's right that we offer the British the closest possible partnership:</p><p>a free trade area without customs</p><p>and close cooperation on foreign policy and security issues</p><p>But the prerequisite for this is that the UK does not circumvent European standards or weaken EU structures. We certainly will not engage in a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards or the rights of employees and consumers.</p><p>And there is another important point. When we talk about European values, we need to ensure that these values are not gradually eroded.</p><p>To that end, one very concrete objective of our Presidency is to get together for the first time to talk about how the rule of law is faring in each of our countries, but without pointing the finger at one another.</p><p>If there are shortcomings in Poland or Hungary and there are particular processes for that this is something we need to discuss. But there is no point simply criticising others the whole time. That will only achieve one thing, namely that governments will shut themselves off and Europe will become more divided.</p><p>Instead, our aim must be to support one another in order to resolve shortcomings and prevent them from arising in the future. And that is what we want to do in cooperation with the EU member states.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>At the end of the day, freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights are what define the EU. They are what keep us together. That is the actual centre of the EU, regardless of where its geographical centre may be. And this must never change.</p><p>As long as we take this to heart, I will not fear for the future of the EU. I look forward to having the chance to discuss all this with you now.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123532653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC6-9DK1-DYTH-G0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And, like always, this is a wonderful initiative: to bring together this broad community of very diverse individuals, from public sector to private sector. And I am so delighted to be joining you virtually today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of you may wonder why I so eagerly responded to Nancy's invitation. This is not only because of our long-lasting friendship, but also because of the unique composition of this remarkable group of yours. It is quite rare for a senior NATO official to address at the same time experts from all innovative areas, from business and technical leaders, philosophers, anthropologists, neuroscientists, doctors, artists, professors, researchers, NGO and public sector leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of you taking part in this conference in Berlin, or online like I do, may also be surprised to hear a NATO official speak so passionately on the topic of Artificial Intelligence. And on innovation more broadly.</p><p>But AI matters to NATO as much as it matters to our societies and economies. AI will not only change the way we live our lives but also the way we defend ourselves.</p><p>Exploring the relationship between AI and the conduct of warfare is something that NATO has been grappling with in recent years. We are taking these technological advances very seriously. Because they impact so much on our security, and security is NATO's core job.</p><p>For many centuries, security meant addressing threats on land and at sea. In the last century also in the air. But transformed by many recent advances in technology, threats today can take more shapes and come from multiple directions simultaneously.</p><p>They come from close at hand or from very far away, from remote sources. From humans or from unmanned systems. From space or from cyberspace. These trends are enhanced by rapidly developing technologies such as AI.</p><p>In keeping our one billion citizens safe requires NATO to tackle threats in the physical and virtual and digital worlds.</p><p>This means that today we need to defend ourselves against bullets and bombs, but also against algorithms and bots.</p><p>I am proud to say that we are at the forefront of innovation. Especially when it comes to innovating in the defence and security sector.</p><p>Some of our Allies, not least the United States, are already leading innovation in AI research and development. France and the UK allocate significant resources to develop AI in the defence sector. And a growing number of other Allies are making advances in this field as well.</p><p>But also as an organisation, NATO has the tools, the structures and the people in place to foster innovation.</p><p>To give you some examples, we have an Innovation Board at NATO which coordinates innovation efforts within the entire organisation. I chair this board. And it brings together external experts to challenge our existing approaches and procedures to this new and emerging technology.</p><p>There is also a dedicated team an Innovation Unit at NATO here in Brussels at our Headquarters. And all this eco-system of smart, talented and dedicated people helps NATO to better understand the implications of emerging and disruptive technologies, like the AI we are discussing today.</p><p>Our Strategic Command located in Norfolk Virginia, Allied Command Transformation, is leading NATO's work on innovation and disruptive technologies big data, artificial intelligence, robotics.</p><p>We have a Science and Technology office that taps into an active network of about 5,000 people. They, in turn, can reach out to an extended network of 200,000 colleagues. This makes our Science and Technology network the world's largest collaborative research forum in the field of defence and security.</p><p>The last example I want to mention today is the office for Women, Peace and Security at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. They are in the lead when it comes to finding innovative ways to mainstream gender across everything NATO does.</p><p>As part of its work, the WPS team is looking into the gendered impact of new tech. As you are very well aware, AI tools can contribute to the deepening of inequalities based on inherent biases. It can also create tools that challenge biases and stereotypes to help advance gender equality any equality in a broader sense.</p><p>NATO's ability to innovate is what has guaranteed our military superiority including our technological edge for the last seven decades.</p><p>But NATO and the West the political West - may now be on the verge of a new 'Sputnik Moment', moments where non-Western powers might actually overtake us.</p><p>We are competing with authoritarian regimes that misuse and abuse new technologies, including AI, to destabilise us, and to manipulate and disrupt our free and democratic way of life.</p><p>Last week, we just hosted and I chaired a North Atlantic Council meeting with the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of A Europe Fit for the Digital Age. And also she is the Commissioner for Competition. And it was a very, very intense and useful exchange of views between NATO and the EU because we need all the components of the political West, and NATO and the EU are two sides of the same coin to focus on new technology. And to make sure that we enforce complementarity and cooperation between NATO and the EU, and also harness the talent that exists all over the democratic world.</p><p>We must retain our technological edge and remain competitive in a more and more contested and competitive space. And for this, NATO needs to focus on the following:</p><p>We need to keep investing in modern, advanced technology. Because we cannot fight tomorrow's threats with yesterday's tools. And to keep us safe, we must ensure that our own militaries can perform better and faster.</p><p>We need to embrace the great opportunities that new technologies bring, both for our security and, of course, for our economic competitiveness. And also for the wellbeing of our citizens. We also need to ensure our societies and nations are resilient to these new challenges. These include data protection, impacts on labour markets, and protection from nefarious foreign investments and intellectual property theft that is where there is a need to fight it in a far more comprehensive way.</p><p>We need also to expand much more, and with more courage, our partnership with the private sector. Because private companies, from big tech to small start-ups, are driving technological innovation. So, we want to work closely with them and further promote the strengthening of our vibrant innovation eco-systems. These need to include universities and academics, as well as civil society.</p><p>In doing so, we need to leverage the comparative advantage that NATO has as an alliance. Together, our 30 countries, our 30 Allied nations, have an abundance of world-class academic institutions, the finest scientific researchers, amazingly creative start-ups and, yes, we have something that our competitors do not have a free and open society where talent can thrive, where people can speak their minds, they can innovate, they can make progress and can live fulfilled lives. And this is potential for even more synergies across the Euro-Atlantic area, from Silicon Valley to Estonia. And from the booming RandD and IT sectors in Romania to Vancouver. This is some great talent that we should tap into. And making sure that Allies, irrespective of their size, or the level of development of their economies, remain competitive and also to make sure that we keep the most important glue, the fundamental underpinning of our Alliance our values: democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law, and human rights.</p><p>I strongly believe that free, open and democratic societies are far more conducive for innovation and progress than their opposites. Also, as a Romanian, who has lived almost half of his life under Communist oppression, I know what I am talking about. And we are taking freedom and liberty very seriously.</p><p>To be true to our values, it is important to develop also international norms, rules and regulations for new technologies that will not stifle innovation, but will create a predictable environment for them to use their positive side for human advancement. We cannot allow anything and everything to happen in this space.</p><p>Our competitors may not want to face up to the important ethical dimensions in their race to develop and deploy technologies. But we here at NATO, we do. And we are strongly committed to International Laws and International Humanitarian Law.</p><p>Now, we are prepared to put on the table the hard ethical questions pertaining to emerging and disruptive technologies and discuss them with other stakeholders in an open mind-set.</p><p>And, to conclude, just a few months ago, the NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, launched a forward-looking reflection on NATO in the next decade. We name it 'NATO 2030'.</p><p>It is about making NATO stronger and prepared to tackle the unexpected in a turbulent world. We have been the most successful alliance in human history. We need to continue to be doing that. And much of the unexpected, this kind of turbulence we see all over comes from the rapid pace of technological change. Of course, from geo-political change, but also from technological change. So, we need to continue to adapt to this digital revolution.</p><p>As we do this, we want to engage with people like you, with smart, superb intellectuals and experts like yourselves.</p><p>Your knowledge, your experience, your ideas and also your ethical drive on the application of AI, in particular, and also its military application, are extremely valuable to us. And I hope that we can continue to engage together. With your help we can be better prepared today for the digital challenges of tomorrow.</p><p>I encourage all my colleagues across the NATO enterprise to reach out to you. As I do today, we need to engage with you in a more systematic way. And I want to encourage all of you to reach out to us because you are knocking here on open doors. We are here to be part of that great eco-system that keeps our democracies strong, our economies competitive, and our security impenetrable.</p><p>Thank you again, Nancy.

National arrogance and isolationism had culminated in two world wars two world wars which had wreaked death, misery and chaos on Europe. Adenauer's conviction had a profound influence on many people, including my parents. His core belief that \"we're Europeans first and Germans second\" is still a great inspiration to me today. For those who lived through the Second World War, a strong Europe, a united Europe, represented the future and the path to lasting peace. </p><p>But today some people harbour doubts about the European idea. Nationalism and populism are flaring up again and parties that are critical of the European project, or even reject it outright, are gaining ground in many countries. This is an alarming development. We must not forget the lessons from our history. Borders and walls within Europe have never created security. A united Europe has bestowed peace and prosperty to each Member State and its people the German people included. And the future challenges facing each and every one of us can only be met by working together in Europe. 1. Scepticism towards the advantages of EuropeAnd yet Europe is increasingly subject to criticism. Public scepticism towards Europe has grown: in 2007 some 57% of the EU population said they trusted the EU, but this share has now fallen to 44%.[1] At the same time, Eurosceptic parties have almost doubled their share of votes over the past ten years.[2] One explanation is that people feel unsettled, not only in the face of advancing globalisation and structural changes but also because of increasing migration. Far-reaching changes, fear and a sense of disorientation often cause people to reject what's new and retreat to what is familiar. And this withdrawal becomes menancing if people no longer want to exchange views and opinions and applaud seemingly simple answers as ultimate wisdom. It becomes dangerous if, owing to social media and the filter bubbles affecting what we see online, we merely find confimation of our own beliefs.[3] And such withdrawal becomes particularly dangerous if people lose empathy and the inherent willingness to take other people's viewpoints and values seriously. All of this leads to rejection and exclusion in our society. When people feel that their voices are no longer being heard and that they are no longer represented, populists find it easy to undermine the system and propagate simple solutions. The populists' success is based on the perception that they are seriously addressing people's concerns by proposing radical solutions. This is how they spread their new nationalism. Some Eurosceptic parties are pushing for a retreat from Europe, a withdrawal behind national borders. All too often, regaining national sovereignty is seen as an opportunity to acquire more freedom of action and security in the face of global developments. This suggests that we can preserve our prosperity by sealing ourselves off. This notion and the retreat to nationalist thinking is wrong. Because it fails to recognise the many benefits that Europe has brought us. Europe has brought peace. With the European Union we have found a way of resolving conflict that has ushered in the longest period of continuous peace in the history of Europe. The EU has transformed a continent of war into a continent of peace. We should not take this for granted and the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU reminds us not to do so. Europa has brought freedom. Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are prerequisites for EU membership. Let's not forget that in 1957, only 12 of the current Member States were democracies, compared with 28 now. Europe has provided an unprecedented degree of freedom of movement. Thanks to the EU, European citizens enjoy border-free travel and are free to study and work within the EU, creating inestimable development opportunities for everyone. And the consequences can be felt in everyday life:17 million people and 1.4 million commuters live or work in another Member State, approximately equivalent to the entire population of the Netherlands. And every year we cross one of the internal borders within the Schengen area an almost inconceivable 1.27 billion times.[4]Europe has brought prosperity. Some 25 years of the Single Market have generated real growth for more than 500 million consumers. Average per capita income in the EU has risen by half over this period.This last point, more prosperity across Europe, is one I must adress separately. Because the economic benefits of Europe are often a point of contention in Germany.Hardly any other economy has profited from the Single Market as much as Germany. Were it not for an open Europe and the creation of the Single Market, the robust economic growth of the post-war era would have levelled off over time. The free movement of goods, in other words, the abolishment of customs barriers and other obstacles, has created a large European market which promotes trade and growth. Likewise, the freedom of services has enabled people to offer their services in all EU countries. And the free movement of capital and payments created the conditions for the euro and a common financial market. Free movement of goods, capital and payments and freedom of services have allowed Europe to grow more closely together, have advanced the German economy and have brought prosperity to us all. German firms last year exported goods to the value of almost 780 billion to other EU Member States. Without trade barriers, without exchange rate risk. That accounts for almost two-thirds of all German exports. The Single Market creates and secures high-quality jobs in Germany. According to the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Single Market contributes 37 billion a year to German real GDP growth. That represents additional income of 450 per person and year.[5]We also owe these advantages to the euro, as the bulk of trade is invoiced in euro. The euro cements the Single Market; our common currency prevents exchange rate fluctuations and competetive devaluations between the Member States. The euro has thus provided stability and prosperity. Without the euro, open markets in Europe would not have lasted long. And all this has not only benefited enterprises, but first and foremost consumers too. The inflation rate has been stable for many years. For the euro it has averaged 1.7% since its introduction, compared with 2.8% for the D-Mark. I have now spoken about the past advantages of a united Europe. Let's now take a look at the future. Here, too, I am convinced that all of us, Germany too, will be able to master the challenges of the future in a united Europe. 2. The advantages of Europe for future challenges All countries in Europe face major, predominantly global, challenges, such as increasing worldwide competition, climate change and technological progress. a. Global competitionNo country, Germany included, can turn its back on globalisation if it wishes to secure future prosperity and distribute it evenly. And we need the EU in order to retain our capacity to act and to shape global developments. The economic weight of Europe's Member States has drastically declined over the past decades. Looking at the aggregate economic performance of EU countries, the EU's share in global economic output has fallen from around a third in the 1980s to a sixth today. Germany's share has more than halved over the same period and now stands at around 3%.And individual European countries will continue to lose their significance in the world, for one because our birth rate is far lower than that of other countries. More than 500 million people now live in the EU, representing 8% of the world's population. In 2050, this share will have declined to just 5%.[6] The German population will then make up no more than 0.8% of people in the world. In such an interconnected world, individual countries will therefore find it increasingly difficult to uphold their prosperity and social security provisions. Globalisation reduces the capacity of individual countries to levy corporate taxes and finance their social security systems. Free movement of capital allows enterprises to use differences between tax systems to their advantage and to distribute both profits and intangible assets across different countries. This leads to corporate tax bases being eroded. The OECD estimates that the global revenue shortfall owing to tax avoidance amounts to between 4% and 10% of corporate income tax receipts.[7]Moreover, globally-active companies can threaten to cut jobs and move production to other countries. Countries are thus tempted to use lower labour and social security standards to their competitive advantage and enter into a race to the bottom, making it harder for them to defend their social standards. By pulling together, countries in Europe are in a better position to withstand global developments. As a whole, Europe is still large and economically significant enough to tax corporate profits and put an end to social dumping. The EU is a market that firms can hardly do without. Power lies in numbers. That is especially true for trade. The EU is the most tightly integrated economic region in the world. Two-thirds of EU trade takes place with other Member States. And around 50% of cross-border financial holdings in the euro area are from other euro area countries. That is true for Germany too. In practical terms, this means, for example, that Germany exports more goods to France than to China. So it's not surprising that turning away from Europe could have disasterous consequences for our prosperity. One study shows that, for example, new trade restrictions in Europe could reduce Germany's economic output by 8 %.[8] In their external trade, too, countries that go it alone only stand to lose. No country has the heft required to make itself heard in international trade talks and signficantly influence trade conditions. And no national economy is large enough to set the common standards for globally integrated value chains. Neither is Germany: our share in global trade is only half the size of that of the EU. Moreover, Germany's significance for world trade is set to dwindle further in future. The European Commission predicts that, over the next 10 to 15 years, 90% of global growth will be generated outside of Europe. But in Germany especially, employment relies heavily on open markets and international trade: nigh on 30% of German jobs depend directly or indirectly on exports, and this is true for as many as every second job in industry.[9]If we are to profit from this international growth, we need open markets and a strong voice in international trade talks. Only the EU can offer us these. The EU improves the ability of all Member States to control outcomes. By acting together, we can attain objectives that we would have been unable to reach alone. For the EU is the main trading partner for 80 countries worldwide. And with the combined weight of EU Member States in global value chains, European firms can set their standards throughout the world.[10] b. Climate change Ladies and gentlemen, joint action in Europe is also needed to overcome a completely different challenge facing all countries, namely climate change. People in this country are serious about tackling climate change. But countries cannot win the struggle against climate change on their own: pollution does not respect borders. Think of, say, pollution entering the Rhine or the Danube and potentially affecting another country further downstream. Or the acid rain caused by UK coal-fired power plants in the 1980s which harmed the forests and lakes of Scandinavia. Climate change is a global phenomenon that poses complex coordination issues for national governments and affects many areas of life, including the economy. Allow me to concentrate on some of the economic consequences of climate change. That in itself will reveal the immensity of the challenges which we can only successfully overcome together. For one, climate change affects competitiveness in the Single Market. As trade in goods and services expands, it's important to ensure a level playing field. However, individual countries may implement environmental measures that distort competition. That can happen if, for example, production standards are lowered in a bid to achieve cost advantages. Amid international competition, such practices can lead to environmental dumping with detrimental consequences not only for the Single Market but also for the environment. So countries have to work together to stop this dangerous dynamic.Even the direct effects of climate change alone may have an enormous impact on the economy. Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns may depress earnings in different economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, tourism or construction. And that may also affect the financial system. If companies have serious difficulty in repaying their loans or disbursing dividends, banks and their creditors and investors will in turn suffer damages too. Moreover, environmental and climate protection measures may have extensive economic consequences. The bans on diesel cars and the fall-out from the emissions scandal, for example, not only triggered a decline in car manufacturers' share prices, but also in the prices for used diesel cars. And handling the trend towards electromobility is testing the German automobile industry's future viability to the limit. All of this shows the extent to which climate change and environmental measures can affect economic activity, assets and jobs. Europe offers a unique opportunity to combat climate change and so reduce the potential damage to the economy.Europe can provide well-coordinated instruments and clear, reliable regulation, such as the Europe-wide carbon floor price. The European emissions trading scheme with fixed caps on emissions is the first and largest of its kind worldwide. As one of the three largest economic blocs in the world, Europe can be at the vanguard of the fight against climate change. Europe has long campaigned internationally for strong and binding targets. For one, the EU built up a broad alliance of industrial and developing countries with ambitious targets, which significantly contributed to the success of the Paris Conference. Moreover, the EU was the first large economic region to present its planned contribution to the agreement as early as in March 2015. And Europe can ensure that the financial market helps attain climate targets. It has now become clear that market participants are failing to take the social costs of their activities for the environment fully into account, leading to a lack of sustainable finance. This arises, for example, when market participants base their investment decisions on excessively short time horizons and fail to factor in environmental risks. Because they would otherwise, from a risk perspective, steadily shift the focus of their investment to green and sustainable assets and so contribute to the attainment of the climate targets. Europe can give impetus and set up the right framework.[11]Central banks such as the European Central Bank can also help to fight climate change. First, the ECB can contribute to the development of tools and methods that can be used to identify, quantify and mitigate climate-related risks in the financial system.Second, the ECB can use its investment portfolio to help fight climate change. For example, sustainability criteria are already taken into account in our portfolios that are not held for monetary policy purposes. We have also bought green bonds under our asset purchase programme. But we have to make sure that we are not creating market distortions, of course we have to remain market-neutral. This means that the ECB can only buy a limited amount of the green bonds available on the market. Third, the ECB together with other leading central banks can examine the potential effects of climate change on the conduct of monetary policy. We are still in the early stages of our research into whether and how climate change affects the transmission channels of monetary policy and could lead to bigger and more persistent shocks that could have consequences for price stability, among other things.Fourth, forward-looking banking supervision can urge banks to ensure that they have an overview of the climate-related risks on their balance sheets, and that they do so on a continual basis and with reference to stress scenarios. This is the approach that European banking supervision is taking. c. PaymentsI have talked about the major challenges facing Europe. But there are also areas which are less prominent and not quite so fundamental, but which are still important in our interconnected world. Payments are one such example. Safe, reliable and efficient payment systems are a vital part of a well-functioning and integrated economy.Technological progress and changing payment habits have fundamentally altered the payment system and thrown up new challenges. End users now expect to be able to transfer money around the world in real time and at low cost.But existing payment systems are fragmented along national lines. The German Girocard scheme and the French Carte Bancaire, for example, are both used by large numbers of end users in their domestic markets, but they exist in parallel and separately from one another. Many payment service providers retreat behind national boundaries on account of national interests and preferences. And customers can see this. If they want to make cross-border payments in Europe with ease, they frequently rely on global players such as VISA, Mastercard and PayPal. And the big tech companiesalso offer payment solutions with pan-European reach. This is easier for them, since their global customer base allows them to achieve the desired network effects.At the moment there are only a handful of large payment service providers offering pan-European payment services. New payment methods are being developed, such as Facebook's planned digital currency, Libra, and its underlying payment system.According to current plans, users across the globe should be able to make payments not in euro or US dollars, but in Libra. We will need to carefully monitor how this will affect competition, because a lack of competition can impair the efficiency and quality of services in the long term, to the detriment of consumers. Irrespective of how the payments landscape evolves over the coming years, it is essential that users of the various payment systems can be confident that all payment solutions, old and new alike, are safe and efficient. To ensure that we have a safe, efficient and modern European payment system in the long term, though, we will need to work together at the European level. National solutions on their own don't have the necessary weight to achieve sufficient scale and network effects. What a future-oriented European payment system needs most of all are efficient, future-oriented, pan-European market initiatives. The Eurosystem would welcome such initiatives and would likely support them, within the limits of its mandate. A European payment system which has cross-border reach, supports modern payment methods and is accessible to all could set global standards. And it would also foster integration in Europe.It would allow people across Europe to make transactions cheaply and safely, and this would enhance the benefits of the Single Market, making it more efficient, more innovative and better able to support growth and prosperity in all EU countries. An integrated market would thus increase the benefits of Europe for all countries. 3. A plea for more European integrationCreating optimum conditions for the Single Market and the euro is also in Germany's interest. And optimum conditions include not just the type of robust payment system I have just been talking about, but also the lasting stabilisation and deepening of Economic and Monetary Union. This topic has many different aspects, but I would like to focus today on one key question: how can we advance the banking union project? area firms still obtain most of their funding through banks. A robust banking sector is thus vital for a healthy European economy and a stable single currency. We need a banking sector that is able to offer services to customers across Europe. And we need a market in which banks can compete on a level playing field.And the banking union a single framework for the supervision and resolution of banks in the euro area has already come a long way. All euro area banks are now supervised according to the same high standards. And the single mechanism for resolution ensures that cross-border bank resolutions can be carried out without damaging either the economy or financial stability. But the banking union is still lacking an important component: a European deposit insurance scheme. For there to be an integrated banking sector and a true banking union, depositors in all countries must have the same level of confidence in their banks. People must be able to have confidence that their money is equally safe wherever it is deposited. In the long run this can only be done through a European deposit insurance scheme. A shared scheme would make Economic and Monetary Union more robust. It would allow financial resources to be pooled between countries and to be used to tackle severe shocks and systemic financial crises that go beyond the capacity of individual countries. But it is difficult to reach agreement on this degree of joint liability. If we are to move forward on this, I believe that the journey would need to include three steps.First, all members of a shared deposit insurance scheme would need to continue to do everything they can to further reduce risks in their banks. Stable banks are, after all, the best form of protection for deposits. Second, the shared insurance should be introduced gradually, and in such a way that individual countries would provide a minimum level of funding to cover national deposits. Third, it is critical that banks' contributions to the deposit insurance scheme are risk-based in other words, that the contribution of each bank is based on the institution's default risk and the amounts involved. These three features of a shared deposit insurance scheme would strengthen the individual responsibility of Member States, banks and shareholders and further incentivise risk-based behaviour. And this would ultimately be to the benefit of the EU and all its member countries. 4. Finding a common way in EuropeLadies and gentlemen,I can't say it often enough: Europe is our shared opportunity. Europe is our opportunity to act together where we face global challenges. After all, no country Germany included can by itself meaningfully shape the trading system, the battle against climate change or technological progress. More Europe is therefore the way forward in such an interconnected world.But don't get me wrong this is not an appeal for Europe to regulate all aspects of our lives. The EU brings together the shared features of the 28 Member States, but also their many differences. Successful cooperation requires us to work on the basis of shared values, objectives and cooperation principles, of course. We need to observe the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality that have always governed the EU's powers. These principles help us to ensure that cultural diversity and national identities are recognised and respected. In other words, that we are \"united in diversity\". This is an approach that has proved its worth and we should continue to build on it in the future, ensuring that political decisions are made as close to the public as possible.And despite all the benefits and the motto \"united in diversity\", there is growing scepticism about Europe. One of the frequent complaints is that the EU always operates on the basis of rigid legal principles, making it seem often technocratic and somehow remote. This criticism applies to all European institutions and we shouldn't just brush it aside. I firmly believe that the time has come for us to redefine the way in which we work and, in particular, the way in which we communicate. And this applies to the European Central Bank too. The ECB needs to address all citizens, not just an expert audience without ever becoming political, of course - but only in order to bring facts and explanations to economic issues. \"Do good and talk about it\" in simple and accessible language should be the motto here. The people of Europe need to be given much more information about what the EU and its institutions are doing on their behalf and that information should be coming not just from the EU institutions themselves but most of all from national governments and institutions. Only then will we be able to tackle people's fear and disorientation. Only then will we be able to counter the growing polarisation among the people of Europe. So we should not be communicating through complex facts, coefficients and rules. This only reinforces the impression that the EU is an arrogant elite that already knows all the answers.We will also need to work fundamentally on our understanding of politics and our culture of debate. Communication between the public and institutions needs to involve a great deal of commitment and to flow in both directions. The people need to be included so that we can regain their trust and convince them that the EU works for them and takes their concerns seriously.[12]A concept that has worked well in a number of countries is that of deliberative democracy. It essentially involves allowing the public to play a greater role in political decision-making processes.Ireland provides an instructive example of how this can work. In Ireland 99 randomly selected members of the public are brought together to discuss and deliberate on various issues, such as global warming, the challenges arising from demographic change or the law on abortion. The topic of abortion, for example, was for many years a very controversial topic in Ireland, and one that polarised society. And so, before a referendum on abortion was held, a citizens' assembly was brought together to discuss the issue. The results of the conversations were published in a report and debated in Parliament. And while public reaction had initially been divided on the matter, the result of the referendum ultimately largely reflected the outcome of the citizens' assembly, which supported the right to abortion.Many participants reported that the citizens' assembly had brought logic and structure to the discussion and allowed important facts to emerge. It had also shifted what had initially been a very emotional debate to a more rational plane and helped people to understand complex issues. In the end, the referendum did not lead to a massive divide in society, as had initially been thought. It was instead a process that gave rise to a clear result and social consensus.A similar kind of model for exchanging views and participating in political discussions on European matters could also serve Europe well. Citizens' assemblies could be a helpful way of bringing together citizens in a given country to talk about European issues. The example of Ireland shows that citizens' assemblies are particularly effective when they discuss a concrete topic. But it could also be helpful to have European citizens' assemblies, which would allow citizens of different countries to exchange ideas. It is particularly important that, within Europe, we develop additional methods and tools which establish shared values that transcend national borders and cultural differences and give rise to a sense of shared objectives. Assemblies like these could also strengthen the dialogue between the people and the EU institutions. EU politicians and civil servants would be better able to understand the concerns of citizens, and thus better able to represent them. And the EU would be brought closer to the people and enjoy greater trust.All of this requires hard work, commitment and perseverance, since diversity can slow down the decision-making process. Yes, discussions at the European level take longer than those at the corresponding national level. After all, the many different interests and approaches that often have their roots in national traditions need to be thoroughly discussed and compromises found. And even if it does take longer, we all stand to gain from closer cooperation within Europe. We need two things here. First, the determination to hold constructive discussions to establish shared values and objectives. And second, the ability to push through our values and objectives in a globalised world.I believe that Europe can offer both of these things. ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,Europe's achievements are significant. Never before in the history of our continent have we lived together in such peace for so long, and never before have we enjoyed such freedom. Europe has brought us considerable prosperity, and this has benefited all countries, including Germany. None of this should be taken for granted.And yet, Europe faces criticism.The major challenges we face, such as globalisation, structural change and migration, are unsettling people and causing many to feel a sense of fear and disorientation. It is then often easier to think in national terms and to ignore the problems to a certain degree. And populists are exploiting this situation to spread a new kind of nationalism a withdrawal from Europe. I believe that this national way of thinking is dangerous.And that's because the global challenges affect all countries. At a time when all European countries are seeing their influence wane in the world, we need to hold together if we want to uphold our values and interests in the world.As Konrad Adenauer once said, \"No European nation is able to protect itself militarily or develop economically on its own. If one wanted today to uphold the traditional concepts of nationalism, this would be a task for Europe\".And this is why we need a return to Europe, a process of politicisation which encourages people across Europe to find their way back to a common path. We need to work on loosening entrenched debates, understanding differences of opinion and arriving at compromises. Only by doing so will we be able to ensure that the people of Europe stand by an EU that is internally united and externally strong.Germany needs to play its role in Europe. This is not just in the interests of Europe, it is in the interests of Germany too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123335493</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJX-MW91-JCBF-S05T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5154\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A new year is usually the time when we regain confidence in the future and in our collective ability to prepare for it.     ***   However there are many uncertainties weighing on the global economic outlook.  In Europe, there are still many uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations and the vote over the withdrawal agreement. Caution requires that we all be prepared for a no-deal scenario. Public authorities and most importantly market participants have all prepared serious contingency plans to address and master the cliff-edge risks associated with such a no-deal scenario. </p><p>As a result, we can expect that those risks will be appropriately managed, without financial stability implications, should such a scenario occur.  Outside Europe, global trade tensions are also generating additional uncertainties. Protectionism can indeed be a temptation, but in my view it should not be an option. Let\u2019s be clear: our economies are increasingly integrated, and research conducted at the Banque de France suggests that a rise in protectionism on a large scale (i.e. a generalised trade war scenario) would have a negative impact on global growth.  Yet these uncertainties can be turned into opportunities and I would like to emphasise that. It is worth noting that EU Member States remained impressively united behind their negotiator, <person><nameText>Michel Barnier, </nameText></person>during the Brexit talks. This unity must now be directed towards achieving an ambition: completing and strengthening the economic and monetary union.  This period of uncertainties actually reminds us that bilateral and multilateral cooperation are quite valuable, as they are a common wealth enhancer, especially when the issue at stake is financial regulation and financial stability. At the end of 2017, central bankers and supervisors reached a very important agreement on the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. This agreement must now be implemented in various jurisdictions to further increase the soundness of the banking system. Since the great financial crisis, other issues have emerged. Cyber-risks have risen significantly over the last few years and the financial sector remains a primary target. The surge of crypto-assets is another challenge for regulators given the risks they pose for consumer protection and anti-money laundering. To address these risks adequately, the digital and global nature of crypto-assets calls for an international approach.   *   Cooperation is all the more necessary as the major financial centres, including Paris and Hong Kong, are highly interconnected.  I believe that Paris today has all the attributes necessary to become the pre-eminent financial trading and financing hub for continental Europe. Some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, asset managers and insurers are already preparing for life after Brexit and steering their European operations away from London to our capital. Paris is already home to four of the eight global systemically important banks in the euro area, in addition to being number one in the region in insurance and asset management. Recent regulatory initiatives have made Paris even more dynamic. Capitalising on the reform of Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP) in 2016, a number of very innovative projects have been launched: for instance, the Frenchtelecoms company Orange and the fintech SETL have jointly set up a new central securities depository (CSD) called ID2S for the NEU CP market, using blockchain technology.  Paris is also at the heart of cross-border initiatives, making the European financial market more integrated. The market exchange operator Euronext is continuing to expand its federal model and in November 2017 acquired the Irish Stock Exchange. The CSD Euroclear is also committed to fostering common infrastructures, and is even looking beyond Europe with partnerships in the United States with DTCC or in Asia thanks to Bond Connect.  Building on this comprehensive financial ecosystem, Paris has also been one of the principal supporters of the renminbi\u2019s move towards internationalisation. As of today, Paris is indeed the leading continental European centre for deposits and bond issuances in RMB. This support was embodied and exemplified as early as 2014 with the signature by the Banque of France of two memorandums of understanding with the HKMA and the People\u2019s Bank of China.  ***     Cooperation will also prove invaluable in the face of the uncertainty caused by structural challenges.  A first structural challenge is the digital revolution. The digital revolution is being fuelled by a wave of cutting-edge technologies, but also by the surge of new players. This new competition is being driven by fintech start-ups, but also, more importantly, by tech firms that have started to expand into the financial sector. Here in Asia, you can testify as to just how rapidly big tech firms can impact the financial sector. While ensuring a level playing field between competitors, our role as a central bank and supervisor is to guarantee that the digital revolution eventually delivers on its promises regarding increased security and efficiency. At the same time, incumbents should be prepared to adapt. Their business models are being challenged by the unbundling of financial services and by increasing customer expectations in terms of responsiveness and autonomy.  The answers are not easy and cannot be uniform, but I expect that only the most digitally agile financial companies will eventually prove financially resilient. Against this background, France has many assets that can make it a leader in digital innovation in Europe, and the Banque de France is committed to playing its part in this regard. Through its Fintech Innovation Hub, which has welcomed over 400 innovative players since 2016, the Banque de France promotes active and open dialogue with all market stakeholders, with the aim of building streamlined regulation for digital innovation.  The Banque de France is also committed to leveraging new technologies for its own digital transformation. We are already running an interbank blockchain called \u201cMADRE\u201d to automate the generation of creditor identifiers. I am convinced that by conducting their own experiments, central banks and regulators are more capable of designing relevant policies and regulations for digital finance.   *   A second structural challenge is climate change, which is perhaps less tangible than the digital revolution but certainly no less significant.  The transition to a low-carbon economy requires shifting thousands of billions of dollars from carbon intensive industries. As a result, beyond green bonds, we also have to develop new financial products to bridge this green finance gap. I am thinking of green securitisation, green covered bonds, and green loans accessible to individuals, SMEs and start-ups. France is at the forefront of this challenge. Four out of the world\u2019s top ten green bond book-runners are French banks. France is among the top three green bond issuers. This trend is being supported by public action: a law has been introduced requiring investors and listed companies to disclose their climate-related risks; the French State issued the largest green sovereign bond in 2017.  We also believe that central banks and supervisors must play their part as, in the long run, climate stability is one of the main determinants of financial stability, which is their mandate. This is a shared conviction. At the One Planet Summit in Paris in December 2017, the Banque de France, with the support of other central banks and supervisors, launched the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which now comprises some 30 central banks, supervisors and international organisations, including four Asian members, and will certainly attract more in the coming years. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN753490220190116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6P-RXV1-DXCW-D1DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Member for Clwyd South (Simon Baynes): I congratulate him on his excellent maiden speech but offer my condolences, and I am sure those of every Opposition Member, on the loss of his mother. I am sure that his mother would have been immensely proud of him not only for being elected to the House, but for the speech he has just made. He is just starting out on his parliamentary career\u2014he is almost exactly the same age as I am; in other words, just about reaching his prime in life. I take this opportunity to declare that I think I am now officially the longest-serving Welsh MP from any party in this House. I think I signed in before my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David) in 2001, and I am therefore claiming the title Tad y T\u0177\u2014 \u201cFather of the House\u201d in Welsh\u2014at least for this gathering today.</p><p>I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the charity that he set up, Concertina, and I very much agree with what he said about the power of music and its impact on older people. Having volunteered for a charity in a care home to play music to older people, I look forward to talking to him more about the work that he has been undertaking. I also thank him for paying tribute, quite properly, to his predecessor, Susan Elan Jones, who really was the best of us as a Member of Parliament, from any party, and who was a great champion in this place for Wales and particularly for the Welsh language.</p><p>It is a great pleasure to speak in today\u2019s debate from the Back Benches, having served almost continuously for 15 years on the Front Benches, both in government and in opposition. It is quite a relief to have the freedom to roam and talk about anything I want. Today, I want to talk about the future of public service broadcasting in Wales, in particular BBC Cymru Wales, ITV Wales and Sianel Pedwar Cymru\u2014S4C\u2014not least in the light of the publication this morning by Ofcom of its five-year review of public service broadcasting, \u201cSmall Screen: Big Debate\u201d. The key finding in the report is that public service broadcasting remains extremely important and relevant to the UK as whole, but I think that is especially true for us in Wales.\u200b</p><p>On St David\u2019s Day 1967, BBC Wales opened Broadcasting House in Llandaff in my constituency. After 53 years, it recently moved to a brand-new, high-tech, modern headquarters just over the River Taff in the city centre. It remains a major employer for my constituents and residents of many other constituencies across Wales. Of more than 1,000 employees, many live in Cardiff West. BBC Cymru Wales is a key community partner in my constituency for the new state-of-the-art Cardiff West Community High School, which the Labour council recently built with funding assistance from the Welsh Government. That partnership provides exciting opportunities for students from the communities of Ely and Caerau who badly need them. Indeed, Caerau boy and top BBC talent Jason Mohammad was at the opening of the school, which was built on the site of the school he attended, to promote its partnership with the BBC.</p><p>I say all that to remind the House that public service broadcasting in the form of BBC Cymru Wales, ITV Wales and S4C, and the many producers and other ancillary services it supports, plays a huge role in Welsh culture, Welsh society and the Welsh economy. That includes Welsh language television and radio programming, which plays a key part in promoting and building the language and will make a vital contribution to achieving the Welsh Government\u2019s aspiration of having 1 million Welsh speakers by 2050. Part of the licence fee now funds the Welsh language channel S4C, so proposals to scrap or even, as I understand someone from No. 10 said, to \u201cwhack\u201d the licence fee without properly examining the consequences threaten the culturally and socially vital programming that is so important to Wales as a nation. A purely profit-drive subscription system would destroy public service broadcasting, in particular S4C.</p><p>The Prime Minister likes to make a big point about his undying love for the Union, but it is strange how cavalier his Government are about Wales\u2019s presence and influence within the Union. There seems to be a complete lack of understanding of the importance of the licence fee, the BBC charter and public service broadcasting more generally to Wales\u2019 place as one of the four constituent nations of the United Kingdom. The BBC, ITV Wales and S4C are major Welsh employers, both indirectly and directly. They have brought many programmes we are all familiar with\u2014\u201cDoctor Who\u201d, \u201cPobol y Cwm\u201d, \u201cCasualty\u201d, \u201cTorchwood\u201d, \u201cLife on Mars\u201d, \u201cSherlock\u201d, \u201cHinterland\u201d, \u201cKeeping Faith\u201d and \u201cGavin and Stacey\u201d\u2014to UK-wide and indeed global audiences. Today, the Ofcom report shows that public service broadcasting production in Wales has risen threefold since 2010. It is still only 3% of the total, so there is room for further growth, but it is hugely important in our economy and a growing sector.</p><p>BBC Wales and S4C play huge roles in promoting Welsh music, employing musicians and composers not just through things like the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, but through Welsh language music on Radio Cymru and S4C. I say to some colleagues on the Government Benches, who seem to be playing with the concept, that they should resist the temptation to pull at the loose threads of a carefully woven shawl that has been bequeathed to us, just because it looks slightly frayed at the edges. They risk unravelling something precious that can never be recreated.\u200b</p><p>Quite rightly, there is a debate at Welsh and UK level about the role that public service broadcasting can play in a new world in which we consume our media from a variety of different sources. The founders of the BBC in the 1920s could not have imagined a world in which people could pick up a mobile phone and watch whatever content they cared to choose\u2014as the old Martini ad used to say, \u201cany time, any place, anywhere\u201d. The underlying question for this new world, however, is \u201cDoes the concept of public service broadcasting still have relevance?\u201d, and I would argue that, more than ever, it does. In this information free-for-all, the original founding values of the BBC resonate more loudly than ever. In an era of fake news, when conspiracy theorists thrive and journalistic integrity is routinely questioned and undermined by, I have to say, all sides in the political debate, the BBC\u2019s mission to \u201cinform, educate and entertain\u201d has never been more important.</p><p>Some ask why public service broadcasters need to entertain when entertainment can be supplied by the market. There are times, I agree, when those broadcasters can be legitimately criticised for straying too far in the direction of content of questionable public value, but we have to realise that in a world of high-tech global corporations hoovering up data and monopolising gateways to content, our cultural sovereignty will suffer without the public service broadcasting framework. It would be ironic if, having supposedly voted to take back control, we handed over the remote control from Cardiff West or Westminster to the west wing of the White House and big tech\u2019s west coast of America.</p><p>We therefore need new, flexible regulations to guarantee continuing prominence for public service content, even when the gateway to that content is through a set-top box, a smart TV or a smart speaker. In a world in which Amazon determines what is on the home page of a deliberately discounted loss-leader television monitor, there is a danger that public service content will be locked in a dark cupboard with no key easily available. S4C already suffers from that on the electronic programme guide, having been relegated to channel 166 on Virgin Media and multiple clicks away from the home page of a Sky+ box.</p><p>It should be obvious that we need to ensure that trusted, curated information is available to young people in particular, and that they can distinguish between fact and fake, between informed opinion and hateful prejudice. What future is there for democracy without an informed next generation in Wales and beyond with the skills to navigate the deluge of information in the digital era? Public service broadcasting and streaming, through content such as BBC Bitesize, \u201cNewsround\u201d and \u201cMy World\u201d, can help to thwart the penetration of untrustworthy news sources to younger generations.</p><p>In fact, Ofcom is currently consulting on changes proposed by the BBC to reinvent the service that \u201cNewsround\u201d provides for young people by replacing its evening bulletin with more online content, which already has nearly 1 million users a week compared with the 35,000 six-to-12 year-olds who currently watch the televised 4 pm bulletin. The fact that younger people watch less linear television does not mean that they will not consume public service content, provided that it is made available to them in places where they look for their content.\u200b</p><p>I was going to say something about sports rights and, in particular, the need for the Six Nations to be put on the category A list, but I do not want to detain the House for too long, so I will just say a bit more about the licence fee. The Government have launched a public consultation on the so-called decriminalisation of non-payment. That proposal was not in the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto. It has been launched within a few years of a previous review which provided clear evidence that decriminalisation would not help those in Wales struggling with their bills, would draw more people into the courts, and would undermine the funding of the BBC.</p><p>That review, the Perry review, clearly concluded that the current system was the fairest, and that any move towards decriminalisation of non-payment of the fee would undermine the BBC\u2019s ability to enforce the licence and would not remove the risk of imprisonment. In any case, imprisonment is not an available punishment for non-payment of the licence fee; it is a penalty available to the courts for wilful refusal or culpable neglect on the part of the offender to pay any court-ordered fines. Often, those who are caught for non-payment are fined the value of the fee itself and no criminal case is brought. When cases are brought, the only directly available penalty is a maximum fine of \u00a31,000 and no criminal record, with actual fines served averaging \u00a3176.</p><p>Furthermore, the Perry review outlined that the current regime serves as an effective deterrent, maintaining the offending rate at a very low 5%. One has to question the Government\u2019s motives in reopening this issue now, in the light of that very recent evidence. If they really want to ease the burden of the licence fee on any group of people, why do they not reinstate free television licences for those over 75 rather than passing the buck on to an already underfunded BBC with no means of sustaining it, and simultaneously undermining BBC finances through this bogus consultation?</p><p>This is all part of an agenda by some to undermine, to cut and eventually to privatise large swaths of the BBC, including BBC Cymru Wales. It is also a direct threat to employment in Wales, particularly in my constituency of Cardiff West. As this proposal is not a manifesto pledge, the House of Lords would have every right to reject it if, as expected, the Government decide to ram it through for ideological reasons using their Commons majority. If ever there was an instance in which the Salisbury convention would apply, this is it. The method of enforcing licence fee collection should not be changed before the next charter renewal in 2027. Labour and the Conservatives, and the other parties, can set out in their manifestos for the next election\u2014probably in 2024\u2014where they stand on this issue.</p><p>Public service broadcasting through BBC Cymru Wales, ITV Wales and S4C plays a huge part in the lives of our constituents. They are major employers and cultural leaders, and they produce trusted quality television, radio and online content. Back in 1964, Wales got its very own TV service. It was our service and our programming, reflective of our talent and our culture, with content made in Wales by Wales, for Wales and beyond and recognised worldwide. In fact, the Union is stronger for our role in providing some of the UK\u2019s leading TV, film, radio and online exports.</p><p>Public service broadcasting might need to be renamed in the age of digital streaming, perhaps as \u201cpublic service media\u201d, but whatever we call it, we should value\u200band nurture it. We should ensure that it is not locked away in that dark cupboard where it is difficult to find. We should ensure that it has a sustainable source of funding\u2014either through advertising, in the case of some public service broadcasters, or through the licence fee for others\u2014that allows it to remain independent of Government. We should acknowledge its relevance in a world of fake news, and for Wales we should fight to protect, preserve and enhance it so that it can continue to play a positive role in the language, culture, life and economy of our nation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3024860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB8-DNP1-F0YC-N4D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2194\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1F7</classCode><className>BRITISH PARLIAMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Governments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001004</classCode><className>LANGUAGE &amp; LANGUAGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A6OA</classCode><className>SENIOR CITIZENS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DODV</classCode><className>SENIOR HOUSING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX351</classCode><className>CARDIFF, WALES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Members for Stourbridge (Suzanne Webb) and for West Bromwich East (Nicola Richards)?</p><p>The business of tax avoidance, as has been discussed this afternoon, is a serious issue. We show extraordinary world leadership in this, but for all the wrong reasons. Since 2010, a permissive attitude to tax avoidance has been allowed to develop. Let us think back to Chancellor George Osborne and how he advised people on TV just to think, \u201cWell, you know, all you need is clever financial products to help reduce your tax costs\u201d. It really sent out the wrong signal\u2014\u201cWhy pay tax at all? Pay the least you possibly can\u201d\u2014as opposed to being responsible and recognising the benefits of tax.</p><p>That has been facilitated by the growth of professional enablers. We saw that with the Panama papers, which laid bare the industrial-scale activity in tax havens such as the British overseas territories and Crown dependencies. We think of the Cayman Islands, which is the most secretive territory of all, and the British Virgin Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, which are in the top 20. Just last week, the EU blacklisted the Cayman Islands as the first UK territory on the non-co-operative list due to its tax haven status.</p><p>Do not get me wrong\u2014I understand that this is a global problem and it needs international action\u2014but we actually have to go to Davos to talk about these things, and of course the Prime Minister was a no-show there as well. It needs international action, and the UK should be looking to lead on this to restore its reputation. We need leadership, not just simply to be tax lackeys. The Government need to exercise control, not cede control. Let us look at the big accountancy firms. I appreciate the points made by the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), and I agree with him that on the one hand they are advising the Government, but on the other hand they are advising businesses, and I do not see how we can quite square that particular circle.</p><p>Mr Kevan Jones</p><p>Does my hon. Friend agree that it is long overdue that some of the big accountancy firms should be broken up? There is not really competition among these firms; there are cartels in some situations.</p><p>Matt Western</p><p>My right hon. Friend makes a very good point. With just those four businesses, they absolutely dominate the sector. I do fear that there is a cartel operating, and the sector should be broken up. I think that would be in everyone\u2019s interests. Those firms\u2014or certainly their UK arms\u2014account, according to an HMRC report, for half of all known avoidance schemes. That is the scale of the problem.</p><p>This is coming at a massive cost\u2014a loss to UK plc\u2014that is estimated at between \u00a335 billion and \u00a390 billion. There is understandable public anger out there, because that money could be buying significant investments in our communities, whatever people may want to invest it in. That could be 40 new hospitals, two new aircraft carriers or 40 Typhoon jets\u2014all for \u00a335 billion, with some cash to spare. If the \u00a390 billion takes their fancy, we could electrify the Chiltern line serving Warwick and Leamington, and then put money into free school meals for all. Instead, we have an attitude where we increasingly see flat regressive taxes, such as the rise in VAT in 2010 from 17.5% to 20% and the growing expansion of council tax, again hurting hard-pressed households.</p><p>Matt Rodda (Reading East) (Lab)</p><p>My hon. Friend is making some excellent points about the inequities in the system. I feel that is particularly relevant given that only recently did average incomes catch up with those before the great crash of 2008. Does he agree that there has been a total and utter lack of leadership from the Government on this matter?</p><p>Matt Western</p><p>Yes, there has. As I have said, the former Chancellor showed the wrong sort of leadership when he basically said about taxes, \u201cIt is almost entirely down to you whether you choose to pay it or not.\u201d Tax really is the responsibility of us all: it is a corporate responsibility and it is a personal responsibility.</p><p>Decades ago, when I was working in the corporate world, I remember the introduction of a thing called corporate social responsibility. It was a real buzz term, and we started making donations to charities, volunteering and so on. Of course, that is important and it is wonderful that big business does that, but we are seeing this almost replace tax responsibility. Rather than paying their way and supporting education, infrastructure and healthcare for society, we are seeing organisations perhaps decorate a community centre or go out on litter picks and the like.</p><p>Turning to personal tax avoidance, I have mentioned the former Chancellor, and there are schemes such as the film production scheme. Businesses have increasingly paid out dividends, substituting them for actual salary, because of course there is lower tax to be paid on dividends and it is advantageous to employees or directors to get a much larger proportion of their income through dividends. All we need to do is go to some of the ports around Europe, and see that the yachts in the berths there are all flying flags of convenience\u2014and they are all UK flags or those of UK overseas territories and Crown dependencies. There are no German flags, dare I say it, or Dutch flags or French flags. Either we are renowned for our sailing, or a lot of Germans or those of other nationalities like flying the British flag because\u2014I do not know\u2014they sail better or something like that. The same could be said about personal jets and where they are domiciled.</p><p>Let me just say that tax is good: it is a contribution to a better society, and we must think about what that society looks like. We should look at the words of Elizabeth Warren. Let me just paraphrase her; I will not do her justice. She basically said, \u201cWhy is it that people should simply want to avoid paying tax and then be able to afford to buy a Ferrari? There is no point in owning a Ferrari, if they have not got a good road to drive it on.\u201d People should pay their tax and get a Jaguar Land Rover or Aston Martin\u2014obviously, because they are much better products anyway\u2014and drive on a beautiful smooth road that has been paid for out of their taxes. That is the sort of society we should be looking for, not people avoiding tax, living behind gated communities, owning Lamborghinis, Ferraris or it whatever may be, and having roads full of potholes.</p><p>The Government need to turn up on this issue: they need to go Davos and places like that, and make the case for why international intervention and regulation need to be introduced. I agree with what the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills) said earlier about full disclosure. We need to see that across the entire business sector, whether for small businesses or large businesses. When we talk about consumers being given an informed choice, I think the consumer should know whether Caff\u00e8 Nero is not paying any tax at all, or whether Costa or one of the others is paying tax, and they can then make an informed decision. They can choose, saying, \u201cWell, maybe I want to buy my coffee from that place\u201d, or whatever the product or service may be.</p><p>I want to close on the issue of the tech titans. I say this to them: Amazon, you have your warehouses, and your warehouses need security. They need protection from fire; who is going to show up? Warwickshire fire and rescue service has had significant cuts, and it needs the money out of taxation to pay and provide for the fire and rescue services.</p><p>Nick Smith (Blaenau Gwent) (Lab)</p><p>It is estimated that five of the big tech companies paid an effective UK tax rate of just 2.9% in 2018. They avoided paying \u00a31.3 billion in taxes. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government need to get that money back?</p><p>Matt Western</p><p>Indeed they do, and I was just about to say in respect of companies such as Facebook that services impact on mental health. We need those services; they need to be paid for for our young people. I say to Apple and Google: your product upgrade and replacement cycles lead to huge waste in recycling. You have to pay your taxes; it is a responsibility that we deserve from you, to pay for our society.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3011542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y96-SKX1-F0YC-N23H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I am sure it has been an interesting past five years, to say the least.  Kaye opens his new book, Speech Police[2], with the story of imprisoned Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, and a reminder of just how much the internet has changed over the past decade. Derakhshan was a prolific and prominent blogger in 2008, influential and controversial enough within Iran that the government in Tehran charged him with 'spreading propaganda against the Islamic system' in 2008. By the time he was released in 2014, the decentralized internet on which he had made his name had largely morphed into the world of social media, on which everything is dominated by 'The Stream.' 'The Stream means you don't need to open so many websites anymore. </p><p>You don't need numerous tabs. You don't even need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you.' The industrialization of the internet was, perhaps, inevitable. But the consolidation and monopolization of American industry and economics, specifically, has left very few big companies to make a lot of very big decisions about our lives.  Uploading your thoughts and opinions to a personal blog or website on a more decentralized internet was a much different animal than arguing on Facebook\u2014in part because you were more responsible for the narrative and persona you constructed on the former, and because what you post on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter is more ethereal and quickly diluted in The Stream. That doesn't mean those posts don't have influence (as has been apparent in the many successful influence campaigns that have been mounted online, from the 2016 presidential election to the Brexit campaign), but that influence is more opaque, harder to track, and more susceptible to manipulation by those trying to sow division in society.  Online platforms have become wide-open spaces for public and private debate; hatred is spreading through them with the help of manufactured amplification; incitement of violence and discrimination seem to flow through their veins; and they have become highly successful and profitable zones for disinformation, election interference, and propaganda.  Big tech companies have long proclaimed that they are not media companies, and therefore not responsible for the content people post there. But they have become the 'gatekeepers to the news,' as Maria Ressa, founder of the news outlet Rappler in the Philippines, puts it. The newspapers and other news media outlets on which social media relies for so much of its source material used to act as that gatekeeper. There was no small amount of smug satisfaction and schadenfreude in comment sections online as they lost that lofty perch to Web 2.0 and the rise of citizen, amateur journalism online on one hand, and the loss of classified revenue to Craigslist on the other. But, rather than ultimately removing a layer of gatekeeping, the new version of the web adds a social media layer on top of the traditional news media, and mixes it all together with disinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories, memes, comments from real individuals and impersonators alike, and so much more. And, because of big tech's scale and power, their role has become even bigger than that of gatekeeper: Today's platform behemoths take it many steps further: They have become institutions of governance, complete with generalized rules and bureaucratic features of enforcement. They have struggled to figure out how to police content at the scale to which they've grown. Kaye reminds us of an era in which it seemed reasonable for Bill Clinton to announce of China's attempt to control the internet, 'Good luck! That's sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.' Well, China has not only done so for the most part, the authorities there are now using the internet in an attempt to control their people, as Amy Webb documents so well in The Big Nine[3]. In Syria, rights groups trying to capture the citizen-filmed footage documenting war crimes perpetrated by the government and groups like ISIS have found that such video is being removed as objectionable before they can get to it\u2014deleting the very film they may need to bring the perpetrators eventually to justice. This began as early as 2011, when footage uploaded to YouTube documenting thirteen-year-old Hamza al-Khatib's bruised, burned, and mutilated corpse sparked international outrage against the Syrian government he was protesting before being taken down (and eventually restored). But the practice of removing such citizen footage has accelerated since 2017, with little explanation or ability for human rights groups to recover it.  Meanwhile, in Myanmar, Facebook was largely seen as missing from action as a moderator when its platform was used to spread hate and incite violence against the Rohingya community. And in Kashmir, voices of dissent and those 'discussing threats they faced from the government' on Twitter were routinely noticing their tweets being deleted and accounts suspended without explanation or recourse. The mere mention of the political situation in Kashmir seemed enough to flag a post and get the user suspended. Three different dominant social media platforms, three different countries, and three very different policies all resulting in a stifling of human rights rather than their protection. The absence of a local voice in any of these instances, or real, on-the-ground engagement with and understanding of civil society in these places, creates a danger of 'digital colonialism,' and raises a serious question of whether the positive effects of providing a platform for freer speech in such places isn't outweighed by the abuse of it by those in power. Kaye contrasts the situations in Syria, Myanmar, and Kashmir to that in the European Union, where the strength of legal institutions allows individuals to challenge big tech, and 'enables individual agency in the face of corporate power.'  Europeans have tools to constrain not only the way the platforms collect and process personal data, but they have tools to constrain how the platforms govern public space. He also contrasts the realities faced within Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter when they were young, idiosyncratic upstarts in business trying to attract users with the responsibilities they now face having acquired billions of users 'in the process of maturing into major global institutions' and 'stewards of public space.' The ignorance and arrogance they demonstrated as young companies was unfortunate, but perhaps understandable. Now: Their decisions don't just have branding implications in the marketplace. They influence public space, public conversation, democratic choice, access to information, and perception of the freedom of expression. They have to acknowledge their unusual, perhaps unprecedented, roles as stewards of public space. Kaye was, at least in part, impressed by the seriousness and breadth he witnessed while sitting in on a content curation meeting at one company, believing the young professionals involved generally asked the right questions and were trying hard to get it right. Yet, he also noted that it 'cannot obscure the reality of the legislative role they play for billions of users, who themselves lack input into rule development.' He questions the platforms' increased reliance on AI moderators, largely hidden from and unaccountable to the public and not very well understood, which nevertheless seems to be making its way into government. Comments like Mark Zuckerberg's that Facebook does 'not want to be arbiters of truth' come in for even closer scrutiny. The simple fact is, Kaye insists, that nobody ever asked or wants them to be. They just want to be able to evaluate their data in order to determine answers to big questions concerning the public good, questions like: What is the impact of false information on platform users, the broader public, and public institutions? If the impact is appreciable and problematic, what should platform owners do to police this kind of content? What should governments do? Rather than a private company becoming the 'arbiter of truth,' an idea abhorrent to most, researchers simply want access to the treasure trove of information and data Facebook has in order to understand its impact on public life. Kaye discusses how we can curtail legitimately fake news without curtailing dissent, criticism, protest, and investigative journalism. He considers how, in places where Facebook can be the only alternative to state media and 'delete Facebook' isn't really an option, and neither is doing nothing. He explains how, currently, across the globe, the 'attempts at regulation are paradoxically increasing corporate power\u2014American corporate power\u2014to be in charge of vast swaths of global public forums.' There are other, and better ways.  He counsels the companies to move from a focus on legal liability to one of public obligation, sketching out ideas that can help both companies and governments police content. The companies should make human rights law the explicit standard underlying their content moderation and write that into their rules. They are global companies dominating public forums worldwide. International human rights law provides everyone with the right to seek, receive, and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. It protects everyone's right to hold opinions without interference. Just as important, human rights law gives companies a language to articulate their positions worldwide in ways that respect democratic norms and counter authoritarian demands. There is a sense that chaos and control are the two opposing options. Yet, we know how authoritarian attempts to control speech and individual expression in society generally devolve into chaos, and we've seen the current president of the United States sow chaos in order to control the news cycle and the daily attention of nearly everyone.  In physics, the second law of thermodynamics tells us the real choice is not between chaos and control, but between chaos and order. It states that, 'as one goes forward in time, the net entropy (degree of disorder) of any isolated or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same).' I can't think of a more compelling reason to keep the system as open as possible, to disentangle the concern for free speech and human rights from the economic interests of big tech companies, to remove the private power over and ostensible ownership of what is surely public speech online. Kaye argues for obeying the rules and standards of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights's Article 19 protection\u2014that 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'\u2014rather than 'the discretionary rules embedded in their terms of service.'  We don't need control, but order. We can turn for that order to standards already in place, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is time once again, as Eleanor Roosevelt said in a speech before the UN adopting the declaration in 1948, to \"rededicate ourselves to the unfinished task which lies before us.\" To combat the entropy occurring online\u2014one that currently seems destined toward chaos\u2014to govern speech on a global scale and determine the powerful role platform businesses are bound to have in the process, I can think of no better place to turn for that order than the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. At the end of the book, he points us to the several reports he has submitted to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 'on issues such as encryption and anonymity, content moderation, AI's impact on human rights, and other topics,' but the 144 pages of Speech Police[4] are a great place to start.

Parisians who have been cooped up for months with take-out food and coffee will be able to savor their steaks tartare in the fresh air and cobbled streets of the City of Light once more, albeit in smaller numbers. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are developments Tuesday related to the national and global response, the work place and the spread of the virus. ________________________ SPENDING: \u2014 With countries starting to loosen lockdown restrictions, many nations are beginning to show spending improvements, according to Visa. </p><p>Total U.S. payments volume dropped 5% in May from a year earlier. That's a 13 percentage point improvement from April. Debit grew 12% and credit declined 21% year-over-year in the period. That's a 17 percentage point and 9 percentage point improvement over April, respectively.  Visa said in a regulatory filing that the recovery in international markets in which it process the majority of transactions lagged the U.S. in May. Global processed transactions declined 12% last month, a 12 percentage point improvement over April.  BORROWING:  \u2014 Interest rates on U.S. new vehicle loans dropped to 4% on average last month, the lowest since 2013 as automakers offered 0% financing to juice sales. The Edmunds.com auto pricing site says the rate was the third-lowest since 2002. Loan lengths were near record highs in May with an average of 71.4 months, Edmunds reported. Used car rates averaged 8.3%, down from 8.7% a year ago but up more than a point from May of 2015. RETAILER RESULTS: \u2014 Sales at Lands' End fell 17.3% in the first quarter due to weakening demand caused by the virus outbreak. The retailer has taken several steps to cut costs and improve its financial flexibility, including implementing furloughs and temporarily reducing salaries for executives and corporate staff. Lands' End said it is cutting about 10% of its corporate staff in the second quarter.  For the second quarter, the company anticipates revenue declining in the mid to high single digits compared with a year ago. (Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! \u2014 Dick's Sporting Goods swung to a loss in the first quarter and sales declined, but the sporting goods retailer is seeing sales improve as stores reopen. While consolidated same-store sales fell 29.5% in the first quarter, they are only down 4% through the first four weeks of the second quarter. Online sales remain strong, as consumers look to remain fit during lockdown. The chain's e-commerce sales, which include curbside contactless pickup, increased 110% in the first quarter. Following Dick's temporary store closures through the end of the first quarter, e-commerce sales rose 210%. \u2014 Build-A-Bear moved to a loss in its fiscal first quarter, according to preliminary results, with sales falling 45%. The company is starting to reopen some stores, but says it expects to continue with tight inventory management, preserving cash and a reduced staff as it works its way through the virus outbreak. It anticipates having approximately 35 stores open by the end of this week, with more opening over the coming weeks. The plush toy company did experience a surge in online orders, particularly for its stuffed animal based on 'the Child' from the Disney+ series, 'The Mandalorian.\" Build-A-Bear said Tuesday that it had its highest single day demand in its online history with the initial offering of the product.  \u2014 Sally Beauty Holdings is seeing a strong uptick in sales at reopened stores. The company estimates May's enterprise-wide sales at $262 million, compared with $95 million in April.  Sally Beauty had 37% of its stores open in the U.S. and Canada in early May, but has 84% open as of Tuesday. All furloughed workers in the field and at headquarters in the U.S. and Canada have been recalled by the company, effective on Monday, except for associates working in the limited number of stores that remain closed. Additional associates in Europe and Latin America will return in the company's fourth quarter. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS &amp;#38; BANKS: France's government says its recession will be even deeper this year than earlier thought. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on RTL radio Tuesday that the government now forecasts the French economy - one of the world's largest - will shrink by 11% this year instead of earlier estimates of 8%. That will be France's worst economic performance since World War II. \u2014 The Czech economy has been on the decline in the first quarter of 2020 amid the pandemic. Figures released from the Czech Statistics Office on Tuesday show that the Czech economy contracted by 3.3% in the first three months of the year compared with the previous three months, and by 2% year-over-year. It's the biggest decline since 2010, and the economy is expected to contract even more in the second quarter. MARKETS: U.S. stock indexes are moving higher Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of lockdown mandates will put economies on the path to recovery. UNPAID LEAVE: Starbucks is encouraging employees to take unpaid leave through the end of September. In a letter sent to employees late last month, Starbucks U.S. President Rossann Williams said employees on leave will be able to keep their benefits and may also apply for unemployment aid. The company has reopened 85% of U.S. stores, but hours are limited and dining areas remain closed.7 Boring Stocks That Are Winners[1]Some stocks just don't get much attention during bull markets. They can be too boring for a growth portfolio. But when the market is going through a period of volatility and uncertainty, these tried-and-true performers have a way of making their way back to popularity. And there are good reasons for this. First, many of these boring stocks pay dividends. This simply means that the company will reward shareholders simply for holding on to its stock. Dividend stocks aren't designed to make you rich quickly. However they are designed to offer investors an amount of predictability. And we could all use a little bit of that right now. And predictable stocks can also help investors manage risk. It can be fun to invest in speculative stocks. But they include a risk premium. When these stocks go up (as they sometimes do) they usually have a return that exceeds the broader market. But when they go down (and they usually do) they usually go down more than the broader market. But 'boring' stocks tend to move closer to the broader market. If you want an analogy from current events, these stocks flatten the curve. They won't soar as high as riskier stocks, but they won't sink as low either. And right now, preserving capital should be the number one item on every investor's checklist. With that in mind, we've created this special presentation to highlight 7 conservative stocks that can help investors win this moment in time. Many of them pay dividends; some do not. But they all have solid fundamental reasons to own them now. View the \"7 Boring Stocks That Are Winners\"[2].

MERRITT, VP, IR, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: All right. Welcome to S&amp;P Global Investor Day. I want to thank those of you on the -- for attending here today, for those of you on the webcast, but particularly some of you folks traveled from quite a distance. We've got folks from California and Canada, Z\u00c3\u00bcrich, 6 folks from London, but the award goes to Marcus Guzzardi from Australia. So thanks for that. That's a true shareowner right there. I've done a number of Investor Days, and there's basically 2 principal complaints you get afterwards. The #1 complaint after Investor Day is that the humble, hard-working IR guy doesn't get enough stage time. So that -- we're not going to fix that today. So -- but the other complaint is not enough time for question and answers. So you're going to get plenty of chances today to ask the speakers questions.</p><p>So as always, I need to read the obligatory statements. So first our non-GAAP adjusted information. In today's press release and throughout Investor Day, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. And then -- click ahead here. And of course, we get the safe harbor. In addition, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about the forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed today will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic filings filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Okay. So with that, let's introduce what's going to occur today. We'll start off today with opening remarks from Doug Peterson, our President and CEO, who'll talk about strategy. We'll go to Mike Chinn after that to talk about Market Intelligence. Martina Cheung will talk about ESG. Ewout and I were in Europe last week, and I don't think there was a meeting we had where there wasn't an ESG question, so for you Americans, it's coming. And then Martin Fraenkel for Platts. At that time, we're going to have a Q&amp;A. That Q&amp;A will be specifically just for Mike, Martina and Martin, okay? You'll get Doug later. After the Q&amp;A, we'll have a refreshment break, get a chance to go outside, where you've got your lunch, take a quick break. We'll come back in, we'll pick up with Alex Matturri from Index, John Berisford from Ratings. Then we've got a technology panel. So Mike's going to come back up and host a little panel with Nick Cafferillo, our Chief Investment -- our Chief Technology Officer, and Daniel Nadler, Kensho's Founder and CEO. We'll then have another Q&amp;A. At that Q&amp;A, it will simply be for Alex, John and the panel members, okay? Then we'll have our final speaker, Ewout Steenbergen. Then we'll have the last Q&amp;A, which will be Doug and Ewout and our 4 presidents, okay? So plenty of chances for questions.</p><p>Now I hope that most of you had a chance to see the showcase. If not, after the presentations, there will be a cocktail reception and an opportunity to go see the showcases that you didn't see. Ratings 360, you've heard us talk a lot about that, please go visit that booth. FactorAllocator, you probably don't know anything about it, worth visiting. We talked about the Market Intelligence platform, right. That's something that Mike and his team are putting together. There's 3 examples of it for you out there from 3 different persona groups. Data feeds, very interesting data -- as a unique way of using data feeds. Platts has something about Blockchain with Fujairah, we've talked about it on our conference calls. You can kind of see it as live as you can see something in technology. And then at Davos, at the World Economic Forum, we had a panel, a huge wall. And we've kind of made a version of that here for -- about The Big Picture on Energy. And lastly, we made the Kensho acquisition, and there's a chance to go out there and talk to folks who can answer things that I can't. So please, take the time, ask them the tough questions that just go right over my head. So with that, let's start the day with Doug Peterson.</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: Thank you, Chip, and good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. It's great to be here. I want to welcome you to New York to our Investor Day. It's been a few years since we've had an Investor Day. As you know, we've been interacting with you through our quarterly earnings calls and visits around the globe. But over those few years, we've been having really strong performance. Our company has delivered strong returns. We've delivered margin improvements. We've been able to raise our market cap. But there's challenges around us. We still see, around us, various challenges. Our customer expectations have changed dramatically. There's a disruption around us from technology, changing every kind of business model you can imagine. And the macroeconomic environment has changed. This morning, I went to CNBC to talk for a few minutes, and I thought I was going to get bumped because of one of those macroeconomic and geopolitical issues which relates to North Korea.</p><p>But throughout that, we've actually had 150 years of dealing with disruption and change. Our roots in this company go back to the original Mr. Poor, Henry Varnum Poor, that launched reports on railroads and canals. And over those last 150 years, we've developed products and services to deliver intelligence and products and data that our customers use to make decisions. And they asked the question, what does S&amp;P think? What does S&amp;P Global think before they make decisions? And so today, we're going to talk a little bit about the past. We're going to talk a little bit about our performance, but we're also going to give you a vision for the future and how we're going to position ourselves for growth to return more for our shareholders. Over the last 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, we've transformed this company. And if you remember, 4 years ago, when we had our last Investor Day, we had just completed a transformation of McGraw-Hill and turned it into a data and analytics company focused on financial markets. And when we took this strategy and took a step back, I thought about the company in different ways. We were global and the types of products and services that we could provide that would have the most impact would be global. We were going to build scale businesses. We were going to have strong brands, and our data and our analytics and our benchmarks were going to be entirely focused on markets, financial markets and commodity markets. So during that time, we divested of noncore businesses, we did acquisitions. One of the most important was acquiring SNL. And as you've seen, SNL has been transformative for us. We've put together the Market Intelligence division. SNL now forms a core part of our company when it comes to technology and data operations. And also during this time, we've invested in risk and control and compliance to have that foundation. So we've invested to have a strong foundation. And what were some of the results you saw? You saw the margins go from 30% to 47% over that 6-year period. And our revenues increased last year to $6.1 billion. Our total shareholder return on the prior 3 years, the CAGR, was 26% from 2015 to 2017 versus 11% for the S&amp;P 500. But one of the things that unified all of us across that platform was the brand, the S&amp;P Global brand. Something that brought the company together, gave us a single purpose and allowed us to have all of our employees and all of our services to have this intense focus on essential intelligence. So our ratings business, which provides opinions to global markets and local markets. Market Intelligence serving investors, risk managers investment bankers with models, with data, with analytics. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, that is the benchmark. When people ask, how did the market do? People answer with either S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones. And Platts, S&amp;P Global Platts, which is embedded across the energy complex. But you might ask, who are we? Who is our company? Our 20,000 employees in 31 countries. We have over 200 billion data points across all of our different platforms. We serve 97 of the top 100 global Fortune 100 companies. And we serve 10 of the top 10 global banks. And you think about these customers, over the last year, I've spent a lot of time with customers. It's one of the things that I enjoy in my job, getting out into the markets, meeting with different people who are making decisions, who are using our data and analytics. Last year, when I met with the Treasurer of Boeing, we talked about their competitive dynamics and how they think about the markets. We talked about their supply chain, and we talked about how they raise financing for a very complex global aviation industry. And we talked about Cap IQ and how Cap IQ is integral to all of their decision-making on the industry dynamics. We talked about how they were using our rating services with a new structured finance approach to raising aircraft financing for the emerging markets. Earlier this year, I was in San Francisco, I met with the CEO and the CFO of Salesforce. I learned a lot from them about their business model, because we're spending a lot of time understanding technology. But they also were taking a trip their first time to tap the public markets for debt and appreciative of having S&amp;P Global Ratings along with them. Early this year, I was in Japan, meeting with GPIF, which is the largest pool of assets under management anywhere in the world. And as Chip just said, the ESG and sustainability focus was the main part of our conversation. And they are using our index business to help them shape new indices and benchmarks for their performance. And finally, at the end of the year last year, I was in Mexico, meeting with the CEO and CFO of Pemex. And as you know, Pemex is looking at how the oil markets and gas markets are transforming from shale as well as all of the production dynamics in the Gulf in the Southwestern part of the United States. And we talked about that and how they use the Platts benchmarks and the Platts data to make their investment decisions.</p><p>And as our customers are adapting to change, so are we. It's necessary that despite having 150 years of performance and especially the last 5 years, 3 years, with very strong performance, we can't be complacent. We have to be cognizant that the world is changing around us. Now more than ever, we have to understand what is happening that's shaping the environment. AI and machine learning, the millennials. In fact, 64% of our employees are millennials, and they have different expectations on how they're going to work. And the regulatory landscape has been changing. But very importantly, customer insights are changing, customer needs are changing. So last year, despite having had a very strong track record, we took a step back and said, let's revisit our strategy, let's revisit our vision. We're not going to change our purpose. We're not going to change the foundation of what we are. We're not going to let go of the things we're doing well, but let's see how we're going to approach the future. So we took 60 of our top employees along with our operating committee, we formed 8 teams. Those teams went out and met with 155 companies. These teams focused on 5 client segments, including investment banking, commercial banking, governments, corporates. We had 3 teams, one of them looked at competition, one at disruption, one at technology. And for almost 3 months, we spent time understanding all of those insights and what the implications were for us. And what did we learn? We learned that customers' expectations are changing. When customers and users end up at the office, their experience is very different at their desktop than what it is on their cell phones. And when they're arriving at office and the way that new products and services are integrated, delivery is different, the graphication, the visualization tools, the color, the interactivity. They also have a demand for transparency. And very importantly, around the globe, we hear that there's new data sets when it comes to ESG in particular as well as supply chain data, private company information that there's increasing demand for. So with that, we developed a strategy called Powering the Markets of the Future. Based off of the customer feedback, these insights, views on competition and disruption, the future of the markets, but based on our own employees' insights and how we did that as a team, and you can imagine the kind of excitement that that's created across the company that our own employees could go out and meet these hundreds of customers and develop our own strategy. And as part of that, we've developed a framework. This framework is what we're going to use today throughout the presentations. This is what we're going to be using for the next few years to guide our investments, to guide how we're going to grow the company.</p><p>And this has a couple of different approaches. First, we're going to use this to serve our customers better, to anticipate their needs and meet their needs. We're also going to use it to serve our own people better, to serve our shareholders. And this framework has 3 elements to it. It has an approach to evolving and growing our core businesses, finding adjacencies in places that we can invest for the future that cut across S&amp;P Global or they're new needs we can go out and fulfill. And then we have foundational capabilities, being global, customer-oriented, innovation, technology, operational excellence and our people. Our commitment to our people to ensure that we continue to invest in mentoring and leadership training, managing our people better. And one of the areas that we've looked at specifically, recently, is technology training, in a program called essential tech, something that we've rolled out across the company, starting with me, starting with the operating committee, so we ourselves can become much more savvy about technology, especially since we're going to be investing so much there.</p><p>Now going back to what I mentioned earlier about listening to our customers. Over the last 5, 6, 7 years, especially starting in Europe and especially starting in Northern Europe, we've been hearing this need to start bringing more ESG information to the markets, environmental social and governance data analytics, benchmarks, different ways that investors, risk managers, corporations, governments can make decisions incorporating this kind of information. So as part of that, we've undertaken an approach, and you're going to hear more about it, on how we can take some of the products and services we already have but understand what those needs are. As an example today, there's over 9,000 companies reporting some type of ESG information, and through TruCost, we're actually gathering that in one of our products and services. 1,700 companies have already signed the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing (sic) [Investment], including ourselves. And so you're going to be hearing more about the design team and what they're doing. But also, ESG is something that we've taken seriously ourselves, and we've invested in ESG as S&amp;P Global. Our energy use is down by 27% over the last 5 years in our offices. We have a carbon offset program for our travel. In the S space, last year, we donated 40,000 hours of our employees' time to community activities. Earlier this year, as you know, we invested $20 million in our foundation, and we're an industry leader when it comes to employee resource groups that provide our diversity programs a really unique way to connect our employees. And as you also know, over the last 5 years, we've refreshed and diversified our Board of Directors, who really provide an excellent oversight and strong governance.</p><p>Now as you know, technology and innovation is going to have to be part of our future, part of everyone's future. And when we envisioned our strategy and we thought about the future, we didn't see one that technology wasn't going to be integral to it. In fact, we had a lot of arguments as, how much are machines going to be taking over decision-making, what is going to be the relationship between human decision-making and machine decision-making. And we felt like this was so important for us that we had to really raise our game in technology. So over the last few years, we have been investing in technology already through S&amp;P Global Ventures, through relationships with venture capital firms in San Francisco, in Singapore and Tel Aviv, in direct investments that we've been making ourselves. We also knew that we had to commit to have platform, to the S&amp;P Global platform, which we've been developing and you'll hear more about this morning. And we acquired Panjiva, which is providing data sciences. It has a advanced data supply and data science capabilities. When you go back to the showcases, you can see some of the Panjiva data incorporated in some of our products. And with Kensho, who you're also going to be hearing more from this -- or this afternoon, you're going to see that Kensho has brought an incredibly, what we call, extension of our brains, a way to extend our intelligence and make what was essential intelligence even more essential and more important. We have some early wins that you're going to hear about with our Crunchbase data of private companies, which was incorporated in hours and a few weeks of planning as opposed to months and months. So technology is something that doesn't happen by accident. You need to take it on proactively to ensure that you can become successful. And one of the ways we've thought about it at the company is to think about, how are we going to manage the company as well. And we've -- last year, after understanding what the demands were in the markets, what's -- what our needs were to be more technologically savvy, we developed a program, where we now have operational services across S&amp;P Global, where we've unified our digital infrastructure, our engineering and technology and innovation services as well as our data operation services. And this gives us a platform to have scale, agility, apply Agile approaches and have best-in-class and speed in how we deliver. Now putting all this together, during today, you're going to be hearing from our executives about our future, about this framework on how we're going to evolve our core businesses, pursue adjacent opportunities, develop our foundational capabilities and how we're positioning S&amp;P Global, starting with strategy that's already been very successful: Being global, having scale, strong brands, serving markets and how we're going to use this approach to provide our future. And we're going to have the ability today to give you a vision for that future, a commitment to our employees, a commitment to the markets, how we're going to deliver growth, how we're not being complacent about what we see happening around us, a commitment to our shareholders and how we're going to continue to deliver. With that, I want to hand it over to Mike Chinn, and thank all of you and welcome you for being with us this afternoon. Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN, PRESIDENT OF S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE AND EXECUTIVE VP OF DATA &amp; TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: Good afternoon, everybody. I am delighted to be here with you to share the Market Intelligence story, to share our goals and our aspirations and our visions for the market for the Intelligence business and show you how our strategy connects to the broader S&amp;P Global strategy that Doug just shared with you today. We are -- believe that in a world that is awash in data, where data is providing every day the fuel for decision-making in the 21st century, we believe that we are very well positioned to take advantage of a multitude of opportunities that, that environment creates, to help our customers drive better decision-making and faster decision-making and to continue to deliver above-market revenue growth and ongoing creation of shareholder value. Doug showed you this framework that we're all going to use today to talk to you about our businesses, in particular around the foundational capabilities. I'm going to focus in on 4 of those. I'm going to talk about how we continue to evolve the way that we engage with our customers, get -- orient ourselves so that we can most effectively understand their challenges and their problems and help them design solutions to solve those problems. We'll talk -- I'll talk about how we have opportunities to be -- continue to become a much more global business in every respect and maybe most importantly, how we are going to continue to harness and invest in technology to drive innovative solutions and grow our business over the long term. We think that by doing all of those things successfully, harnessing all of those capabilities, that we can help our customers make better, faster and smarter decisions, with greater conviction than they ever have before. When we think about the Market Intelligence business, we have assembled an amazing array of content and data assets, great brands that we've assembled over many years that serve as the foundation for everything that we do. We focus on differentiated content, unique content, that has an incredibly high degree of quality and relevance, all sorts of business and financial data that serves as the bedrock for our business. On top of that, we've developed excellent technological capabilities and skills, software engineering that allows us to build workflow tools atop that content and help our clients get to the answer quicker.</p><p>And then the third key ingredient for us is that we have a proactive, knowledgeable, customer-facing commercial and go-to-market organization, so that we cannot only design products that help our customers, but sell those successfully and help our clients maximize the value that they get from those products. We do this with over 10,000 colleagues around the world in over 40 offices, including significant operation centers and delivery centers in areas all over the world, where there's a strong alignment of culture and of what we're trying to achieve really around the world. We have over 230,000 active users of our platforms today, and we cover over 4 million companies across those databases. As we look at the last couple of years, we've delivered very strong top line growth -- organic growth, and what you'll notice here is that, that growth is very consistent across all 3 product categories that we produce. Our desktop business may be the most familiar, a host of great brands where we deliver our content through Excel and Mobile and web experiences. Our Risk Services business, where we monetize the intellectual property that comes from the ratings agency, and then supplement that with new solutions that look at the unrated universe and help our clients understand credit and model out credit risk. And then our Data Management Solutions, where we directly feed all of that rich content into the internal systems of our customers. And you can see that across-the-board quite consistent growth, around 9% over the last couple of years. At the same time that we've been growing, we have made really good headway on the margin front, since the acquisition of SNL and the integration of those 2 businesses. You can see that margins have grown almost 900 basis points. About half of that is due to delivering the SNL-related synergies in a greater quantity and faster than we thought at the time of closing of the deal. We've also done a lot of work to streamline processes, leadership structure, tools and products. And then there also, of course, is inherent operating leverage in our business, in our heavily subscription-based business. And so those 3 big areas together have enabled us to grow our margins impressively over the last couple of years. As we look at the overall environment in which we operate, market growth, the financial data and analytics business is growing about 3% to 4%. So there's strong baseline growth. There is, of course, a growing demand for tools and software solutions that help our customers do things faster, do it more efficiently, cut costs, automate things, and just generally create greater productivity and greater insights. So we have the wind at our back there too. We also think that regulation on balance is modestly constructive for our business. As regulations change, as the environment for the companies that we serve change, they often turn to us to help them comply with new regulations. MiFID II is a small impact for us, because we just don't have a lot of exposure to that ecosystem around broker research. And so for us, that's not a significant impact for us. And then around Market Intelligence specifically, we have great revenue visibility. Over 95% of our revenue comes from subscription-based products, and our renewal rates are around 95%. So the combination of those 2 things provides us with a lot of ballast and a lot of consistency going forward. If you look at the chart on the right, you'll see that we are still heavily indexed to North America with respect to our revenue. And while the areas in EMEA and APAC are growing faster, we know that we have opportunities to add fuel to the fire and grow faster outside of the U.S. And then lastly, we also have great diversity in our revenue streams, not only by product group, but also by the segments that we serve and the personas that we serve within those customer segments. And so I want to give you a sense for the breadth and the depth and the size of those -- of that diversity of segments.</p><p>If you look here on the left side, you'll see that we do serve a lot of segments, and I think this is, to some degree, unique and interesting around the Market Intelligence franchise in relation to some of our peers in the market. Investment banking and investment management continue to be and will always be important segments for us, and those comprise a little less than 50% of our revenue. But I'll point you to the last few blocks in that chart on the left, and you'll see that private equity, commercial banking and insurance, nonfinancial corporations and then other companies, which include professional services firms of all stripes, consulting, accounting and law firms, government and regulatory agencies, that's more than 50% of our revenue.</p><p>And what you'll -- we think that is interesting for a couple of reasons. Doug referenced a 360-degree view of the market. We think that by engaging deeply with all of these segments, we actually can build products and then monetize them across, but also bring new insights that we may learn in one segment to another segment, and we think that is unique about our franchise. You'll also notice that all 4 of those segments are growing faster than Market Intelligence overall. There is tremendous change going on in the corporate world, and we have deep, deep relationships from which we can springboard. To just to give you a sense for what that looks like, we took one of our clients, a large commercial bank, and are showing you the depth and breadth of our relationship there. We have over 600 users at this commercial bank, and certain segments would be very familiar to you in finance, capital markets, credit risk, where we have very strong assets, but you can also see that we have strong penetration in revenue-producing parts of these commercial banks: retail lending, commercial lending, leveraged and sponsored finance. So not only are these deep relationships, but they're broad, they continue to grow. And you can also see that from a product perspective, this isn't just a one-trick pony with SNL content or Cap IQ content, we also have very strong product diversification within these accounts. So we think this is an interesting part of our business, maybe not terribly well understood, but you can see that it is really feeling our growth and fueling the way that we help our customers. So now let's turn to another part of our business that we're very excited about. Data Management solutions, for us, is our data feeds and API business. In some way, this is the purest part of what a content and data and analytics company does. We -- it takes advantage of our tremendous capabilities in sourcing and integrating and cleaning and synthesizing data of all stripes and then feeding that directly into the systems of our end users. This is about 20% of our business today, and you can see on the left that it also is growing faster than Market Intelligence overall. And we think this just has tremendous potential. As our clients continue to get more and more sophisticated with technology, they are coming to us for content to fuel all of those processes, risk processes, revenue-producing processes and a whole series of other use cases.</p><p>We thought to illustrate this, we would show you 1 example of our experience with 1 quant hedge fund client over the last 18 months. And what you'll notice here is that we started off with a very modest contract, $12,000, where we were feeding them PDF files of our transcripts. But as over time, we made that machine-readable, we made it streaming in real time and most importantly, we tagged those transcripts with everyone who spoke in those transcripts, with all the analysts who asked questions in those transcripts, with an understanding of ownership data of those companies. And by increasing the amount of linking and integration and making that available so that our end quant fund customer could actually understand what did it mean when this analyst asked that question, what kind of estimates did they have on this company, you can see that we actually create not just linear value, but we create exponential value for the end customer. And by doing all of that heavy lifting upfront for them, we save them tremendous time and let them focus on insight generation. Typical data scientist or machine learning expert may spend 80% of their time cleaning and integrating and synthesizing data. And by doing this for them, we believe that we create exponential value.</p><p>And this isn't just a hedge fund opportunity for us. We are -- as the world continues to change and data is increasingly the fuel for decision-making, we see that commercial underwriting teams, insurance underwriting teams and data lakes and data scientists among our customer base continue to demand this content for us. So this is an area where we're investing not only in the infrastructure, but in our commercial capabilities.</p><p>So given that we've got this fairly broad product suite and a number of different products, how do we actually get out to the market and engage with our customers? We have spent a lot of time over the last couple of years retooling and reorganizing our entire commercial team, with the goal of making things simple and easy for our customers to engage with us, to buy from us, to be trained by us and ultimately, for us to deliver more value for them. We also have structured ourselves so that we can create much deeper relationships, not just transactional relationships around sales and invoices, but much deeper relationships, where we can bring to bear the full capabilities of our firm and help them create new insights from the information that we provide. Fundamentally, we did 2 things. We had to get organized and aligned, and we had to make things simple. So for instance, we have about 800 people in our commercial organization. Every one of them focuses only on one of those segments that we serve, because we believe we need to be as expert in our client businesses as they are, and the best way to do that is to focus in on 1 segment. We also created role clarity. We have new salespeople, we have relationship managers and we have product specialists, or sales engineers. And we've got the right incentives in place for all of those, so that we can not only drive whitespace production or new logos, but we can build much deeper relationships with our existing customers. We also knew that we needed to simplify and make it easy and reduce friction for our customers to interact with us. We reduced our product packages by 90%. We've also moved about 70% of our legacy per-seat contracts to enterprise agreements. And the reason that we like enterprise agreements is it creates greater stickiness, it reduces the friction for our -- for any client, any end user to get value from our product, and we think that it's just a much better arrangement all the way around and creates a much deeper relationship. So this is what we spent a couple of years doing, and we're starting to see results. We've got some very strong leading indicators that tell us that this is starting to make an impact. Our renewal rates have improved from the low 90s to 95%, which is indicative of deeper, more insightful, and we're bringing more value to these relationships. We're also starting to see that new logo generation, where we are actually bringing new customers into the Market Intelligence fold, have increased dramatically. Our relationship managers are delivering more referrals, which tells us they're actually getting in and understanding what problems we can help our customers solve. And as a result, we're seeing very strong user growth of about 14% year-on-year. And we think we'll monetize that over the long term through higher renewal rates, stickier relationships, better pricing and also, more willing referrals. And then also, more -- on a more qualitative basis, we've reduced the administrative burden by simplifying everything on our frontline salespeople by about 10%. And as a result, all of these things have helped fuel that strong organic growth that we looked at a few minutes ago.</p><p>So now that we've gotten our commercial model a little more dialed in, it's really important that we equip all of our commercial folks with the right technology and the right products to get out to the market. So the S&amp;P Global platform Doug mentioned, this is the largest software engineering project underway at S&amp;P. Fundamentally, what we're trying to do here is to bring together all of our legacy platforms into 1 consistent user experience that's simple and integrated. This will allow our clients to interact with us very consistently across every channel, Excel, web, mobile, feeds even, but this is a big project for us. And you can see here that this is a project that will be a multi-year journey, not only for us, but also for our end customers, because we have about 230,000 of them to move to this new platform. We took the first steps in doing this with the SNL platform over the last few months. We've heard a lot of feedback from a lot of our end customers who are very accustomed to the systems that we have. And in response to that feedback, we've stepped up our release cycle so that we can be more responsive and address the feedback that's coming in. We've done 4 subsequent releases since last November, and we've moved about 100,000 users to the new platform. The Cap IQ platform is under development. This will take 2 or 3 years. We want to be very deliberate, very thoughtful and cognizant of the fact that we are changing deeply embedded work tools, and we have the luxury of taking the long view on this. And then there are some other products that we need to move. At the same time, the Market Intelligence platform has also become truly the S&amp;P Global platform. If you had a chance in the showcase to look at Ratings 360, Ratings 360 is launching in the next week or so, and it is built on the architecture and infrastructure of the new Market Intelligence platform. RatingsDirect will move to that, and then our colleagues in Platts -- and Martin will talk about this in a bit -- also will be able to build upon this architecture. We think this helps everyone at S&amp;P Global get to market more efficiently and quicker than we would if we were all doing this independently on our own, and we think that is a big win for S&amp;P Global.</p><p>So now looking forward a little bit. We think we have a multitude of opportunities to build off of this very robust and strong foundation. We've grouped them into 3 buckets, these opportunities. The first, we think there are some very logical and yet material extensions of our core data and analytics franchise. In our Risk Services business, and you'll hear from Martina in a little bit, there are opportunities for us to expand our ESG coverage, to expand our cyber risk coverage to make sure that we're providing a holistic view of risk and credit risk to our customers. We also are experimenting in doing research on behavioral and sentiment-based models, so that moving beyond just pure financial credit risk, but also taking in the totality of information that's available in the market today. And we also are responsive in taking advantage of new regulations. IFRS 9, CECL and other things that are changing the way that companies need to evaluate their credit risk, and we are really well positioned to deliver solutions and have one of our showcases focused on that. Similarly, we think there are ways to continue and opportunities to continue to expand our core competencies around differentiated and unique content. Doug referenced Panjiva, which is a really innovative company doing interesting things around supply chain data and trade flow data. We think that supply chain presents a nice opportunity for us going forward. We also have opportunities to round out where we are already very deep in certain sectors, opportunities to round out global coverage. And we also are really interested in continuing to expand our sector-specific, sector-relevant model to sectors that we do not follow today. And we've done some pretty extensive research to identify opportunities that we think are ripe for our style of coverage and our approach to the market.</p><p>Second big group, and I mentioned this earlier, is that we know that we have bigger opportunities outside of North America than we've taken advantage of so far. Some of this is just building out our commercial teams. We've identified areas to supplement those teams in fast-growing, emerging markets. And in Risk Services in particular, given the relative immaturity of certain markets around the world in emerging economies, we bring a particular product set and skill set to helping commercial banks and insurance companies evaluate all sorts of asset class risk with some of our scorecard solutions. We also have opportunities and the need to make our products more relevant in some of these markets. Some things are as straightforward as product localization, making sure that our products are easily used by the full scope of users in some of these countries. Private company data, Doug mentioned, is a big opportunity for us. We've prioritized key markets, where we think we have a real ability to build solutions off of private companies and provide greater detail and context there. And then the last part of that is, in certain countries where financial data is either less available or less reliable, we've done some very interesting work to start to build alternative credit models that look at non-financial data, where traditional data is limited. And then the third bucket and last bucket of opportunities that I'll talk about today is embracing the tremendous opportunities that have been created by the proliferation of new sources of content outside of traditional data and new technologies. And we think about these in 2 ways. First is non-traditional or alternative data, as it's often called. We are already doing this. In many areas, there is a great showcase around using transcripts and linking that together with other content, I referenced that a little bit ago. But we believe, as I said earlier, that linking this alternative data, geographic data, satellite data, logistics data, other things, together with our traditional data creates exponential value. It also leverages some of our strong suits and some of our core competencies around sourcing, ingesting and integrating content, and we'll talk about this later. And again, as I mentioned earlier, this is not just a quant hedge fund opportunity for us. We see these opportunities across the multitude of segments that we serve.</p><p>And then on the emerging technology side. We think we have a big opportunity to improve discoverability and usability of our platforms by incorporating a much more natural language, Google-like search into our products to help our customers get to the answer faster and find what they're looking for more efficiently. And then machine learning also accelerates for us time-to-market. We've talked about Crunchbase, something that would have taken us months has been distilled down to hours or days to get out to market quicker. And so this whole area is a great opportunity for us to marry together our core data capabilities with capabilities around emerging technologies.</p><p>So just to close here. We think that over the last couple of years, we've been the fastest-growing organic -- fastest organic grower in our space. We would hope to continue to do that, given the huge spectrum of possibilities and opportunities that we have.</p><p>And we'll continue to focus on 3 things: the first is, leveraging our strong content heritage, building off of this robust foundation of unique assets and must-have content to expand our core franchise. The second is, we have big opportunities to streamline and enrich the customer experience. The S&amp;P Global platform is one part of that, but there are a number of things that we need to do and opportunities we have there across all of our delivery platforms.</p><p>And then, as I just mentioned, we are very well positioned to harness the proliferation of data from all sorts of new sources and use emerging technologies like Kensho and others to integrate alternative data into our products and build new things that the market hasn't seen before.</p><p>So I'll close there. Thank you very much, and I'd like to introduce Martina Cheung.</p><p>MARTINA L. CHEUNG, HEAD OF GLOBAL RISK SERVICES, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. It's my first time meeting many of you, and I'm really delighted to be here today so I can talk to you a little about our ESG initiative at S&amp;P Global. I didn't want to make any assumptions around how deeply all of you were familiar with ESG, so I thought it would be good to maybe start from a fairly foundational level in terms of how we think about ESG at S&amp;P Global.</p><p>So we view ESG as critical to long-term value creation. And that's not just for companies. It's for investors and a lot of other stakeholders in the market. Some of the top factors driving this value creation, for example, under environmental, think about factors such as greenhouse gases -- greenhouse gas reduction, rather, resource consumption; under the social category you can think about factors such as labor standards, such as product quality and safety, and under the governance area, think about remuneration, board composition and policies as well as shareholder rights.</p><p>And of course, all of these things have the ability to impact both your top and bottom line. So rather than just thinking about it from the standpoint of reporting and disclosure requirements, we could look at, for example, your ability to manage operational risk. If you think about disruption, possible in your supply chain as a result of ESG impacts. If you think about also the ability to manage your costs, for instance, through more efficient energy consumption.</p><p>We also look at the ability to really differentiate your brand and increase retention and loyalty with your employees through strong ESG programs. We're also seeing the use of a lot of what we think of as upside ESG strategies. So for example, if you are a big tech company and you decide to power your data center through solar, you may be able to sell your excess power back to the grid at a profit, and that's a great example of an ESG upside strategy. And so, when you think about all these things together, it can impact cash flow, profits and, ultimately, long-term company value.</p><p>Of course, we're not alone in thinking like this. By any measure, this market has experienced exceptional growth in the last several years. Doug mentioned that there are over 9,000 companies reporting ESG today. That's up from about 20 companies in the early '90s. When you think about the 1,700 signatories of the UN PRI, their asset under management has effectively grown by 11x between 2006 and 2017. And today, globally, there are around $23 trillion assets that are managed under responsible investing strategies. And that's an increase of about 25% since 2014.</p><p>So a very fast-growing market and lots of adoption in that market. And when we see the adoption in a market that's fairly young and nascent, we also see the customer needs start to increase.</p><p>Now I want to just make sure to emphasize to you, a lot of you might think about the ESG's case as being very much sort of driven by the investors, and certainly, that's been an area where there has been a lot of focus in the last several years. But for us, ESG actually has broad application across the many use cases and users that we have across all of our divisions. So certain of the investors would use ESG for exclusionary screening. Some of you may already do that. You'll see a lot of ESG investment themes, for example. But we also serve lenders who are interested in ESG linked in lending, and you may also need ESG factors to actually track loan covenants, for example.</p><p>In addition to that, I mentioned operational risk. A supply chain manager may have operational risk exposure if their counterparties in the supply chain have poor labor standards and have strikes and disruptions, for example.</p><p>And then last but not least, think about the CFO. Not only do they have oftentimes the burden of compliance or regulatory disclosures, but they're also responsible for actually being able to calculate the financial impact of these ESG factors for reporting purposes.</p><p>Now when we talk to all of those customers and all of those users of ESG information, what they tell us is that they're experiencing quite a bit of pain in terms of how they do their analysis. And this comes down into several areas. The first will be around data.</p><p>So it's not just enough to have the ESG score. Our users and our customers want the underlying data that goes under that score, and they want to know that so they can run their own analysis and run their own scenarios.</p><p>The second -- and many of you will probably be familiar with this, is that there is a huge push for very deep asset-level data. You'll see that as it relates to the need to report at factory level and plant level for new disclosures, such as FASB, TCFD, et cetera.</p><p>In addition to that, we're seeing a lot of demand for scenario-based planning tools but also for other types of analytic tools that will help take the big swath of ESG data that's out there and actually drive insights for users. And then lastly -- but I think also, very importantly, a lot of the focus in the last several years has been on listed companies. What we're hearing from our customers is they would like to see these ESG factors, these ESG analyses applied not just to listed and public companies but also private companies and other asset classes, so for example, real estate.</p><p>Now at S&amp;P Global, many of you would probably be aware that we already play a very important role in the markets as it relates to ESG. Doug mentioned the first, which is that we have our own award-winning corporate responsibility program. But we also participate quite a bit in the industry dialogue around setting standards and frameworks for ESG.</p><p>So Dr. Richard Mattison, who's the CEO of TruCost, participates in the EU sustainable finance plan, and Mike Wilkins, from our S&amp;P Ratings group, participates in the governance panel for the TCFD. So we really help to drive the dialogue around ESG and to help make sure that there are rigorous and robust frameworks set up going forward.</p><p>And of course, last but not least, the third way we participate is that each of our divisions has very deep assets in this area. So to cut across, think about data. We have incredibly deep energy data, including carbon biofuels renewables in both Platts as well as Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence also has, really, a market-leading governance data set, which is very powerful.</p><p>When you think about analytics, I could give you some examples here that include the Platts 2-degree scenario planning service as well as the TruCost carbon scorecard. That carbon scorecard has been applied to all of the standard S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. And then finally, thinking about research and insights, Ratings just launched their Green Evaluation product last year, and within Market Intelligence, we now have a dedicated ESG team that's reporting ESG news.</p><p>And we're getting quite a bit of adoption on those products. Just in terms of the ratings themselves, a recent lookback against the ratings highlighted over 700 ratings assessments that were impacted by the E, or environmental and climate concerns, between 2015 and 2017, but if you look even outside of that into Platts and into MI, for example, in Market Intelligence, Platts already has 600 customers using their 2-degree scenario planning service. Market Intelligence has received hundreds of requests for deeper renewable data, as many of our customers are thinking about disclosures, operational risk, et cetera.</p><p>I'm not going to spend time speaking further about some of the products here because I mentioned a lot of them. I did want to also just add that, last week, TruCost launched their STG evaluation tool, which is a quantitative model that helps companies evaluate the performance -- their own performance against STGs in the context of their geographic coverage. So lots of new products coming out of our divisions also.</p><p>So you see, in each of our divisions, we have very strong assets. We have very strong products, a lot of expertise, but we did see an opportunity to really accelerate and scale these products at an S&amp;P Global level. So in December, we launched the ESG design team. It is a cross-divisional, cross-functional group, and the goal of the team is to effectively identify and prioritize opportunities in ESG that cut across the divisions. Now this is made possible by the fact that we have this common data and technology backbone that Doug referenced earlier in the session, and that's really going to help us here because data is very critical to building some of the better and more sophisticated ESG products that we'd like to do.</p><p>Our initial areas of focus are going to be on data, so we're very focused on ensuring that we have fully populated datasets for asset-level data, particularly in the energy space. We're also looking at ensuring that we can create the first foundation for what we're terming the ESG data factory. A big part of that is actually bringing all of the data we currently have in house onto the same platform, and we've made some investments there, particularly focusing on TruCost data and Platts data and bringing those data sets onto the S&amp;P Global platform.</p><p>We're also looking to focus on better educating our clients in terms of the overarching set of capabilities and products that we have around ESG. So that's going to be a quite big focus going forward. And I would say that the team itself has an incredible amount of energy and enthusiasm for this. We also see it as an incredible opportunity for us, one that is necessary really for us to serve our customers in the best possible way.</p><p>So I will finish up there. Thank you, and I'm going to hand over to Martin Fraenkel.</p><p>MARTIN E. FRAENKEL, PRESIDENT OF S&amp;P GLOBAL PLATTS INC, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: Thanks, Martina, and good afternoon to everyone. It's my privilege to introduce the Platts business to you.</p><p>The Platts business has shown strong growth for quite a number of years now, both through the ups and the downs of the commodity market cycle, and it continues to grow. The business has been favored through these ups and downs by some favorable market trends, particularly the liberalization of energy markets around the world and the increasing trade flows in all commodities.</p><p>So as we talk today about the business and using the framework which Doug lined -- outlined at the beginning, I'm going to focus on how Platts continues to grow the core business by serving our global customers and by striving to deliver them exceptional customer experience and with an increasing focus on operational excellence. I'm also going to discuss with you some of the ways in which we're applying technology to bring new and innovative solutions to the changing energy market environment.</p><p>So Platts has been serving commodity markets for over 100 years, and Platts price assessments are integral to the workflows of very many of our customers all around the world. And they're integral to multiple workflows in those customers and right through the supply chain, and that's part of the underlying strength of our business.</p><p>We have a unique platform, the eWindow platform, which is an electronic platform which shows real-time bids, offers and transactions in markets at particular times during the day, on the market on close in particular. And that's a unique competitive advantage because, once we bring customers onto the eWindow, once we bring markets onto the eWindow, it's something which none of our competitors have.</p><p>And the Platts business is the most global of the S&amp;P Global businesses. Our revenue streams are approximately evenly distributed across the 3 major geographical regions. We're slightly underweight in Asia, but Asia is our fastest-growing region. And Asia currently is much favored by those trends towards liberalization of energy markets, particularly in countries like Japan and China, which are some of the biggest energy consumers in the world.</p><p>So as we look at those markets, it's worth mentioning that our business is -- our largest business is in oil, and we think that, that's a good place to be because we're in one of the most attractive segments -- price reporting -- in the largest commodity -- oil -- and we have a very strong position in that segment of price reporting. So oil is a really important activity for us and will continue to be so.</p><p>But we have very strong positions and growing positions in other commodity markets as well. Now those commodity markets are much smaller, so they're always going to be a smaller part of our revenue mix. But we have market-leading positions in areas such as petrochemicals, metals and in natural gas in the United States.</p><p>So as we look at those mature businesses, on the left-hand side of this slide, you can see Dubai Crude oil and a suite of products around natural gas in the U.S., and these are some of our biggest markets in crude oil and natural gas. And you can see that they're continuing to grow. Now we use a number of measures to see how our markets are growing, things like the adoption of our prices, our price assessments in the physical purchase and sales contracts of our clients around the world.</p><p>But the most visible way to track the growth of our assessments is through futures contracts, which are public information and which is what are on this slide. And futures contracts become relevant to us when exchanges around the world choose to use Platts price assessments as the settlement mechanisms for those futures contracts. And generally, the futures exchanges will choose a Platts price assessment when we have traction in the physical markets, when market users are using our assessments, and when they think there's an opportunity, obviously, to launch a financial derivative against them. So what excites us at the moment is not only do we have a strong position in our existing markets, but we think we're winning the whitespace in new emerging commodity markets.</p><p>On the right-hand side of this slide, we mention and we show the futures on 3 of those markets: iron ore, steel scrap and, most recently, the Black Sea wheat contract. Now it may be hard to see on this slide, but the axes are differently labeled on these graphs, so I don't want you at all to think that the emerging benchmarks are at the stage of development of the established ones. They're not. These are all relatively early stage benchmarks at different stages of developments.</p><p>But what you can see, I think fairly clearly on these futures contracts, is that there is traction in all of these benchmarks. And the traction is reflection -- reflective of the fact that they've already been adopted in physical markets around the world.</p><p>Another point to note on this slide is that the exchanges which have listed these contracts are multiple. They are ICE, the Intercontinental Exchange; CME group; SGX, which is the Singapore Exchange; LME, the London Metal Exchange; and also Tokyo, the Tokyo Commodity Market, which has the Dubai contract listed.</p><p>So you can see that we have multiple exchange relationships, and building those relationships is core to having a global business and growing these benchmarks. But the -- probably, the assessment that we are most excited about at the moment is LNG, liquefied natural gas. Liquefied natural gas is a condensed concentrated form of gas, which can be shipped around the world, and the trade in LNG is connecting gas markets around the world, and we already hold a very strong position in North American gas and in other gas markets.</p><p>And the trade flows in LNG are changing, and I would encourage you, if you already haven't had a chance, to have a look at the product showcase outside. Doug mentioned or Chip mentioned the energy data wall, which shows you real-time trade flows in LNG among other asset classes.</p><p>So as these trade flows are changing, the pricing structure is changing from long-term contracts to spot contracts. And that gives opportunities for price assessment agencies such as ourselves. Platts launched its LNG assessment, the JKM marker, JapanKorea Marker, in 2009, and we've been working at it ever since. And our assessment has been used as a settlement mechanism for futures contracts on CME, ICE and TOCOM.</p><p>And you can see on the top graph on the right-hand side of this slide that those derivatives have taken off in the last couple of years. And this is indicative of the inflection point we believe that LNG trading around the world has reached, and we think that this is going to continue to grow for years to come and will change the structure of gas markets around the world.</p><p>So our position in LNG has been recognized by third parties. Earlier on this year, Reuters published an article saying that in the battle to establish the benchmark for LNG pricing in Asia, which many price assessment agencies, exchanges and others have been competing for, Reuters said that Platts had won the battle. So there's still a lot of work to be done, but we're very encouraged by this.</p><p>And why does this matter? Because if we establish a benchmark in the way that we have done in many occasions in the past, it establishes a strong and recurring revenue stream for the business. The benchmark becomes embedded in the clients' processes in the ways that I describe. And that we can then have multiple applications which continue to grow the revenue stream thereafter. And that's what really drives the resilience of the Platts business model.</p><p>So what you can see on the right-hand side of this slide is that as many of you know, commodity prices collapsed in 2014 and '15, and going into '16, and several of our customer segments had really dramatic -- and this had a dramatic impact on the revenue streams of some of our customers, particularly in the oil and gas upstream sector but also on the commodity businesses of banks and other financial market players, many of whom either exited commodity markets or severely curtailed their businesses.</p><p>Throughout this downturn, Platts' business continued to grow. And that's a testimony to the resilience of this business model that I've described, particularly as these benchmarks become established. It's also explained by the diversity of our client base. As you can see, we have customers in consuming as well as producing sectors. And overall, it's supported by a revenue stream which is over 90% based on subscription and that 90% renews at a renewal rate of 94%. So it's a strong business model.</p><p>The remaining 9% is what we call the Global Trading Services revenues, GTS revenues, and these are linked through our licensing agreements with exchanges to certain key contracts on those exchanges. And similar to exchange volumes, those revenues are much more volatile.</p><p>So as we move forward, we think that we can build on the solid base that we already have to apply some of the technology and innovation across the organization to move the business further forward. We can simplify our processes. We can bring our technology platforms together, and that will allow us both to operate the business more efficiently but also to provide new products to our customers going -- leveraging both across data across Platts, but also going outside of Platts into Market Intelligence, Ratings, in the way that Martina was discussing, for example, in ESG and in other areas.</p><p>And we think it will also give us opportunities to improve the customer experience for our clients. We're well advanced in integrating our analytics acquisitions, which have been made over several years, so that we have one voice to the customer, one interface to the customer, where we currently have multiple websites, and we will use the S&amp;P Global platform for that interface for customers, so it will provide an overall better experience. We will also be able to simplify our product packaging to allow us to move more rapidly towards enterprise solutions, the advantages of which Mike discussed earlier.</p><p>And as we move forward with that innovation, we believe that as we -- with that customer experience, we also believe we will be able to continue to innovate. I mentioned the eWindow. It's 10 years old now. We continue to add new applications and new markets onto the eWindow, most recently a specialist petrochemical market just a couple of weeks ago in Singapore.</p><p>And we also are using new technologies, such as Blockchain, to solve our customer experiences. We announced a successful application of Blockchain technology in the Port of Fujairah a couple of months ago to allow the port and the port -- the tank owners to put their inventory data on an aggregate basis through blockchain, which would allow Platts to publish that data.</p><p>It's a key part of allowing the Port of Fujairah to bring more transparency to markets, and it allowed the inventory owners, who have proprietary knowledge of the inventory in their individual tanks, to do that in a secure way and with an audit trail. So we believe this was one of the first, if not the first, successful application of blockchain technology in the Middle East, if not in global energy markets. It's resonated very highly with our customer base. I'd encourage you again to look at the product showcase outside to get more details of this. But we think that this is exactly the same process as we've used successfully over the years with eWindow to grow our ecosystem by using technology.</p><p>So as we move forward, our focus will be to continue to extend the core through innovation, responding to energy market and commodity markets evolution, will simplify our product strategy, and our platform strategy, increasingly using the S&amp;P Global platform, and that will enable us to drive the commercial transformation, moving to enterprise pricing models.</p><p>Thank you. I'm going to ask Martina and Mike to rejoin me for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay, we have some folks that will have microphones. So if you'd like to ask a question, please raise your hand. We ask, in light of what Mike said earlier about the transcripts and the value we can get, okay, it's incredibly important you state your name and your firm's name very clearly.</p><p>We're going to -- I'm going to take a risk here. We'll start with Peter Appert, but, Peter, you understand, just because you've got the microphone now, you can't keep it after the first question, okay?</p><p>PETER PERRY APPERT, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: We're sticking with the rule of no more than 10 questions...</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Exactly. So we're going to start with Peter.</p><p>PETER PERRY APPERT: Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. So 2 questions, actually, for Mike Chinn. So the margin improvement story has been really impressive over the last few years. Your margins are now approaching pretty much at the level of [facs] that are close to it, certainly better than what Thomson Reuters is doing. So can you quantify us -- for us how much is left and what the runway can be from here? And then the second question, I guess, Mike for you, maybe for Martin as well, that you spend a lot of time discussing your global platform. How do you help us think about how meaningful that is? Is it a cost-motivated program primarily? Is it something that moves the needle from a product standpoint as well? What drives it? And quantification of any cost-benefit you see from it.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Thanks, Peter. So the first question around margins. I mean, look, we certainly think there's more to do. We've made a lot of progress, as you noted. But we think there's more to do there. We'd like to be sort of best in class around both growth and margin. Clearly, there's a balance there over time. I think we've made good headway in things that were not easy, but were clear. And we have more to do. So our goal is -- and I think Ewout's going to talk about this at the tail end, but we think sort of mid- to upper 30s is where we can get to over time, and at the same time, we know that we operate in a competitive space. Technology investments are really important. We're going to have to continue to make plenty of those. And at some point, there is a balance between continuing to invest for long-term revenue growth, which we think is really meaningful to a premium multiple and capturing a lot of that as margin. So there's more to do. Maybe I'll start on the second question and Martin can jump in. Around the platform, I'd say there are a couple of primary motivations there. The first is, we think it's just simply more efficient from an overall S&amp;P Global technology spend to reuse and share architecture and technology wherever we can. So not only over time, that certainly creates a cost advantage over time that's difficult to quantify, but we also think, maybe more importantly, that it helps everyone get to market quicker. Building these complicated software distribution systems is a lot of work, and we think that by sharing what we've been able to do over the last couple of years on the Market Intelligence side with everyone else enables them to make the kind of changes that everyone -- that they want to make to their businesses and just get there quicker. And time to market is really important in our world.</p><p>MARTIN E. FRAENKEL: Yes, I'd echo that. I mean, when we talk about the platform, and within Platts, we were already looking at how can we bring our customer platforms into one place from the multiple platforms, which we currently have from the analytics acquisitions. And you start to look around in the marketplace, and then the SNL acquisition happened, and we're looking at the way forward, and it really doesn't make sense to start building something new when you've got a best-in-class solution which is in your sister company. So I think that just purely from a practical approach perspective, you wouldn't go it a different way. But then when you start to sort of dig a bit deeper, you start to think about, well, what are the proper product opportunities which may come out of here, and the analysts in all of our divisions, they ask us really regularly about this in terms of, well, how far have you got on this? When are we going to be able to use different data across the organization? because they can see the opportunities.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay, we're down here? Alex?</p><p>ALEXANDER KRAMM, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF EXCHANGES, EBROKERS, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Alex Kramm, UBS. Anyways, I actually -- I want to start with Martina. I don't have (inaudible). But making a big -- I guess, first time really you got to make [a big] discussion about ESG. Just curious about the longer-term bigger-picture plans, I think, I like to comment around this is not just about the investor side, but there's so much more. But when we talk to investors, it's kind of like S&amp;P -- and I was in Europe yesterday. I think it came up pretty low on the list in terms of having the ESG franchise, I think, maybe number 4, and I'm being generous. So I mean, are you trying to be #1 or 2 at some point? Do you have to buy somebody to get there? And then, maybe just lastly, maybe could you disclose how much -- sorry. Hopefully, everybody heard this, but can you actually just -- do I have to repeat all of this now? Can you actually just close connect the -- what you define as your ESG revenues all in across all the different segments?</p><p>MARTINA L. CHEUNG: Yes, so we covered the first part of it, which is -- there is -- I mean, there is a fairly buoyant market out there right now in the sense that there are a lot of different players trying to respond. We view it, frankly, as still being in very early innings in terms of ESG, and you only have to look at the number of frameworks that are being developed by regulators, industry groups, et cetera, to understand just how early this is in terms of the forming of the market. And so, there's a lot of runway here. And we don't think it's a winner-takes-all situation. So there's got to be room for a couple of different perspectives. In the market, it's incredibly important to have a broad base of perspectives, and it's for that reason we'll have -- even within S&amp;P Global, we'll have perspectives from Ratings, we'll have perspectives from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, from Market Intelligence, et cetera. So hopefully, that gets to the first part of your question. I think in terms of the second part of your question, so we have -- as you've probably guessed, we don't break ESG out today. In many cases, it's actually bundled into enterprise contracts, for example, so it's quite difficult to get a sense for what's specifically and directly ESG. Our best analysis, I guess, is a range of around $20 million that's direct ESG, but that's not counting quite a bit of indirect revenues as well that we couldn't necessarily separate. So that's where we are right now.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Right. We'll go here -- we'll go to the way back. Hamzah?</p><p>HAMZAH MAZARI, SENIOR ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: It's Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Maybe for Mike to start. You have exposure to commercial banking insurance. You highlight those as sort of 52% of your mix. They're growing much faster. If you look at your competition, they're not really penetrated there. So maybe just talk about how defensible that is. Do you have a large private equity competitor that's going to close their deal soon? Can they penetrate that market? Just help us understand sort of the competitive set and how you defend that diversity.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: So in that 52%, I would say -- I'm not sure I would say that it's less competitive, but I think the competitors are different, as you point out. You know, I can't speak too much to their plans, but I would just say that over time, some of those larger competitors have chosen -- have been in those markets before and have chosen to get out. And then also, some have started to inch their way in. I'd say we have a few advantages. One is we've been across a lot of the different legacy assets across Market Intelligence. Virtually all of those businesses that have now come together have been operating in banking and nonfinancial corporates and insurance for a very long time. So this isn't a new thing for us. It's a longtime focus. So I think we've built some really deep -- as I -- we've tried to illustrate for you some very deep broad relationships that we think are quite sticky, where we, year-after-year in those markets, continue to find new use cases and new personas where we can bring our information and our analytics and help them solve new problems. So that's what's really driving the growth. It's also -- there's also just frankly, a lot of companies to sell to in those spaces. So we're very positive on that space. It's not that we're not investing in investment banking and investment management. We are. Because investment management is our biggest segment. But we just think that we need to direct a lot of investment to those areas because you can see in the numbers that it's a very rich source of growth for us.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Let's go right here in the -- yes.</p><p>CONOR BURKE FITZGERALD, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. Mike, just a question for you. It feels like the marginal investment dollar from some of your customers is moving from the back office to the front office. Just wondering if that's something you're seeing from your customers? And what products are you focused on using to capture that investment dollar trend?</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: I think that's true, that things are starting to sort of swing to the front office. I think everyone's focused on revenue growth and product differentiation and all those sorts of things. I think probably where we're seeing that the most are in some of these corporate areas, certainly in banking and insurance, in a lot of the underwriting and lending functions. I think that, perhaps, those groups have been a little later to embrace sort of these new workflows and new ways of doing things, and any time we can get in the front office or where we can directly diagnose a problem that speaks to revenue generation, we love to be in those areas because it's just easier to talk about a product that's helping you drive top line than something that sitting off in the back office and helping you drive efficiencies. And so, I think in those markets, we're certainly seeing that. We're in a lot of insurance product design and development areas in the corporate space. We love to be in strategy and corp dev too because that's maybe not exactly front office but certainly helping drive growth and drive strategic positioning. So I think your point is a good one, and I think we are seeing it, and we are increasingly focused on training our people to be able to have those conversations.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Let's go way over there. Tim?</p><p>TIMOTHY <person><nameText>JOHN MCHUGH, </nameText></person>PARTNER &amp; GLOBAL SERVICES ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Tim McHugh with William Blair. Just asking on the data feeds growth that you talked about. The growth looks great, but I would have to think of that as a more competitive type area just because there's others who can offer somewhat similar data feeds. So how is competition? How do you differentiate and how price-sensitive are the clients when you're trying to grow that product right now?</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: I would say that the data feed business is similarly competitive to the desktop, because a lot of the same players are in that space. In terms of differentiation, we always come back to uniqueness of content, proprietary of course is great, linked together effectively, we think we're really good at that. Quality is everything as people are back-testing models, I mean, high quality and low quality sorts itself out pretty quickly, and we think we win on quality. It's -- from a pricing perspective, I'd say that the ticket prices tend to be higher. There is appetite to pay for data. The sales cycles tend to be longer because we're engaging with lots of different people to get one of those opportunities across the finish line, including technology and data folks on the client side, but it's very sticky once we're in. The renewal rates are really, really high. So we love the business. We think we can do more there, but from a product development perspective and a commercial perspective. And then alternative data really is a whole different set of opportunities for us.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: We'll take one last question before the refreshment break. So down here in front.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK, DIRECTOR &amp; LEAD RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Manav Patnaik with Barclays. I just had a broader build versus buy question for each of you, so Mike, you talked a lot about alternate data and technology and building that out. Like, is that technology helping you get unstructured data and structuring it? Or do you need to buy the structured data. For Martin, for you as well, like you're putting all these brands together, I guess now, like how much more whitespace is there that you think you can acquire, and I think, Martina, you sort of answered it but just -- I know you guys acquired TruCost, but is there more that you need to do? Or is this now an organic buildout?</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: So on the alternative data question and the way forward there, I think there are a number of different ways to address that. We bought Panjiva, which had a great business on its own but also is definitionally alternative data in a way. We thought that made sense for us. There's also -- partnerships are very typical in this space, whether those are revenue shares or just buying the rights to distribute content on a proprietary basis. So I think we'll do what we think makes sense, but there are a number of different ways to do that and a number of different models for bringing that alternative data to our platform. And we'll pursue all of them.</p><p>MARTIN E. FRAENKEL: And I think as far as the Platts business is concerned, I mean, we've gotten very strong organic market positions in most of our markets, so we think organic growth is going to be important, but there will -- and we continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions to build out the product set, and there are opportunities, and they come and we review them regularly and when they make sense, then we'll proceed.</p><p>MARTINA L. CHEUNG: And I would just say, there is so much that we can do organically. And I mean one of the reasons why we might not have [factors as highly in conversation] within Europe is that we haven't to date done a good enough job of connecting the dots between the divisions. And that's really -- the goal of the design team is to do that and there is quite a bit of low-hanging fruit, I mentioned bringing TruCost onto the global platform, Platts data onto the global platform. Even connecting what we do on Platts and MI around energy with the asset level data that we have is very powerful. And of course, we're talking to third parties where we have to fill data gaps, but those are immediate areas of focus.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay, I took an audible there and stole 5 minutes from your refreshment break. So we can do 5 more minutes of Q&amp;A. So please be back here at 2:40.</p><p>Move.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Can you hear me? Yes, great. Okay, please take your seats. Let's get started, I think you guys did pretty well with the bottleneck in the men's restroom. So let's continue with the program. And now up next is Alex Matturri, talking about our Index business. So Alex.</p><p>ALEXANDER J. MATTURRI, CEO OF S&amp;P DOW JONES INDICES LLC, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: So good afternoon. This afternoon, I'd like to give you a little bit of insight into how S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is going to be powering the markets of the future. Our core business continues to be the same, which is it's continuing to develop indices for use in investment products and as a measurement of investment performance. We're very focused from a global perspective, both in terms of the markets that we serve and the underlying assets that we use to build our indices, and take a laser focus on our customers and just as importantly our customers' customers, because at the end of the day, those are the people that are actually driving the investment dollars going into these investment products.</p><p>And we believe in the continuous innovation, which for us means continuing to develop indices that become relevant for market participants. So how do we do this? So S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is one of the largest providers of indices globally. We have almost $14 trillion benchmarked to our indices and our products run the gamut of asset classes and geographies. In terms of the indices that we develop that we offer out, we cover U.S. and global equities, frontier markets, commodities, fixed income, volatility, real estate and other economic indicators and we offer these from a global perspective in terms of the underlying regions that they cover.</p><p>In addition, we have a full suite of indices that are specialized versions of these standard indices. These include things like ESG that you heard Martina talk about earlier, factors or sectors, different ways of slicing and dicing the market in new ways. In addition, we provide research and analytics that help support the use of our indices for investors and we continue to offer custom index capabilities, where we actually calculate indices for typically banks or asset managers, where it's their own intellectual property and they need an independent index calculation agent.</p><p>So over the past 4 years, our compounded annual growth rate has been 10% and this revenue mix for us continues to be about 80% coming from market forces. These are the assets under management tied to the products that we earn for licensing our intellectual property. These could be structured products, index funds, ETFs, trading volumes tied to exchange-traded derivatives based on our indices, with the remaining 20% coming from our custom index business, plus the sale of our real-time or in-the-day data.</p><p>From a revenue mix, we always show up as very U.S.-centric, but I urge caution when you look at that and that's really a function of where our customers are headquarters (sic) [headquartered]. Our largest customers are the ETF providers, the banks and most of them get billed out of the U.S. so our revenue shows up as U.S., regardless of where the underlying customers are, the people using the products and also what the underlying, where the products may be listed. So what's been driving the growth of our business? The biggest trend has been this continued shift from actively managed strategies to passive strategies. If you look at the chart in the middle, over the past 10 years, there's been almost an equal amount of money that's been flowing out of actively managed mutual funds into ETFs and index funds. And today, the definition of an index product or a passive product is much broader than the traditional view of just a cap-weighted index and is quite, quite broad. But what's been driving this sort of growth? It's been a desire for investors to look for lower cost products. They want cheaper products, they want more transparent products, there's been this fiduciary option of advisers nowadays to seek lower-cost products and there's been this growing importance of the distribution channels for investment-based products that have been driving a lot of this. And we see these trends coming to -- continue into the future.</p><p>If you look in the right-hand side, one area of particular growth has been smart beta. These are ways of slicing indices into fundamental factors, into different ways of driving performance. This is an area that we see, again, continue very, very strong growth and our own efforts in this area now have reached over $250 billion indexed to this.</p><p>So let's dig a little bit deeper into the growth of our business. Here in the U.S, which we think is one of the more indexed markets in the world, our estimates are that there is only about 20% of U.S. equity capital markets that's indexed. So there's still plenty of room for this growth to continue into the future. When we look at this on a global basis, we're starting from much smaller levels, both in Europe and in Asia, but again, the growth rates are going to be much faster as these markets are now starting to go through the evolution that's happened in the U.S. over the past few years. So we think there's plenty of room to continue growing over the near term.</p><p>Now an important aspect of our success is how we operate across the full index value chain. Our direct customers are the people that we license our index -- intellectual property to, these are the product issuers. The ETF providers, the mutual funds, exchanges, these are the people that use our IP, use our indices to develop products that they sell into the marketplace. But just as important to us are the indirect customers, or the customers of our customers and it starts really with the distribution chains -- the distribution channels. These are like the financial advisers, the consultants that are now becoming the important gatekeepers to making investment decisions for a lot of investors. These are the wirehouses, firms like Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch that are now getting more and more involved in making these decision on behalf of investors. And then there is the actual end investors themselves, the actual asset owners. These could be pension funds, these could be the sovereign wealth funds that you find throughout the world. Doug mentioned GPIF, one of our large clients based in Japan, the largest single-asset pool in the world.</p><p>In addition to individual investors, they're all part of the value chain that we seek to serve. Now our commercial strategy targets each of these segments differently. We target the direct customers through our licensing efforts with our product teams, with our research teams to make sure that they have the support necessary as they launch their products. And our business model is very much aligned with the success of our customers. We get paid typically basis points or some sort of variable fee tied to the success of the assets that are accumulated, or the volumes that come from trading of indices, that are -- the products that are tied to our indices.</p><p>So we do a lot to help their efforts to grow and capture assets. But just as importantly is the amount of time that we spend. We have separate teams that call -- we call our channel strategy, that go after the financial advisers, that call on consultants. And here the goal is really to get involved in the benchmark selection process, make sure they understand the indices, influence that decision, because by influencing the decision about what index you're going to use, that's going to indirectly influence the actual products that these customers will end up using. And then, of course, there is the end investors. More and more, we are seeing sophisticated pension funds that are using index-based strategies to meet their asset allocation needs and working with them to come up with customized solutions for them is very, very important.</p><p>Now this approach has several benefits. First of all, it keeps us very close to the customers. We understand what's going on in the marketplace, we understand what their needs are and we can factor that into our index development process. Just as importantly, a lot of our efforts help our direct customers. We help them in terms of actually raising assets, going out and talking about indices. We go on roadshows with the banks that issue structured products. And again, because their interests are aligned, if they are successful, our revenues are also successful. So this loop becomes very, very important. Now there's been much discussion about fee compression and ETFs. But fees are not the only drivers of success in this important market segment. It's important when we look at ETFs to think about all the factors that really drive success and it really comes down to the total cost of ownership, not just the expense ratio itself. What's the bid-ask spread on that ETF? How liquid is it? Who has the first-mover advantage? Is that ETF being used as a hedge for structured products? There's a lot of factors that drive success and fees are not just the only component of that. If you look to the right, there is 3 large S&amp;P 500 ETFs here in the U.S -- the Vanguard product, the iShares product and then the State Street product, the SPDR product. The State Street product, of course, was the first to market. Now that's the product that actually has the highest expense ratio and yet that's still the most popular product to be used, it's still the largest product -- largest ETF product in the world and a lot of that is due to a function of, it's got such a tight bid-ask spread, the liquidity of this is so good that people could move money in and out of this product all the time and people are willing to pay for higher -- pay higher fees to access that sort of liquidity. And this phenomena is not just with the S&amp;P 500, we see this with many other indices, that the lowest-cost product is not necessarily the product that captures the assets. You have to look at in its totality and it's not just a function of just our own indices, we see this even with some of our competitors.</p><p>Now an important part of our success has always been our exchange strategy. We have 14 exchange partners throughout the world and we've emphasized the faster-growing markets, the markets that are earlier in their development cycle, and it's a symbiotic relationship that we develop with these exchanges. With the exchange itself, what do they get out of these sort of partnerships? Well, certainly they get the commercial reach that we could offer them, that they can't get on their own. We can commercialize their indices in ways that they hadn't thought of, ways that we can protect intellectual property to make sure that they're actually earning money on the use of their indices, where many of them used to give this all away.</p><p>Just as importantly, we bring their index development to global standards. This is becoming more and more important as we've become now regulated in Europe and in other markets. So it brings it to that level that these indices can be used in Europe, because if they're not available to meet those global centers, they can't be a part of products there, for example. And of course, we can continue to develop new unindexed concepts that they're just not used to thinking about. And from our side, we gain a benefit of being in the markets with a strong local player. We get access to the local brand, which is important as we develop products for these local marketplaces, much better to go into Japan, for example, using the TOPIX brand, than just using an S&amp;P brand and so everything we develop with the Tokyo Stock Exchange becomes S&amp;P TOPIX. That local brand gives you a much better chance of having success, of having recognition into a lot of these markets. We also gained a strong partner that opens doors for us. They know all the pension communities. In a lot of markets, in Latin America, for example, a lot of these pension funds are buying U.S.-based products. They don't have enough local products and by having exchange partners, we get to know who the pension funds are, and we can get in and see them and talk to them about, if you're going to buy a U.S.-based product, we want it to be a product with an S&amp;P index inside. So we gain that benefit of a very strong local partner, they help us with regulators, as regulators are now starting to look at our business.</p><p>So it's -- a very important part of our global strategy is to build it around these core partners in exchanges. Now exchange partnerships are a key component of our build from the core strategy, some of you have heard me talk about this. But I want to show you how this all comes together. So in our core strategy, we have our base indices. This could be the S&amp;P 500, it could be the TOPIX in Japan, it could be the Bovespa Index in Brazil and they all have a core index that's well known. From that, we then start building out our product suite. We could start with sectors, we could apply ESG, we can make it factors, many, many different ideas, all built off of this combined brand, S&amp;P plus a local brand on this core index. The third layer is how we then figure out what's the right way to distribute this index. Is it appropriate for an ETF, should it be a structured product, should it go into a fund, who is the right partner to be the person that we license this index to, these are all factors that will help increase success.</p><p>So as an example, we took our S&amp;P BMI, which is our Broad Market Index. We applied a two-factor model that included combining intrinsic value with low volatility, two well-established factors in academic research, to create what's called the S&amp;P GIVI index. This was licensed in Japan to a lot of the index funds, including used by GPIF. And today has $28 billion in assets tied directly to that index, to this product. What made this successful was just as much having the Tokyo Stock Exchange be a partner of ours, that allowed us to distribute this with them behind it. So what does the future look like for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices? We will continue to build on our core franchise of developing indices. We'll continue to innovate these indices to meet investor needs throughout the world and we'll continue to expand globally through a partnership of product issuers and exchanges.</p><p>Thank you very much. And next up is John Berisford.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD, PRESIDENT, S&amp;P GLOBAL RATINGS INC.: All right, good afternoon, everyone. So I've got 25 minutes. I'm going to try to do 3 things. I'm going to give you a sense -- reintroduce you or introduce you to the ratings business, depending upon how familiar you are with it. The second thing I'm going to do is give you a little bit of the market backdrop for issuance and the context on why we're optimistic about issuance. And then third, and the lion's share of my time, I'd like to spend on the initiatives that we have, either in-flight, underway or imagined, to create sustainable ways of growing and creating value for this business.</p><p>So you've seen this framework before. It works really well for Ratings. On the growth side, we've got opportunities to evolve and grow our core business, and that is by extending our methodologies, our coverage, the globality of our coverage and adding new issuers to our pipeline.</p><p>On pursuing growth via adjacencies, this is about -- we have some of the richest IP and data in the franchise. And initiatives like Project Simplify are allowing us to discover and make accessible that data. And we see opportunities to create products off of that data. The one thing I would remind you is you may not see those, they may not be Ratings products. The opportunity might be in some other part of the portfolio. But we have a lot of that data, and we see growth opportunities via adjacencies leveraging that data.</p><p>On globality, you saw the news this morning. We see an opportunity to extend our coverage by extending globally. Our priorities are in Asia Pac. ASEAN countries are very attractive to us. And you obviously know we're very committed to China at this point in time.</p><p>On customer orientation, 3 years ago, we hired Chris Heusler to lead our Chief Commercial Officer organization. And we are maniacally focused on engaging with clients, and for us, that's issuers and investors. We had over 22,000 face-to-face meetings with issuer clients last year, which explains why we added net new clients in 2017.</p><p>And what that allows us to do, that dialogue with clients, it allows us to think about innovating. Often, dialogue with clients, they have a thesis that we actually have data or content somewhere in the pipeline of producing a rating that they would find valuable in a way that we're not yet giving it to them, and they're often right. And that is informing the way we think we can innovate.</p><p>Operational excellence for us is really, really important. We're a 150-year-old company, and I would fair to say -- it's fair to say that most of that time was spent building a very bespoke operating environment, largely built around the habits of how we actually handle credits, asset class by asset class, industry by industry.</p><p>And for those of you that I've spoken to before, you know we committed to really foundational work on workflow and data architecture that we're beginning to cycle to the end of, and that's allowing us to ask more sophisticated questions about how we use technology.</p><p>And then this will -- this is today, and will be for a long time, a people-intensive business. That's why when we talk about technology, we talk about augmented intelligence. We don't see a scenario where our analysts aren't setting in the -- sitting in the middle of our credit analysis, but there are ways to change the nature of their work and move them up the value chain and away from the spreadsheet jockeying that analysts can do in a very bespoke environment, by leveraging technology to do that.</p><p>So this is the business overview. Four things I would say upfront. The real attributes of this business that I love are the power of its brand. This brand is known for integrity, independence and transparency. The second thing is the globality of our coverage and the depth of our coverage. That takes a long time to build, and it's not easy to do, but our coverage is, in fact, global. The third thing is, and you would know this, we're a deeply regulated business. We have over 28 regulators around the globe. And what's happened over the course of time is that regulatory scheme has matured and so has our ability to ingest and absorb those regulations. And we think the regulation has been good for this industry and our business because it's yet another set of high standards on how we produce quality -- the highest quality ratings and forward-looking opinions. And at the end of the day, we like to believe that we compete on quality.</p><p>A couple of other facts about this business, we have 1,500 analysts globally, and that -- that analyst community is actually growing. We have 125 countries where we produce ratings. We have over 1 million credit ratings outstanding. And we've been in the market for 150 years. You would know our clients to be largely issuers, investors and intermediaries, and we take all of that client group very seriously. They give us really rich feedback about how to make our business better.</p><p>You'll see on the upper right, we have some financial momentum. We've had a good couple of years with a 7% growth CAGR. And several years ago, we saw an opportunity to sustainably and thoughtfully extend our margins, and we've done that without compromising any of the capabilities that we have to create quality in our offerings.</p><p>And then in terms of the concentration of this business, you can see we're largely North American and Europe. We have good coverage in South America. I don't know that I would call that a big growth driver over the next couple of years, but APAC should be. APAC has been growing very nicely. It's 10% of our business today. We are entering China, and I'll talk about that in detail in a minute. And we're bullish on ASEAN countries, and we think over the course of time, they'll open up the way that China has at some point in time.</p><p>Market trends creating tailwinds for this business. Total corporate debt outstanding continues to grow over time, which is a real attractive, obviously, market condition for us. I'll give you some of the details about that. Securitization market is returning after a period of softness. There were a couple of years where that got really soft, it was largely a function, in our view, of the new regulations like risk retention, and the market needed some time to absorb those. We think they've absorbed them, and we saw really good growth last year and into Q1. You heard Martina talk about ESG and cyber. Our view is that those are not passing whims, that they look like sticky themes, and we think Ratings is well positioned to incorporate them into our ratings and also leverage some of the IP and content we create to satisfy use cases on our portfolio or beyond it. And then geographic expansion in China, and I'll take you through that in more detail in a minute.</p><p>So if you look at -- we've shown this chart. This is one of Chip's favorite charts that he's ever seen in his life, the correlation between GDP growth and debt issuance. By the way, he's a very simple guy, so he only has like 2 charts. The correlation between debt issuance and GDP growth is actually quite strong and been true and stood the test of time. And what we're seeing around the globe is synchronized GDP growth. We just, earlier this year, took our GDP growth for Europe up pretty substantially, and so we like that as one of the backdrops for why we're bullish on issuance.</p><p>Capital markets are still underpenetrated. In key regions, you can see the penetration in the United States and Europe is very strong, which kind of drives you to the refinancing walls that we see on the right-hand side of the page, in the corporate refinancing chart. But China and ASEAN are actually quite underpenetrated, and that represents a real good, solid growth opportunity for us and we're committed to seeing it. And then you can see Lat Am and India are quite underpenetrated.</p><p>And then significant corporate refinancing needs in the U.S. that give us great confidence that issuance will be pretty positive or good enough.</p><p>Now on issuance, I would say, what you've seen over the last couple of years is, this is a management team in a business that's capable of maximizing good markets. And in Q1, we had a soft market, and I think we proved we can navigate the troughs pretty well as well. And so we are conscious of being able to be agile enough to adjust to market conditions.</p><p>This is the picture on structured markets. So you can see pretty strong growth in 2017 over 2016. You saw good growth in Q1. We think that is a function of real confidence in the markets. They've absorbed the regulations and I think gotten comfortable with those regulations. And then over on the right, leveraged loans are -- have more than doubled in the last 8 years. And in the U.S., there are over 1,000 issuers, which is really good growth and gives us a good indication that those markets are very healthy.</p><p>So we have multiple opportunities to extend into new markets, and this is the way we think about it on the left-hand side, so this is an opportunity for us to expand coverage beyond our cross-border credit ratings. And being in the domestic market allows us to participate in the build-out of the credit culture and gives us relevance, more relevance than someone not participating in the domestic markets, to be even more relevant for the cross-border stuff. Supporting capital market development, as I mentioned, building that credit culture. And what we've seen is, large developed bond markets and emerging markets really need foreign direct investment. And the governments of those countries and the regulators see us as a real attractive way to bring transparency to that market and, therefore, attract investment into that market. We have 2-pass, 3-pass, really. We can buy a domestic rating agency, we can do a JV to the extent that we can't fully own a subsidiary, or we could go greenfield. The markets that are attractive to us, working from the bottom up, Philippines and Vietnam are on our watchlist. Malaysia and Indonesia and Thailand, we have JV arrangements with domestic rating agencies. We can't fully own a subsidiary, but at some point in time that may happen. And if it does, we're really well positioned, and those bond market markets are quite large. And then in South Korea, we just entered into a commercial arrangement with a domestic rating agency. We'll see how Korea develops, but it's -- we view it as attractive for the moment.</p><p>So let's talk about China. So we're going to enter China with a greenfield. A year ago, China opened up the market to the large rating agencies, and we pursued parallel paths. We were looking at a domestic rating agency, and we were looking at what it would take to build a greenfield in China. Our assumption was that given the opening up of the markets, the domestic rating agencies would -- valuations would come down. And while we believed that, they didn't. And so one of the things that caused us to choose to go greenfield is, valuations remain very high, and at the end of the day, we like the idea. And to be frank, the shareholder structure would have been a little complicated. And a greenfield allows us to enter the market on our pace and be in more control of the analytics. And in the end, that's what we've decided to do, and we're quite convicted about it. So we're going to build a leading rating agency in China, 100% S&amp;P-owned. The idea methodologically or analytically is to take the domestic scale and, over the course of time, build it into a China scale but, ultimately, over the long term, would map to our global scale. We have to be sensitive to not being disruptive to the inter-bond market or the bank markets in China, and so we think there's a way to do that and be quite relevant. And our dialogue with the PBOC has been really productive. They've been very clear about what their needs are. They've been very inquisitive about the global regulatory landscape for CRAs. And our dialogue gives us optimism that we can find the right path forward in China.</p><p>You guys have probably seen Ratings360. So Ratings360 is a digital platform that delivers our ratings and a whole bunch of other content to issuers. So think about this product as compared with some of the stuff that Martina and Mike own, as a product for issuers. We have other use cases that we might extend it to, but at the end of the day, think about it as issuer. It's a -- you can see it's a simple way for issuers to see the ratings. They can begin to compare peer sets and suppliers. It's beginning to include forms of alternative data like investor sentiment, and that's a consistent theme across our portfolio. We're getting comfortable with how we use that kind of data. Our economic research, and it gives them a way to engage with their analyst. We are quite confident that this is a very differentiated offering in this space, and we're proud that we built it. And it's an example of really good synergies and collaboration across the portfolio, because while we built the content and the prototype, Mike and his team built the production version, and we think that makes good sense. Otherwise, I would have, over the course of time, had to make some investments that would have been redundant with his.</p><p>We see other forms of innovation. So Green Evaluations, think about Green Evaluations as an issue-level assessment. So this a bond. This is the A credit rating. We've done somewhere around 30 evaluations since we launched our methodologies a year ago, and the pipeline is building. This pipeline is actually quite rich. This is what we know today, but this is building quite nicely for us. And then we look at things like transparency score, governance and mitigation score. We also think, beyond credit ratings, our analytical capabilities allow us to think about other forms of assessment, and ESG is one of those forms of assessment. So think about that as an entity-level assessment, where Green Evaluations is more focused on the bond.</p><p>Another synergy opportunity is that we're leveraging TruCost data, and we were introduced to TruCost by the index business, and they are -- they have been a wonderful partner. And importantly, we've spun up 2 teams in S&amp;P Ratings. One is an analytical innovation team. Don't think about that as commercial, but think about it as getting the market feedback that we get from issuers and advisers and thinking about how do we extend our footprint through methodologies or coverage. And then the second is, we have a green finance team led by one of our ESG experts in Europe, and this is a cross practice, cross sector team that is looking for the right set of methodologies, data and scoring for us to be relevant in an ESG assessment.</p><p>And then on cyber security, we created -- we entered into a partnership with Cyence. Cyence is a cyber threat data and analytics company. And you've seen a lot of that data in Ratings360, but this offers visibility into a new risk. And we're quite convinced that our issuer clients are going to find that data, coupled with our own models and data, to be very useful as they think about risk broadly.</p><p>This is a Ratings presentation, so the core of what we do is analytical excellence. We get feedback all the time informally and formally, and here is what issuers and investors tell us. Our strengths are our brand. Our brand stands for integrity, transparency and quality. Our reach is extensive and global. So we show up with a point of view, quality ratings and forward-looking credit opinions. Our coverage continues to get stronger, and the quality of our analysts are a distinguishing feature, and we intend to maintain that differentiation.</p><p>They also tell us that we have opportunities to improve. One of the areas is market engagement, and by market engagement, what we mean is analytical engagement with investors. Those gaps are important for us to close, and so under [Jan Lepolik's] leadership and our analytical practices, we are doing a lot of training and a lot of -- we have a lot of initiatives to get our analytical teams more engaged with investors and close those gaps. And we made progress last year in that area. I expect us to make more progress over the course of the next year.</p><p>And then the last thing is, 3 years ago, when we took an honest assessment of our technology and data capabilities, we had a lot of technical debt. And by that, I mean software systems that weren't running to their performance standards and a lot of complexity. And so we're addressing that through our analytical organization as well. So the priorities here are analytical engagement with investors; augmented intelligence, which is about -- and I'll talk more about this in a second, but this isn't about replacing our analysts. We don't see that in the future. But we do see leveraging technology to augment what they do. Not everything they consider is important to the outcome of a rating, and some of those things lend themselves quite well to technological solutions. Analytical talent and leadership. One of the things that I assure you we do in this business is, we sweat leadership appointments. We fundamentally believe that leadership appointments matter and drive a lot of value, and we are focused on continuity and expertise and sector knowledge in our analytical organizations. But on the flip side, we've been aggressively retooling our IT and data capabilities. You can imagine, as we deal with that technical debt and retire some of those dated systems, we have to find new sources of talent with different skills. And the 2 areas I would point out are data science and software engineering, which were not in our wheelhouse; and then finally, we're simplifying our organization. Over the course of time, I think, in response to a variety of factors in the market, we got a little clunky and complicated in our organization structure. We saw an opportunity to simplify, especially the way we thought about our methodologies, the development of those methodologies and the validation of those methodologies. But broadly, we saw an opportunity to simplify the organization. You saw us take a Q4 charge, and we actioned those matters in Q1, and we're beginning to see some cost benefit from that as well. But the real purpose of this was to define absolute role clarity and accountability, because only with that can we execute well. And when that's diffused or distributed, you're guessing about the level of execution you're going to get, and we're confident those actions will help us do that.</p><p>Just a couple of minutes on technology and data. 3 years ago, we committed to a pretty transformative tech and data agenda. You can see the processing capabilities on the left-hand side, but what we've really done is deal with workflow. And Project Simplify was the project by which we wanted to standardize our workflow. We have 3 practices to go. We're in the tail end of that. And importantly, our #1 goal was 100% standardization of our analytical workflow, and we are achieving that to date and would expect to achieve that at the end.</p><p>The other thing that we're working on is our data architecture. We have an initiative called our integrated data facility. And we're doing some of this work with Mike's team on data factory. But the rest, content and publishing, sales and distribution other than Ratings360, remain in front of us. And the outcomes we're looking for are digitized analytical workflow, which we've accomplished. And just to give you another highlight of Simplify, much of the data that you see in Ratings360 was discovered and enabled by implementing standardized workflow in our analytical practices, right? I mean, at the end of the day, that's hard to do when the data is inconsistent or inaccessible or undiscoverable. And so that little project on -- or massive project, if you're one of our analysts, is actually enabling other streams of value, and the best example of that is data that's actually showing up in Simplify.</p><p>Augmented intelligence, the Ratings360 platform. On data factory, I've mentioned to some of you that we committed to moving our data factory in chunks over the course of time to Market Intelligence. One of the things we found attractive about SNL in combining it with Cap IQ was, they run data factories to scale. And if you think about what I want in terms of data ingestion, I want the highest quality on the lowest landed cost, and MI can do that. And so we're through phase 1 of that and are optimistic about the next chapter of that.</p><p>So 3 use cases for augmented intelligence. And these are early days, so don't ask me questions about how much value I'm going to get out of that in Q2. But we're bullish on the potential here. On ratings production, so this is the factors that our analysts consider on the way to producing a rating. And what we're trying to understand is, which of those are really highly correlated to rating outcomes? And what of those are not as highly correlated to rating outcomes? And to the extent that we can use more sophisticated technology to create algorithmic or technological ways to do that, what that allows us to do is move our analysts forward in the value chain to do more value-added stuff and out of the work that you can imagine they do when they're operating in a very bespoke environment without standardized workflow.</p><p>Surveillance optimization, we have 1.1 million credits outstanding, and we surveil those, right, all the time. And one of the things we're really excited about talking to Kensho about, and we've had sessions about this to date, is what we can't do today is see signals and patterns in that big tranche of data. So what we do is surveil them periodically, annually against some schedule. But we also know that, that surveillance doesn't always produce a rating -- a change in a rating. And so we love the notion of being able to see those signals and patterns, both to extend the quality of our offering and get the ratings right all the time, but also to be able to engage in credits that we think the conditions have changed on. And that also allows us to think about how we use our analysts' time and move them more forward in the value chain, and they are very exciting propositions.</p><p>And then data and IP distribution, this is about unlocking more of the data. You would be surprised how much data we create, how much data and content we create on the way to producing a rating, that we don't do anything with, right? And our clients have been very helpful in telling us, \"I'll bet you have this. I'd like to see that. I'd like to see it in this format.\" And we'll sort out over time who gets credit for that and what P&amp;L it shows up in. But we're very confident we can be a driver of growth, either on our own portfolio or across the portfolio.</p><p>So let me wrap up here. Our priorities, if they're not clear by now, are to strengthen our analytical excellence, and we think both in traditional ways and leveraging technology, is a useful way to do that. Executing our tech and data strategy, which is getting -- which is moving from being more foundational to more transformational. And we're quite excited about the growth opportunities in Asia Pac and excited to get started in China.</p><p>So thank you very much. I'm going to turn this thing over to Mike Chinn, who's going to host the technology panel, and I'll talk to you guys later.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: All right. So for our next session here today, we are going to spend 20 minutes drilling into this topic of technology that has come up over and over again today and get some insights from these gentlemen who've joined me on the stage around some of those issues.</p><p>So let me do quick introductions. On my far left here is Nick Cafferillo. Nick is Chief Technology Officer of S&amp;P Global. In his background has worked for a number of financial information businesses over time. He's always had product roles, so he understands the direct impact to clients and the amazing things that we can do when we bring technology to solving client problems. So welcome, Nick. And then I have Daniel Nadler right here on my left. Daniel is Founder and CEO of Kensho. He is an academic by training but one with tremendous commercial sensibilities. And Daniel started Kensho a few years ago and has stockpiled just an amazing group of talented data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning experts. I mean, so we're thrilled to welcome Kensho to the S&amp;P fold just in the last couple of months.</p><p>So let's get into a few things. So, Nick, Doug referenced the new operating model in his opening remarks that has sought to bring together technology, software engineering and data operations across the franchise. So maybe you can kick us off by telling us what that means for S&amp;P and what does that mean for our clients.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO, CTO, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: Sure. Yes, great. I think everybody's heard from the different presenters that technology and data really sit at the core of who we are, and there's a lot to get done. I think what excites me about the new operating model is we're bringing technology and data operations forward. We're bringing it to our clients. We're making it a part of our commercial organization, our business organizations. We're getting out in front of clients. We're listening to our clients' problems. And we're taking all of that information in to what we're doing internally. And we play an interesting role in the market, because not only can we learn from our clients and make our products better, but what we're finding is, many of our clients are struggling with the same challenges that we have. They want to understand how to use the cloud more effectively. They want to understand machine learning and artificial intelligence and when maybe they can apply that. And they're turning to us as a trusted partner for a lot of that information. And so it's really a great opportunity to showcase the things that we can do and to learn from those things.</p><p>I would say the second benefit or thing that I get excited about in terms of this new operating model is it gives us a chance to look across the organization and to really apply best practices. Most of our technologies historically are very heads down. They're dealing with a fire that's in front of them. They have a hard time looking up and looking long term. And this new operating model really puts a premium on that.</p><p>We need to be thinking about the long term for our clients and the client value that they drive. We need to be thinking about the long term for our organization. What does it mean to leverage continuous development? What does it mean to leverage the cloud? How can we build communities of excellence around artificial intelligence and machine learning and use these emerging technologies to power our business and ultimately help our clients?</p><p>So I think this operating model really helps position us in a way to be successful for the future.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: So how do you balance? I think one of the risks is that all of this sort of technology and data becomes centralized, and it sort of turns into this sort of bureaucratic process rather than something that accelerates the business. So how do you balance in this model, sharing best practices and doing those kinds of things for the benefit of everyone, but keeping technology out close to the business?</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Yes, you used 2 of my favorite words, centralization and bureaucratic -- bureaucracy, bureaucratic process, I guess it's 3 words. What we do is, we have an operating model where the technology teams are still embedded in the businesses. We don't take them out of the businesses, because again, we want them to be close to the clients. We want them to be close to the P&amp;Ls. We want them to have joint responsibility for those P&amp;Ls. Those technology teams report not only into me but they report into the presidents so that they stay focused on the business. But at the same point, they have goals and objectives set across the organization to drive that long-term growth. So to some extent, they're focused in the short to medium term within the business, getting things done, executing, driving the machine. But also looking long term to say, \"Okay, how can I leverage some of these tools, these best practices, really, to put us in a better position for the long term?\" So it's that short-term focus, having those goals, having those objectives aligned with the business, and then that long-term focus with goals and objectives for S&amp;P Global.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: And I think we've found that there are a lot of shared challenges within the divisions. And if we can raise these things up and reuse code and reuse...</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Absolutely, yes.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: reuse applications, then we can just do things a lot more efficiently, and we talked about that earlier.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Absolutely.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Great. So Daniel, coming from Kensho, I guess, tell us, why S&amp;P? Why was this a good home for you and your talented colleagues?</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, KENSHO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Sure. So one of the things that you hear a lot, maybe some of you've heard this phrase, is that data is the new oil. Whenever I say that, the Platts guys get very excited. And so if you think about Kensho and what Kensho is and what motivates our talent, Kensho was a company, when it was independent, that had built some of the best oil refinement and extraction technology in the world but controlled almost none of the world's oil. And we saw S&amp;P as this company that was, in this very special moment, analogous, for those of you who know your oil history, to where Texas was at the turn of the 20th century, sitting on top of some of the most vast oil reserves in the world, but with almost none of it having been tapped and refined by data science. So for us, that was just a very, very attractive moment and a very attractive partnership. The other thing to keep in mind is that this wasn't a blind date. So if you look at what makes a lot of acquisitions not so successful, especially among my colleagues in California, it's a big company, finds very, very sexy company, acquires it, knows really nothing about it, the company knows really nothing about the acquirer. And then, day 1, they get together and it's like, \"So what do you do? Wait, what do you do? Why'd we acquire you? Why'd we join you?\" Right? And it was the opposite in this case, where we had worked together for about 18 months prior to the acquisition. S&amp;P was our largest -- both investor and our largest customer by the time of the acquisition. And we had spent the previous 18 months before the acquisition working on one of the hardest and most attractive problems to us, which is natural language search engine capability across the S&amp;P platform. So this wasn't a blind date. It was something that, once day 1 occurred, it was really just a continuation of day 400, day 500. And that's something that was attractive to me and my team and made it very successful.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: So in the context of the operating model that Nick just talked about, what's Kensho's role in that going forward? And how do you engage with the divisions to help them solve problems?</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: Well, our role is making you guys look good. But if you -- we're at a moment historically, where every Fortune 500 company talks about technology obsessively. But if you look really closely, a lot of these companies are paying lip service to it because, practically, at most it means let's make our teleconferencing equipment work. And it doesn't really mean anything innovative. And I think, to look at how do you have a Fortune 500 company, a 150-year-old-plus company, truly innovate, the gold standard historically is Xerox PARC. Xerox PARC, many of you probably know this, is where the graphical user interface was developed. Basically, all the technology that made the personal computer possible today came out of Xerox PARC. And Xerox PARC never would have succeeded if all the technology people at Xerox were improving photocopiers, right? What they had to do is they had to segment away a subset of them and say to them, \"Look, we have a lot of people tweaking the photocopier, but we want you guys to really just figure out 25-year horizon technology, and we don't even know what it is, and we don't really even -- we can't even give you the mandate to say develop this or develop that, because it's really something that you need to see over the horizon and do.\" And so what made Xerox PARC work was a cultural independence, a little bit of operational independence, and that's the model that we're pursuing here.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Great. So you guys are going to engage to help us make much bigger leaps in technology than, frankly, we would've been able to do on our own, which makes good sense. So let's get into that. Let's start talking about some specifics here about, you mentioned, Daniel, some work that had been done over 18 months leading up to the deal. I think when we think about artificial intelligence, we think about injecting these technologies, one of the first places people go is, how do we use this to drive productivity gains? How do we use this to replace manual -- human labor, human capital with technology? So let's talk about a few of those things first. Nick, maybe you can talk about where we've seen opportunities to use Kensho technology to drive efficiency in the business.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Yes. And as you mentioned earlier and we've talked a little bit about, we have a large data operations team. We cover millions of companies around the world. We have thousands of analysts out there doing that work, and they can't do it without technology. If we had to do everything manually, there would be no way to meet our timeliness goals, drive the kind of quality that's expected in the industry and continue to drive growth. And so we -- we're constantly looking at ways to automate what we do, to use bots for what we do. We already have hundreds of bots in production. We kid with our analysts that it's \"bring your bot to work\" day. So that you have your bot sitting alongside of you as you're doing your job. And so we're looking at individual problems where technology can solve that problem. And we always test ourselves. We really feel embarrassed if we can't automate something, if we can't use these newer technologies. And one example that we were struggling with for a while, where we really were having a hard time, was something that occurs right at the beginning of the data collection process. And that is, when we bring new content into the system, the first thing we have to do is, we have to take the entities for that content, and we have to look them up in our system and try to figure out, do those entities exist? And if they do, we have to link it together. Because as we've talked about quite a bit today, linking content really unlocks a lot of the value, a lot of those insights. And so as we link those entities, it would seem pretty simple in a public company world. Everybody has an identifier, works great. But as you start to look at assets, as you start to look at private companies, as an example, it gets pretty murky. And this was a challenge where we continued to look at ways to try to automate that process, and it's very, very hard. And when you're talking about adding 100,000 companies, it's a few months. When you're talking about adding 55 million to 100 million companies, it becomes a problem that's really impossible to solve. And then along comes Kensho. And Daniel and I were talking about some different things, and I think we were actually talking about omnisearch at the time, and we said, \"Hey, this algorithm, this is really cool. Could we apply it to this entity-linking problem?\" And he said, \"Well, not sure. Let's try it.\" And we were able to apply it. Somebody mentioned earlier Crunchbase. We were able to automate the entity-linking process for Crunchbase. We took it from a process that should've taken 9 to 12 months down to a few days. And it made the impossible, possible. We're now taking that same technology and we're using it to cycle through private companies from the various registries around the world. And over the coming months and years, we look to add another almost 100 million companies, which, for some of the other products we've talked about, and you talk about extending credit lower into small- to medium-sized enterprises, that type of thing is critically important. Having those private companies is a must, and we couldn't have done it without...</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: And that makes really -- that makes technology really concrete and practical, because for many people, it's very abstract. But time to market matters. Time to market matters to the customers.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Absolutely.</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: We're not in a static world in terms of data. The amount of data is doubling every month, right? So for a company to even come up with a way to ingest all the data that's simply being added, never mind the data that it no longer -- has never included in the first place, would be trying to race as fast you can on a treadmill unless you use technology. And I think that's really illustrated, because people have this big misconception with respect to technology that everything comes down to cost, especially in the area of machine learning and AI. And to me, that's as mistaken as the notion that, well, the advantage of drones is that you save money on pilots. Well, that sort of misses the point, right? Drones can fly into mine shafts, right? No amount of pilots can -- no pilot can do that no matter what they cost. And so what Nick discussed is an example of something that you would never even undertake it in the first place. If you wanted to ingest every single private company in the world in real time and then add the new ones as they're being added, because companies are popping up every day, it's not a matter of, well, does it take 5,000 or 10,000 or 15,000 humans? You're talking about something with 5 trillion possible combinations and matches per geographical region. So that's an example of something where technology simply unlocks the possibility of bringing to market a new type of data that would never have been brought to market in the first place.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: So yes, those are great examples. So that's maybe on efficiency and time to market. Let's talk about a few things that you guys are working on around customer experience itself. And you mentioned natural language search. So talk to us about how that -- what we think is possible there, what we're working on, and how the sort of technology teams and arms work together on something like that.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Yes, I think it starts with the S&amp;P Global platform that's been mentioned a few times. It's a great tool for integrating a lot of content and solving many business problems. But one of the challenges, when you have a vast tool like that with so much content, is how do I find things? One of the questions we get asked quite a bit when we're out meeting with clients, they'll ask us, \"Do you have X?\" And yes, we have it, but they can't find it. And natural language processing and a search capability like omnisearch can unlock that. Go -- being able to go into the product now and ask very simply, show me all of the hotel properties that Hilton owns, and they pop up and I have them and I have data associated with them is much easier than trying to learn which menus to click on and where do I go. And this was, again -- I think what's nice about the partnership that we have is we think of things through a business-problem type of a lens. And when you sit down and you think of all of the problems you can solve with search, it's pretty exciting, because nothing like this really exists in the market today.</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: Yes, this is an area where we're first to market, we as S&amp;P, because just to put it bluntly, all financial information companies, including some of the competitors who were mentioned here today, have a millennials problem. Millennials are not just something that media...</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: And you look like you understand something...</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: I know something about this millennials issue. And I can speak personally that millennials, on behalf of my demographic and I'll speak personally, probably won't tolerate for very long such a discrepancy between the way they experience technology in their personal lives and the way they experience technology at work, right? So 2/3 of financial professionals today are millennials. As a refresher, these are people who grew up not knowing what it was like to not have the internet, not knowing what it was like to not even have Google, right? And so they go home and their lives are so easy at home. They use natural spoken-language questions to access information. And then they have to go to work and try to remember the function key and the short key and the shortcut to get at that information, if it even gets them at that information, and most of it is still buried. So there's such an opportunity now because there's this discrepancy between their personal lives and their work life. And the first company that can close that gap, I think, will actually capture the millennials market. There was -- one of our competitors, you could argue, in the '80s, had captured an entire generation of financial professionals. I think there's an equally sized opportunity right now for S&amp;P Global to capture the entire generation of financial professionals that the millennials represent if we can give them natural language search, if we can give them natural language ways of asking questions and calling up information. And that's something that's super strategic and existential for us as a company collectively that we're going to be working on together and are working on together.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: And I suppose if you can marry together sort of an evolved user interface that takes advantage of the way that most people work in their consumer lives and then you can actually inject it with much broader and deeper content that actually lets you ask and answer more questions, then we'd really be onto something.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Right.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Cool. All right. We just have a few minutes left. Maybe just talk about other things that are on the road map that we've dug into or not. Couple of things that you might be excited about. Daniel, why don't you start?</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: Sure. Well, as John mentioned, one of the things we're really excited about is the ratings space. Obviously, that's something that we have to look at with all deliberate speed, because it is so complex and it is regulated. But as John mentioned, there's -- the entire surveillance exercise is something that is very costly, very human-centric and very much about pattern recognition. And that's something where you're never going to quite have an algorithm replace a human, but it could be a lot like a heads-up display in a fighter pilot cockpit, where you're giving a small, elite group of analysts the ability to identify when a change in a set of economic or other variables has occurred that in the past would've led them to reevaluate a ratings decision. The other thing that we're really excited about in the ratings space is alternative credit metrics. Using alternative data, things that are perhaps leading to the traditional economic data that typically goes into a ratings decision and making sure that S&amp;P Global is first-to-market to include those types of variables. Both of those things are things we're actively working on right now. These are not speculative. So those are very exciting for us, yes.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: And we've got an example of that, I think, out in the showcases. Maybe, Nick, we've got 1 minute left.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Yes. So I think what excites me the most, and Daniel and I have talked about this, it's the next frontier of data. You -- we keep using the term alternative data, and there are different forms of alternative data. But one in particular that I think would be very interesting to the financial markets is the Internet of Things data, IoT data. If you could understand better with the use of devices, the shelf life of devices, take all of that sensor data that sits in devices and bring it back, synthesize it, clean it and link it back to more conventional data about the companies, you could gain some really informative insights into potential performance, potential credit risk, et cetera. And so it's a -- that's a very big space. It's very fragmented today, and it's actually really well suited for what we do in the data company, taking very complex data sets that are fragmented, not very clean, bringing them in, linking them, cleaning them and putting them in a relevant format.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: And then beyond the linking, then using machine learning and AI technologies to actually figure out what the insights are and all of that...</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Just pulling the insights out of it. Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Fantastic. All right. We're out of time. Nick, Daniel, thanks for joining us.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Great.</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: Thanks.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Right there. In the middle. Microphones? Great. You okay? This way. Okay, yes. Okay. Thank you. Sorry.</p><p>JEFFREY DANIEL GOLDSTEIN, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jeff Goldstein, Morgan Stanley. This question is for John. Maybe we're going to get to this in the financials section, but just on margins, I know the number that's been out there for a while is low 50s in your business. I'm just curious, long term, you've been talking about a lot of initiatives here, you just went through Project Simplify, but it seems like you have some longer runway. So just how should we be thinking about the long-term margins in that [segment] ?</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: No, our strat plan is -- and our initiatives inside of our strat plan are designed to drive some margin expansion. You're not going to see the kind of margin expansion that you saw over the last couple of years, but these initiatives are, in fact, designed to do that. When we think about uses of technology, ultimately, we don't know quite how to harvest the value of that yet, because it's early days, but it could be either in the form of productivity or it could be creating capacity to chase more growth. So give us a little bit of time to sort that out, what to do with the capacity we create, but we're going to create capacity. And in the short term, I think we've got room to run on margins. And let us develop how to use the excess capacity over the next couple of years, and we'll be over -- we'll be able, over time, to give you better answers to that. But we can extend margins.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Shlomo?</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. This also a question for John. How do you think about the risks of expanding into China? This time last year, Moody's got slapped with a fine for a report that actually would be considered a normal report here in the United States about a lot of the companies that were over there. And just balancing the need to be open with the investors together with the sensitivity that they have in China with not necessarily wanting to be so open, how are you going to deal with that?</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: I think we're -- it's going to have to be a slow build over time. Here's what I'm encouraged by: We have rich, intimate dialogue with the PBOC and the [AFNI] who's been appointed as the rating agency regulator, and we're going to continue that dialogue. The second is, I think -- there are 3 secrets to getting into China in my view: having the right talent, having the right analytical path forward and having the right technological enablement. But we're going to have to make sure that we have the right migration plan analytically. I said in my presentation, we have to be sensitive to not being overly disruptive to the Chinese market because it's built the way it's built. But we think their objectives of attracting foreign investment into the market are real. We think we can play that role. And I'm -- and so the other thing I think greenfield gives us is, if we're wrong about any of that, we can be agile, right? I mean the investments are a lot less than buying a domestic rating agency. And so I think it allows us to kind of pivot. And if we get uncomfortable with the risk, we'll address that.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Over here.</p><p>JOHN ANDREW HEAGERTY, RESEARCH ANALYST, ATLANTIC EQUITIES LLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: John Heagerty from Atlantic Equities. Also for John, sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You guys can actually take...</p><p>JOHN ANDREW HEAGERTY: On China. So I was just very interested, firstly, on how you'll square the circle between the China rating scale and the global rating scale. Is that something which will be problematic, I mean, for a while? And also just on the ambitions, sort of medium-term, long-term size of that market, because it's always been a huge untapped potential. But will it ever have a real sort of meaningful impact on revenues?</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: Yes, let me start with the latter half of that. China cross-border -- our cross-border China business is actually quite big today. And it's a sizable contributor, a meaningful contributor to both the top line and the bottom line, and we think that the growth potential for China, both cross-border and domestically, is actually quite large. It almost has to be, given this -- the overall size of the bond market. It's the third largest bond market in the world. I think the trick is, is getting the analytics right, right? I mean how do we account for the domestic scale and, over the course of time, converge? I don't know that we've got the perfect answer because we don't have perfect data yet. We've got to, I think, get our arms around what the existing ratings look like, get more private, public company data and sort that out. But we're -- our analytical teams are confident that we can do that, and that we can do it well. And I think the final equation is, winding that up with the right talent and making sure that not just domestically in China but in Greater China, that we have the right resources and that they're senior enough and can handle that volume is the secret. But look, we spent the last year looking at this from every angle, and we're quite confident we can navigate it.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay. Let's go with, [Carl], over there. Vincent.</p><p>VINCENT HUNG, PARTNER, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Just a question for John. So once you've finished implementing Project Simplify and augmented intelligence, et cetera, are you expecting a big uplift in productivity in terms of the number of credits that can be rated per analyst? Or should this be reflected in the quality of the actual analysis?</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: I would think about it as we are quite confident that this suite of technology and data initiatives create capacity. And then the question is, does that get converted into productivity or is there a way to use that capacity to chase other forms of growth? I think it's too early to say, but whether that capacity gets converted into actual productivity or whether it gets used in other ways. But we're confident that these initiatives create capacity.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: So John will be back in the final Q&amp;A. So let's have a question not for John. Right here.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: Ask Daniel Nadler if he owns a tie. Somebody ask that question. This is like -- yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: This is, I think, a question for Mike. So this is just around the data kind of acquisition strategy. I mean, it sounds like, from what a lot of you guys are talking about, there's opportunities in alternative or alternative credit data. And it seemed like, with the presentation before, there's opportunities, at least in the private company space or serving corporates. So I'm just curious, is there any change of what you have to do to get that kind of data? Or would you have to acquire that data or are you kind of -- you already have that already?</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Certainly, there's a data acquisition component to all the things that we've been talking about. I think what -- I think where we want to go -- and much of this stuff is available. Some of it, depending on the provider, it might be a licensing arrangement. There's still lots of data available from governments around private companies that we're just not ingesting today. So all of it needs to be acquired. There are different methods and different arrangements for doing that. But I think what we're enthusiastic about is that the single biggest governor, historically, on being able to put new content into the product was -- often it was manual, so i.e., expensive over time. And the level of effort was such that getting to market -- I mean, these would be multiyear projects to put something significant into the market. That'll probably still be the case for certain nuanced data that still requires a lot of human intervention. But for a lot of these larger data sets that are on our priority list, we think it just accelerates our ability to do more of them simultaneously and get them to market quicker. So that's where the opportunity lies.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay. Let's go very front row here.</p><p>COLIN R. DUCHARME, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EQUITY OPPORTUNITIES &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, STERLING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC: Actually -- Colin Ducharme from Sterling Capital -- I have a question for Nick and Daniel. Curious, over like a 3- to 5-year time frame, as you integrate Kensho's expertise into the broader S&amp;P franchise, specifically how are you going to measure success? And if you put yourself in our seats as investors and analysts, what would you recommend we look to, that Kensho is indeed achieving traction across the franchise?</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: It's very kind of you to ask that. I'm going to give it to John.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: I'm not answering it, because then Ewout will just give me a target, so.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: That's right.</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: Look, so I cited Xerox PARC as kind of just one historical template, but I think one of the things that, that illustrates is new product innovation, new products to market as a metric for success. Because the role of an institution like Kensho within S&amp;P Global is not to make incremental or marginal improvements to the photocopier. There are people doing that, and they should be doing that, and I'm not trying to diminish that in any way, but our role is to ensure that there are completely new and unprecedented ways of interfacing with S&amp;P that are now possible because we're in the organization. We cited one example, which is natural language search. So a very concrete thing that you should hold us to is, in the quarters ahead, does it become easier to discover what you're looking for in the S&amp;P Global platform that's getting created? If it's still very difficult and you're pulling your hair and you can't really get at what -- then we're not succeeding. Conversely, if you can actually not only find what you're looking for but have the recurring experience of, \"Wait, S&amp;P has that data set? I didn't even know they had that data set.\" Right? Think about what that does for renewal rates. Think about what that does for stickiness with the platform. And so that's how -- that's part of the way that I think about it.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Yes. No, exactly. I think it's going to be through new product, additions to the product suite driving new solutions out in the marketplace. And it'll be up to the businesses to then commercialize that and drive that with customers. But I think you should hold us to coming up with new solutions and really changing the trajectory.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Down here in front, Manav.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Manav Patnaik with Barclays again. Alex, a question for you. Maybe it was just a factor of time, but do you think -- you guys already run a pretty lean and efficient operation there, but do you think Kensho and these technologies that everyone's talking about has some added value for the index franchise, and how so? And then just for Daniel and Nick, I know you talked about IoT, but broadly, if you're thinking about even bigger picture, like is this aspiration to get more data, is that more taking your Kensho technology and structuring the unstructured data? Or do you have to go out and acquire a bunch of data sets?</p><p>ALEXANDER J. MATTURRI: So first of all, Kensho actually had already started developing indices that they were actually licensing out, and so that's something that we'll be taking over. Traditionally, when we've looked at doing something like a sector thematic, the way you looked at it was much more based on something like [kicks], right? Very rigid. Through their technology, you can get at purer answers. So new ways of looking at subsegments of the market that are more accurately representing what investors want. So I think that's the interesting opportunity. So it's just a matter of time as we start to work that through from the transition side.</p><p>NICHOLAS D. CAFFERILLO: Right. And I would just say, from a data perspective, I think it's going to be a little bit of a combination. Where we've been really successful, it's not buy or build, it's a little bit of both. Where we acquire some of the data sets, we marry those with maybe some conventional data sets we already have. We have really great acquisition capabilities internally to take on new data items. And so you sort of marry all of those capabilities together to arrive not just at a new dataset but, ultimately, to arrive at an insight that somebody can act on. Because our users want answers. And so some of that, if you were on the showcase and you saw the commercial real estate example, it's a combination of data from S&amp;P, data that we acquired from other sources and then some insights that we could provide using these techniques. So it's not one-size-fits-all. It's going to be really a combination.</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: Yes. As Nick and Mike said, the challenge often is not acquiring it. Many of these datasets are free and in the public domain. To use a very concrete example, let's say you wanted to analyze what the effect of a Category 3 hurricane was on oil markets, or on various sectors of the energy space, and you want to know well, when were all the Category 3 hurricane landfalls in the United States. That's on the NOAA, which is like a federal agency's website, but it's embedded in the JavaScript. And so what you have at banks are junior analysts going there, manually writing it down or copying it into Excel, trying to create a clean date list of when all the Category 3 hurricanes were, so that they can then do an analysis in (inaudible) or Stata that they give to the quants to run that against energy price movements. So that's an example of something that's free, but it's, to -- as was implicit in your question, it's unstructured. It's lightly structured. The ability to bring structure to that type of data and then to have the analyst just say in natural language, whenever there's a Category 3 hurricane landfall in the United States, tell me what happens to oil prices in the next 3 days. That's the future, right? That's what we're going for, and that's less about the cost of this data to acquire and much more about bringing structure to unstructured data.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Great. Bill, over here?</p><p>WILLIAM ARTHUR WARMINGTON, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. So a question for Alex. You described some of the success you've had expanding internationally by partnering with some of the local exchanges. And has this been taking share? Or could it take share from MSCI? Or are we talking about 2 different capital pools?</p><p>ALEXANDER J. MATTURRI: It's actually 2 different strategies. So our strategy is to be the local index in the local market, where their strategy is to be a global provider. So if you go to Canada, if you go to India, if you go to Australia, if you're a local investor in those markets, you're using our indices. The same investors may use somebody else's indices for their international -- they're outside of their home country. So it's, I would say, opposite of their strategy.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay. Final question. It has to be for either Daniel or Nick, because you're not going to see them again. Is there a question for Daniel or Nick? Right here.</p><p>CONOR BURKE FITZGERALD: Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. Just a big-picture question on whether you think it's possible to create a sustainable, competitive advantage with artificial intelligence, or do you think this is something that, over time, the market commoditizes?</p><p>DANIEL J. NADLER: I think, precisely because, over time, the market commoditizes artificial intelligence, the sustainable competitive advantage is when you marry it with data that's very hard to acquire. And as I mentioned, that was the rationale for the acquisition because, yes, we were first to market with AI in the financial space, but you're right, all things tend toward this type of commoditization. But you take that first-to-market technology and you marry it with a 150-year-old company that has all this long-range history and long-range data, and I think that creates a very, very robust moat, and that's what we did.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Great. Let's turn now to our final speaker. Thank you all.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: So -- and probably the best presentation, Ewout Steenbergen.</p><p>EWOUT LUCIEN STEENBERGEN, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, S&amp;P GLOBAL INC.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Earlier, you heard from Doug about our new strategic framework. You heard from our business leaders about our plans to continue to develop and grow our businesses. You heard from our technology leaders about our aspirations with respect to innovation and the implementation of new technologies in our business models. And you heard from Martina about some of the cross-enterprise strategies, particularly with respect to ESG. In my section, I would like to bring that all together and particularly focus on the question, how are we going to create shareholder value in the future?</p><p>I will focus on our operational leverage, our financial leverage, our capital management approach. I will give you some insight, in case of a stress situation, the resilience of our business model. I want to give you some insight in our valuation models and what those tell you, our financial projections. And then, ultimately, how that translates in aspirational new financial targets for the company.</p><p>So let's first look at the last 5 years back. Of course, a very remarkable transformation of the portfolio. And you have seen all the different divestitures and acquisitions. You're very much aware of those. I particularly would like to point out some of the acquisitions, the formation of the joint venture between S&amp;P and Dow Jones Indices, of course, SNL already mentioned, and more recently Kensho.</p><p>And if we look at the performance over this period, the operating profit margin has seen an increase of 33% to 47%. And also, the total shareholder return has done very well on a relative basis. Clearly outperforming the overall market, the S&amp;P 500, but also clearly outperforming the peer group. Recently, we were recognized by the Drucker Institute. And this is a new ranking, a new ranking that is following the core principles of Peter Drucker. And those core principles are around customer satisfaction, employee engagement, innovation about the financial strength, and also our social responsibility. And if you look at the overall ranking, and it's almost 700 companies, S&amp;P global is ranked #16th. But with respect to financial strength, we are actually ranked #2, only behind Apple. And you see some of the key metrics on the left-hand side here.</p><p>So we're clearly anchored in a position of strength. If it is about our motivated employees, our clear strategy, our operating model around operational excellence, but I would like also to point out particularly our capital-light business model. This is very important because we can grow a lot, S&amp;P Global, in the future, and that doesn't require a lot of capital going forward.</p><p>So if you think about the future and think about that strength, that is really helping us to make very specific investments. And I think, particularly investment in technology are important. And given the theme of today, I wanted to show you more insight in the overall spend in technology for the company. And what you see is, over the last 2 years, technology spend has come down slightly to $740 million, just under 25% of our overall expense base. But more importantly, you see a very important shift in the composition of the spend. 2 years ago, we spent far more on what is called run the business, which means more the day-to-day maintenance, running of the networks and the applications. But we have made a very large shift. A large shift through working more in an agile way, taking complexity out of our environment. And now we're spending much more on transformational technologies, also called change the business. So investments in the new platform, as Mike already explained, other commercial strategies, and of course, Kensho is also a part of that.</p><p>If you think about creating shareholder value, we are thinking about 4 main components. The first is what we would call operational leverage, the third, financial leverage, and the last one is what we would call our capital management approach. And over the next few minutes, I will go in more detail in each of these areas.</p><p>So let's think about the revenue momentum we have as a company. You heard a lot of the plans of the business leaders. I will put them in many different categories. We have our commercial productivity. We have new logos, new markets, new products, but we also have, in Ratings, our issuance growth; we have in Platts, the growth of the trading volumes; we have in our Indices business, growth of exchange-traded derivative volumes. So overall, together, I would say it is not one single lever here that will drive our revenue growth in the future. A combination of all of these will ultimately drive our revenue growth as a company and you see here, in the mid- to high single-digit range.</p><p>Then the next category with respect to our shareholder value creation is the EBITDA enhancements. Today, we are announcing a new cost reduction program of $100 million to $115 million. And that is on top of already run rate saving programs that we have introduced in the second half of last year at the level of $65 million. The $65 million, you have seen in some of the restructuring charges we have taken in the third and the fourth quarter of 2017. The $100 million to $115 million new efficiency program, we have found these after many months of looking very deeply at our organization, at processes and at other opportunities and a lot of benchmarking work we have done.</p><p>And the main categories here are as follows. In our support functions, we see a lot of opportunity for standardization, for centralization to centers of excellence, to the implementation of automation. Think about our invoice processing. There's a lot of opportunity for automation there to do the accounts payable in a more efficient way. With respect to our real estate, we have a large and expensive real estate about -- real estate footprint around the world, and there's certainly -- also, there are excess real estate. So we're planning to reduce that over time, and that will also lead to expense reductions. And then the last is in the area of our digital infrastructure organization. We have a new approach with respect to sourcing. We're looking at moving more to the cloud data center integration. And all of those combined will lead to that $100 million to $115 million expense reduction over the next 3 years, and we have a very high level of commitment and conviction around that.</p><p>Then the third component of shareholder value creation is our financial leverage. You see here the borrowing cost. We will continue to manage that at attractive levels. Our effective tax rate is coming down a lot this year. We will continue with finding tax planning strategies to continue to manage that. Our overall outstanding shares are coming down, and therefore, the EPS is going up. This year, approximately 23% to 25%, and that is consistent with the guidance in dollar terms we have provided to you. So today, we are affirming that particular EPS guidance for 2018.</p><p>And then the last area is our capital management approach. Capital management, in our view, starts with free cash flow generation. We are generating a lot of free cash flow, and in fact, that has gone up in a very healthy way over the last few years. At 5 years ago, $1.3 billion, to this year, approximately $2.3 billion and with a very nice increase between 2017 and 2018. And what do we do with that free cash flow? We are actively returning that to our shareholders, on average over the last 5 years, at a level of 71%. And that is adjusted for the proceeds of some of the divestitures we have done over those years, and you see here also how we have distributed that in the sense of share buybacks and dividends.</p><p>We have a clear framework with respect to our capital philosophy and targets going forward. And we have explained that to you last year, and let me tell you again about some of the key components. On the one hand, a continued commitment to return capital to shareholders. At least 75% of our free cash flow generation, we will return to shareholders. We'll do that through disciplined buybacks, but we'll also do that through our dividends and dividend growth. We have been growing our dividend over the last 45 years. So we're one of the so-called dividend aristocrats in the market, and we clearly are planning to continue to do that as well. But then, on the other hand, we have a prudent and flexible balance sheet. We like our balance sheet with a lot of room to maneuver. We think that can be attractive at the right point in time. So we certainly will continue with the balance sheet on that basis.</p><p>We have that high level of conviction around our capital distribution and capital management framework because of the resilience of our business model. We do a lot of stress testing of our financials for moderate to severe short-term stresses. And the impact of that is overall relatively modest, certainly taking into account some of our variable expenses that we can adjust as well.</p><p>And why is that the case? If you look at the sources of our revenues, in fact, there is a very large component that is subscription-based, nontransaction-based, asset-linked-based. That is the dark blue part over here, the bar graphs you see here, on the slide. But then if you look at Ratings transaction, in our view, there is also a very solid component in Ratings transaction. That is the shaded part in the Ratings bar. And the reason is there will always be a lot of refinancing that needs to happen in the market. Over the next 5 years, $10.2 trillion of corporate debt is set to mature. $10.2 trillion. That is not going away. That needs to be refinanced. So in fact, therefore, it is a very solid part in the Ratings transaction revenue. So if you add it all up, 71% of our revenue is subscription, non-transaction based. The 25% is Ratings transaction and 4% we would call that in the category of non-Ratings, non-subscription.</p><p>To give you some other examples of our resilience of our business models, you see Ratings corporate revenue up over the last 10 years despite very different cycles in terms of the economy of the last 10 years, and John already explained, mostly directly correlated with GDP. We've seen the stickiness of our Market Intelligence business going up, the renewal rates are every year getting better. We have seen Platts doing well in difficult commodity markets over the last few years. And then if you look at the revenue of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, also up each and every year, although we have seen cycles with respect to assets under management growth. But you if you look at the yellow line, the exchange-traded derivative volumes, there is a kind of nice natural offset. There is a bit of a natural hedge in that business as well. So those are some of the examples around the resilience of our overall business model.</p><p>With respect to our valuation models, we are developing those models with some outside help to try to understand the correlation between the levers that we can pull as a company and what creates most shareholder value in the future. And the conclusion of those models is very interesting because it's showing that revenue growth is by far the most important element. In fact, what it is telling is, 1 percent point improvement of our top line growth creates 5x more value than 1 percent point of margin expansion on our businesses. And that's because our margins in our businesses are already so high, so growing those businesses as fast as we can is clearly the most important. So that's why we have a very clear commitment to grow at least in line with market, or better, as a company going forward.</p><p>But we also have that efficiency opportunity. So if I think about what we can do is a part of the efficiency opportunity can reinvest in the company to accelerate future growth, and a part of that can flow to the bottom line. So in other words, we can grow our top line and still have an expense line that is growing 1% to 2% less than our top line and therefore, seeing some margin expansion at the same time.</p><p>So therefore, our medium-term outlook is that we can grow organically our revenues in mid- to high single digits and, at the same time, be able to have a margin expansion in all of our businesses. So our new aspirational medium term, which is 3 to 4 years, medium-term aspirational margin targets for the company are as follows. For Ratings, and that was the question that was asked earlier, we're setting high 50s; for Market Intelligence, mid- to high 30s; for Platts, low 50s; and for Indices, mid- to high 60s; for the overall company, margin of low '50s. I do want to point out that the path to those aspirational margin targets won't be linear. There will be fluctuation over time, but we're clearly very committed to get to those aspirational margin targets over the next few years.</p><p>So in conclusion, Doug explained to you our new strategic framework. Our 6 foundational capabilities, how we're going to develop that further in the future, how we're going to evolve and grow our core businesses and how we are going to expand into adjacencies. You heard from our business leaders, our technology leaders around our AI-driven innovation, our plans with respect to new products, new markets. You heard about cross-enterprise opportunities, and I explained to you some of our operational and financial leverage. And that all translates in our medium-term new financial targets with respect to high -- to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, low double-digit EPS growth and a continued commitment to return at least 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the future.</p><p>Thank you so much for your attention. We're getting some of the chairs back on stage, and I would like to invite Doug and the business presidents for the last Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: So I think we've got a chance here to help the sell side. I keep reading that they're going to be under pressure in a post-MiFID II environment. So let's let them sweat for a minute, and I'm only going to take the first 3 questions from someone who's an investor on the buy side. So first 3 questions, no sell side. After that, we'll open it back up. Okay? So you guys step up your game here. You have to be quiet. Right here.</p><p>COLIN R. DUCHARME: Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. I'm sorry, John. I'll go back to China here just for one moment. Just wanted to generally understand the longer-term prospect for that market, and specifically just probe it along 3 dimensions. I'm just curious, based on your observation, how issuance pricing compares versus developed markets today. Secondarily, I'm just curious, in terms of the analytical kind of legwork that goes into creating those ratings, how much of that information today is digitized and able to be automated? Can you achieve the automation that you currently have in the developed markets? And then, finally, if you could just touch on the level of disintermediation there and the trends as you see them going forward.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: Yes. So the first thing to remind you of is that our cross-border business is quite big and very profitable, right? And so in the domestic markets, you should expect -- we should see revenue growth, but we're not expecting profit growth for a while, right? It's a slow build as we think about how to approach the market analytically. Some of the data is -- I mean, actually, the MI team probably could talk about a little bit of the data. Data is a concern of ours, in that we're not buying a domestic rating agency, and so we're going to have to find other ways to get that data other than what's publicly available on the ratings. And the thing that gives us confidence on the disintermediation in the market is China's stated policy of opening up the market. And we're seeing some of those trends. I don't have those numbers handy, but those would be my answers. You guys have anything to add on the data side?</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Yes, I want to add something, which is that every one of us has been in China, including Martina, frequently over the last couple of years. And we're very excited about the Chinese financial markets, commodity markets, generally. And one of the best ways in is going in with this golden opportunity we have, where we've been given an opportunity to own 100% of a rating agency. So it's a fantastic way to get into the market, but all of us here are very excited about the entirety of the Chinese market, but it's going to be a slow build.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: [Lori], right there in front of you, in the pink.</p><p>BOGDAN COSMACIUC: This is Bogdan Cosmaciuc with Senator Investment Group. Question on -- maybe for Ewout on financial targets. So -- and thanks for providing that sensitivity to a potential slowdown or downturn. That's very helpful. If that downturn, let's say, happens in the next 3 or 4 years, so during this -- during your planning horizon, can you still hit those margin targets? Or are you basically thinking, we're going to hit the low end of those targets? Can you hit the midpoint? In other words, do you need to see a continuation of the current economic environment throughout this planning cycle to hit those targets?</p><p>EWOUT LUCIEN STEENBERGEN: Yes. My answer on that would be very much, it depends on the type of market downturn situation. If it is a relatively shorter downturn situation, that is mostly where we have done a lot of the stresses. Those are more the short term, and moderate to severe stresses. And I would say that we are clearly still being able, with respect to impact, deal with that and continue with those financial targets. If you're looking at a long-term downturn, where at some point, for example in the subscription business, we will see an impact on renewal rates over a longer period of time, I think, then those targets would probably shift a bit further out in the future.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Great. And one more buy-side question. Right here.</p><p>HIMANSHU BINDAL: This is Himanshu Bindal from Rothschild Wealth Management in London. My question is for Doug and for John. I think you've got some really powerful businesses here, especially the Ratings business, but then Platts and Index as well, where you can really increase prices and do -- basically, it's hard for customers to let go of sort of those businesses as suppliers. How do you make sure that the culture stays -- culture in those businesses stays in such a way that they're still customer-oriented, that the quality of the ratings is at the highest level and so on, so forth so that the businesses not manage us for this year or the next year, but the health of the business is maximized for next 5, 10, 15 years?</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Well, first of all, it's fortunate that at the core of our culture is values. And we have values around integrity, around how we think about excellence, how we think about relevance. And we actually have a lot of dialogue about relevance and how we can ensure that what we provide to the markets is relevant and it also creates and drives value. And the culture that you talk about is one that we've spent a lot of time collectively thinking about the last few years. How we ensure that we provide the value, we're relevant in the markets, and we do it in a way that we don't have a toxic culture, where we're always driving towards a higher performance. But I think that anyone of us here would -- for all of the businesses, the risk that you talked about is something that could happen. On the customer aspect, as you saw very briefly in my opening slides, last year, we took a step back and we visited over 150 customers as part of our strategic planning. And we listened to what they felt, and I put some of those -- some of the themes that we heard back about transparency, about trust, in addition to technology or other changes going on. And we've reflected that in how we operate. But I think some other people -- and John, he asked you. I think you could also respond.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: Yes. I think the #1 input into our strategic plan was to compete on quality. The -- people write about moats around this business, and I think that's a very dangerous attitude to have. So we -- our #1 input to our strat plan was, we compete on quality. And you mentioned pricing. The way to extend the value you extract from the market is to extend the value you give. And so Ratings360 is an example of how we're not staying complacent but driving forward to add more value to the clients we serve. And if we do those 2 things, we don't get complacent because we recognize we compete on quality, and we're innovative on data content and look for ways to extend value, I think that's what we want. A high-performance place that does things the right way, but is ambition -- ambitious in its quests.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay. Let's -- Peter, welcome back.</p><p>PETER PERRY APPERT: Peter Appert from Piper. So Doug, I was hoping you'd talk a bit about M&amp;A strategy and how it fits with the 75% capital return benchmark. It seems like that, just off the top of my head, might've precluded the SNL deal. So are you putting yourselves in a little bit of a box with that? Even acknowledging that, I'm sure, there's some year-to-year flexibility. And then just really quickly for Alex, I was hoping he could talk for a sec about self-indexing and how big that is in the market now, how big a threat that is.</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Thank you, Peter. On the first part of the question, when you think about how we have the kind of capacity we have, clearly, we have capacity in our debt. If we wanted to do a larger transaction, we could always increase the amount of debt we have on our balance sheet. We also have some excess cash right now, some excess capital. So we don't feel like we should be constrained by financial -- in terms of size of a transaction, just because we are -- have the target of 75%. We really believe that we have to look at potential acquisitions based on the quality of the asset, how it fits into the overall portfolio, what it's going to drive for growth, what it's going to drive for value, how it's going to impact our approach to our shareholders. And so we look at this on very clear parameters on how acquisitions could fit our portfolio. We don't want to do anything that's outside of what -- the businesses we're already in. We've looked at international opportunities. We've looked at new product expansions. We've looked at certain technology opportunities, but we don't feel constrained by that 75%. We think we have flexibility that will allow us to do almost anything that we'd want.</p><p>ALEXANDER J. MATTURRI: All right. So self-indexing is not something that we really worry too much about, and I'll give you a couple of reasons. First of all, the big branded indices, right, the things that really drive usage are not something that's really replaceable, right? You can't replace the S&amp;P 500. You can't replace a lot of these core indices. Where you see more price competition would be more in the kind of what we'd call the fringe indices, things that our brand means a little bit less. And there, we tend to be very competitive on price. So we've got this more of a two-tiered pricing, where the premium indices are what you pay for. But when you get to, I'll use an example, a thematic -- a narrowly based thematic index, that sort of stuff, it's really not worth it for most people to try to do that on their own. The new wrinkle nowadays is actually regulation, because to meet the regulatory standards is going to start raising the barriers for a lot of people. And the regulation in Europe is pretty far reaching, and a lot of asset managers haven't really focused on it yet and what falls into that. And so again, I think that's going to be a cost of doing business for a lot of people. The big players will meet those costs. The smaller players may not be able to, certainly not worth it for them.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay. Let's go to, see, [Romanoff]? Oh, here, I'm sorry. Yes. Second row. Keep your hand up, please. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So first question is for Alex. Just in terms of the margins that Ewout set out, the mid- to high 60s, I guess. I guess my question is why can't it be more, especially when we are looking at your competitors? And then, Martin, for you. Now that Platts is finally broken out as a separate segment -- thank you for that, Ewout, how does that change your approach in managing the business discipline? Like is there a change with that breakout that comes for us, at least?</p><p>ALEXANDER J. MATTURRI: So I'll take the -- in terms of our competitor, I know who you're talking about. Their business is a different business model. They're focused on just equities. They have a much simpler index structure. They don't have the fixed income business. They're not in commodities. They're not doing partnerships with exchanges where [we're] effectively have a revenue share model approach with them. So again, it's just different businesses. The other factor, I think, in terms of where our margins can go, if you look at like what happened in the first quarter, when trading volumes shoot up, that's 100% margin business. And so there's a revenue mix element that's unique to our business compared to other index providers.</p><p>MARTIN E. FRAENKEL: So as far as Platts is concerned and the reporting -- before we were reporting, we were held to a strong financial discipline. So in that sense, I think we were probably following best practice beforehand. But transparency, obviously, brings greater accountability. So the types of things that we are thinking about are just on the expense side, particularly managing expenses over the calendar year. The types of things where in the past maybe we might have lumpy periods of expenses, we're thinking about those things to smooth, if you like, during the course of the year. But otherwise, it doesn't make a major impact.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay, [Lori], down here in front. Alex?</p><p>ALEXANDER KRAMM: Alex Kramm, UBS again. I guess for Ewout and maybe Doug. I think, Doug, you just actually mentioned that you still have a lot of excess cash, and I think it's about $1 billion. A lot of that's sitting overseas collecting dust given where rates are overseas. So it sounds to me like maybe M&amp;A is something you're earmarking that for, but at what point do you actually say, like, all right, it's just sitting around here, we need to return this to shareholders. Is there a time line? Or how are you thinking about that excess cash? And then just maybe secondly, and I think John answered some of this already, but in terms of the guidance, how much is China actually in the guidance? I mean, is some of the cost buildout in the margin guidance for Ratings? Or are you assuming any sort of revenues over the next few years? Like, how could China impact the guidance that you just laid out?</p><p>EWOUT LUCIEN STEENBERGEN: Alex, on your first question, at the end of the first quarter, we're at $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, came down from $2.8 billion at year-end. But that was because of the $1 billion ASR, and our first quarter is always the lowest in terms of cash, net cash generation. So the $1.8 billion, everything else taken -- [not in] taken into account, that should be built up again over the next few quarters. So very significant cash balance. You make a distinction between in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. In fact, we don't make that distinction anymore. For us, it's irrelevant because all of the cash is now largely unconstrained. It can be today in Europe. It can be tomorrow in Asia. It can be the day after in the U.S. and back again because of the new tax legislation that is now all unconstrained. So for us, we're not thinking about anymore in the sense of foreign cash versus U.S. cash. This is all cash that we have available. Our first priority is to reinvest those cash balances into our business. So again, a little bit of the flip side of the question of Peter. 75% of what we generate per year, we will return to our shareholders. And by the way, Peter, that means 25%, so still $600 million that's available annually to reinvest in tuck-in acquisitions or in other ways. And then we have the existing cash on the balance sheet that we would like to reinvest over time as well. I'm not going to give you a particular deadline with respect to the time before we'd like to spend that. Clearly, we hope that we have a lot of conviction, a lot of confidence from our shareholders that we are going to do the right thing with that cash balance. And I think we have proven a lot in the way how we think about acquisitions, about investments, our valuation models and the discipline we apply around it. But of course, over time, we're not going to sit on lazy cash. If it really takes a very long period of time, then we have to think about other plans as well.</p><p>ALEXANDER KRAMM: And the China part?</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: Go ahead. You answer that.</p><p>EWOUT LUCIEN STEENBERGEN: With respect to the China plan, you should think about China and how it will impact the numbers over a longer period of time. So the domestic greenfield startup that John was explaining will be incurring costs for the next few years that is probably higher than the revenues. Because we are building a new standard in the market, the revenues will grow slowly over time. But I see it really as an optionality we are creating for ourselves. And then hopefully, over time, when the market gets more mature, it's moving more to a higher-quality direction, and then we will take the benefit of it. So you have to think about this that the first time you see really significant impact in terms of our financial reporting will be multiple years out in the future. I think that it will be a fair expectation to have.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: The only thing to add to that is we do expect our cross-border business in China to grow and have real -- be accretive to our results.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Let's go down here in front. Saad?</p><p>SAAD H. SIDDIQUI, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, EDGEWOOD MANAGEMENT LLC: Saad from Edgewood Management. A question for you, Doug. We talk a lot about financial resilience, but I'd love to hear you talk about cultural resilience. And so under your stewardship, the team and the organization has basically been built anew since the last financial crisis, which is amazing because it's manifested in incredible operating performance. Conversely, do you wonder -- worry that the organization has lost some of the muscle memory of sort of withstanding that crisis? And how do you retain that given there's so much newness in the organization?</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Well, first of all, I believe that we've done a really good job of building a team and building a culture in this organization. If you go back about 2-plus years ago when we rebuilt our brand, we renamed the company S&amp;P Global. We had -- we took an opportunity to spend a lot of time as an operating committee and as a leadership team to talk about our history, to talk about our legacy. What were those strengths of our culture that had allowed us to be so successful and to deliver such strong performance? And we've built a management system in the company that starts with a vision. You've seen it today, Powering the Markets of the Future. We have a purpose around essential intelligence and delivering that so people can make decisions. And that guides how we run the company. And when you saw the framework today, that's really a management system. Our management system is built around monthly business reviews and financial reviews that Ewout does. We have a quarterly business review process, not just for the businesses, also with the functions. We do that as an operating committee. And so we've built this into the management system, into our culture, that we're going to have this vision, we're going to have values, and then we have a system that keeps us accountable on how we measure and manage that.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: I would just add, in the top 2 layers of our analytical practices and ratings, I can only think of one leader that wasn't here during the financial crisis. So while we have made change in the data and IT organizations, we have tremendous continuity in our analytical organizations and, therefore, a lot of institutional knowledge.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: [Trish], way in the back there, Teddy, middle. Okay. Yes. Right down that row.</p><p>EDWARD MOLSON, PARTNER AND INVESTMENT ANALYST, EGERTON CAPITAL (UK) LLP: It's Teddy Molson from Egerton Capital. I have 2 questions. First, for Doug. We've heard a lot about the importance of the brand. Given the importance of the brand, why -- or how are you confident that the risk of a local ratings agency in China doesn't overwhelm that? And then my second question is you've talked a lot about capacity creation in the business. Is there any way to quantify just how much capacity over the next 5 years you're going to create to invest? And do you have a feeling that this capacity should lead to a higher rate of organic revenue growth going forward?</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Well, first of all, in terms of the brand in China, our brand in China is very strong today. There is -- we have a lot of credibility. We've been -- we're already embedded in the global investors so if you go meet with any of the Chinese investors that look at global markets, they're already using our products and services. Whether it's Cap IQ, it's our ratings business, they're benchmarking to the index business, commodities companies that are using Platts prices. So we're already very embedded in the Chinese financial and markets culture, and we're starting off with a strong brand there. And when you think about a greenfield, a greenfield gives us an opportunity to start building, planting seeds and planting trees in the market, planting flags around China. It's a way that we can start slowly, start building our brand, hire the right people, have the right approach to serving the market. And we're not getting then in a company that already has a rating system that we'd have to live with, we'd have to try to change. We had a lot of discussion about this greenfield versus going with an acquisition. And the greenfield gives us an opportunity to build a business but also protect our brand. In terms of capacity, I think it would be good if maybe Mike gave us some thoughts because he's running a couple of the big operational services where a lot of that capacity is going to be coming from.</p><p>MICHAEL A. CHINN: Sure. I think certainly, capacity building is something we're all focused on. John mentioned in his presentation leveraging data-gathering assets so that it frees up capacity and allows people to do higher-level work. I guess, for me, I would think across all of the divisions, that kind of capacity building will be reinvested in a few ways. One is in higher quality in everything that we do. I think certainly in our business, John has already mentioned it, these guys may feel the same way, there's always room to do just better work and provide greater insights. Some of it should manifest itself there. Certainly, freeing up capacity and retiring some technical debt and some legacy systems should allow us to reinvest technology and software engineering horsepower into things that over the long term hopefully drive greater organic growth. I think that's a fair expectation.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: And John, just to clarify, you're not starting from scratch in China. You've got people on the ground there already.</p><p>JOHN L. BERISFORD: We do, yes. Yes, we do. We don't operate in the domestic market. But we're showing -- we're not flat-footed either. We have a presence in China and in greater China. We actually have a lot of presence in greater China. So it is not a white sheet of paper, we actually have a view.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Hamzah in the back.</p><p>HAMZAH MAZARI: Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. My question is for Doug. Doug, just on adjacencies, maybe frame for us how broad is your definition of adjacencies. And where do you see the most opportunity in the portfolio in your segments? And you don't have to pick your favorite child again, because I'm asking you to pick your favorite segment.</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Well, this theme of adjacency was -- is something that's really being driven by 2 things. One is the way that we're working together now as a team and as a company, where we have the ability to cross fertilize and move opportunities across all the divisions as well as fertilize and grow them. And then second, it comes back from the markets, when we listen to customers and we observe markets and we see what are those gaps that are being filled. When I think about adjacencies, we talked to you today about ESG, which is a combination of that, that's coming from outside and what we can do internally. Supply chain analytics and SME credit is another one that over time we're going to start doing a lot more work on. Another one which Mike alluded to today is how are we going to serve the market with our platform. So these are 3 that right off the top of my head we've started working on. When we did our strategic work last year, we actually identified many more than that, another 5 or 6 that we probably felt were either not realistic or they were too expensive to get into or they'd require a complex acquisition. So there's definitely 3 or 4 that we've started working on. In terms of the portfolio itself, I don't know how you could look at a company that has 4 stronger businesses. Just the envy that people should have for the kind of portfolio that we've constructed, and going back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, when we thought about these core concepts of being global, of building scale, of having strong brands, of being in the data and analytics, in the markets business. This is how we built the portfolio. And so we've taken businesses that started out that were excellent, and they're all better, and they're all getting better all the time. And we're even stronger now because we can work together as a group across the entire portfolio.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Great. Let's go way over here.</p><p>VINCENT HUNG: Vincent from Autonomous. So Ewout, a question for you. I think you've talked before about how there's maybe like 7,000 folks offshore entering in data, cleansing data, and that's clearly expensive and inefficient. So is that something that's being attacked within the $100 million cost-saving plan? Or is that something you can address in the future?</p><p>EWOUT LUCIEN STEENBERGEN: Thank you for that question, Vincent. I think it's very important to say today that the $100 million expense reduction program is not the only efficiency program we have running in the company. There's many more initiatives outside of that. And by the way, a part of the $65 million was announced in the third and the fourth quarter of 2017, but not all of that is in the run rate today. So there's many other areas where we can look for efficiencies, particularly based on the new technologies as Daniel and Nick have explained. So certainly, if you look at the 7,000 people in Market Intelligence in terms of the data intake, ingestion and linking, there is a lot of opportunities for efficiencies there as well. But at the same time, as we are also focused on commercial growth and revenue growth, there will be offsets to that in terms of growing the business as a whole. And hopefully, we can repurpose a lot of that capacity in the sense of additional work that we will generate in the future. And there are several examples of that already taking place today. But thank you for that question because it's important to point out that there are far more efficiency opportunities in the company than only that $100 million program. The $100 million is for the support functions, for real estate, and for our digital infrastructure areas.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Okay. And Conor, final question.</p><p>CONOR BURKE FITZGERALD: Ewout, Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. Just one more for you on your valuation model. I'm just trying to get your understanding of, if you really think there's a 5x benefit from growing revenue versus driving some operating leverage. Why put out higher operating margin targets at all? Why not reinvest every marginal dollar back into the business? Should we think about that as, even if you did, you don't think you can drive more growth? Just trying to get a sense because a 5x is a pretty low trade off.</p><p>EWOUT LUCIEN STEENBERGEN: That's really a great question, actually a question we are discussing a lot as a team because if we have those opportunities and we can make those investments, of course, we will do it. But we would also like to invest in those opportunities where there is a real business case to grow and where there is real metrics we can measure that the growth is really happening. It doesn't mean if you make the investment this year, there should be a return on investment -- invested capital next year. It could be longer out in the future. It could be a leading indicator, but we are looking for business cases where we can invest in growth. And actually, we have established a new committee, and we're all members of that new committee, that is now coming together every quarter, where we're looking at very specific cases where we can invest more in future growth in the company. And if the business case is healthy, then we will make an investment in that. And we haven't set a specific budget. If there are more business cases that we can find, we will make those investments as well. But the reality is there is a certain limit in terms of what we can do all at the same time. So therefore, what I said is there's a very large efficiency opportunity. The intention is to reinvest, but realistically, a part will flow through the bottom line so therefore -- and revenue growth and margin expansion at the same time. I don't believe that we will be in a situation longer term where we always can do both. There will be moments several years out where we have to make very explicit trade-off decisions between one versus the other. But we are in the fortunate situation that we can do both at the same time, in our view, over the next few years.</p><p>ROBERT S. MERRITT: Thanks, Ewout. So Doug is going to close this out. Let me just remind you that after Doug closes out, where you saw the showcase will be reopened. The showcase will be available. Our executives will be there and so will a cold drink. So Doug?</p><p>DOUGLAS L. PETERSON: Thank you, Chip. Well, I wanted to first of all thank all of you for either listening in or joining us today for our investor conference. As we started off, we've had a very strong run the last few years. Our performance has allowed us to return capital to our shareholders. We've improved our margins, our top line growth. We've built a very strong management team. Our strategy has been one that was sound. But over the last couple of years and especially the last year, we saw changes going on around us, which required us to take a step back and decide that we weren't going to be complacent. We weren't going to let ourselves be disrupted, and we had to try to become part of the disruptive culture that we are seeing changing business models everywhere around us. So we're very pleased today that we were able to share with you the framework that we're using for managing our strategy for implementing it. We're using that framework for allocating resources, for allocating capital, for defining how we're going to grow our business to expand into new geographies, into new product sets, how we're going to be acquiring for the future. And I'm really pleased that all of you are here today. We enjoy the interactions with the sell side and the buy side. It makes us stronger. You ask us tough questions. The tougher, the better because when we come back from meetings with you, it allows us to think about how we're going to be better. And so thank you for joining us. Thank you for being investors in our company. And I also want to end by thanking all of the people that are here in the room that made this possible. The people back here from [fusion, Celeste, Papia], all of those that made this a successful day. So again, please come join us for a drink. Go to the showcases, and we really appreciate your interest.

                  </p><p> Elon Musk's latest company Neuralink was registered in California as a 'medical research' company in July 2016. </p><p>Very little is known about the exact nature of the work being undertaken by the firm, beyond the fact it is attempting to develop 'ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers'.</p><p>Neuralink is working to link the human brain with a machine interface by creating micron-sized devices. </p><p>They will work on what Musk calls 'neural lace' technology, implanting tiny brain electrodes that may one day upload and download thoughts.</p><p>Neuralink is aiming to launch a product that will help people who suffer from serious brain injuries, as a result of disorders such as stroke and cancer, in just four years.</p><p>Musk says that the time before the devices are released depends on regulatory approval and how well they work on people with disabilities.</p><p>At a tech conference in 2016, Musk said AI and machine learning will create computers so sophisticated and godlike that humans will need to implant 'neural laces' just to keep up,</p><p>And in eight to ten years, the Matrix-style technology will be available to everyone, he believes.</p><p>Musk plans on funding the company mostly by himself. </p><p>'Elon Musk and Facebook are already trying to develop the technology portrayed in the show,' she told AFP at the Canneseries festival in the French Riviera resort.</p><p>The Tesla boss and sometime Twitter warrior 'is developing a neuro lace (computer) that covers the entire brain that you would control with thought,' Powell said.</p><p>'Facebook has been working on something similar in some place called 'Building 8' where it has all its secret projects.'</p><p>Both are very quiet about what precisely they are doing, said Powell. </p><p>However, 'people at MIT have already created something you can attach to your ear that is controlled by thought.</p><p>'It can tell you the time and how much groceries are when you walk through the aisles of a supermarket,' she added.</p><p>'The Feed' -- which will screen later this year -- is based on Nick Clark Windo's 2018 novel of the same name.</p><p>Told from inside the fabulously wealthy family who invented 'The Feed' and now effectively control the world, the story doesn't end well.</p><p>Given what we have learned about the harvesting and misuse of personal data from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and how Google can seem to predict our needs before we search for it on our smartphone, that should not be too surprising.</p><p>'We have seen dystopian shows before but never like this,' Powell insisted, who cast British actor David Thewlis as the tech guru patriarch of the seemingly well-meaning clan.</p><p>'It was a very realistic portrayal of what happens when we let technology control us -- and we are heading in that direction.</p><p>'We cannot let go of our iPhones, we need to check Instagram every hour or minute. The notion that you would put something inside your head is really frightening to me,' the 39-year-old said. </p><p>But it is where tech companies are going, she insisted, the next logical step from Google's smart glasses.</p><p>Powell said workers in some companies in Belgium and Sweden already have chips implanted in their bodies.</p><p>'What is happening around us right now is so scary. </p><p>'When somebody like Elon Musk (a radical libertarian) -- who is inside this -- is telling the government, 'You need to regulate us, and stop us from doing what we are doing', that is terrifying. Because he knows way more than we know,' she said.</p><p>                     HUMAN BRAIN WILL CONNECT TO COMPUTERS 'WITHIN DECADES'                   </p><p> In a new paper published in the Frontiers in Neuroscience, researchers embarked on an international collaboration that predicts groundbreaking developments in the world of 'Human Brain/Cloud Interface's' within the next several decades.</p><p>Using a combination of nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other more traditional computing, researchers say humans will be able to seamlessly connect their brains to a cloud of computer(s) to glean information from the internet in real-time.</p><p>According to Robert Freitas Jr., senior author of the research, a fleet of nanobots embedded in our brains would act as liaisons to humans' minds and supercomputers, to enable 'matrix style' downloading of information.</p><p>'These devices would navigate the human vasculature, cross the blood-brain barrier, and precisely autoposition themselves among, or even within brain cells,' explains Freitas.</p><p>'They would then wirelessly transmit encoded information to and from a cloud-based supercomputer network for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction.'</p><p>The interfaces wouldn't just stop at linking humans and computers, say researchers. A network of brains could also help form what they call a 'global superbrain' that would allow for collective thought.</p><p>Paranoia about new technology is nothing new, Powell admitted, dating back beyond the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>But what we are living through now, and with little or no regulation to hold tech companies back, is of a different order, she argued.</p><p>'Technology has brought us so much.... but there are also these negative undertones to it. Facebook is watching you and selling your information. </p><p>'They own Instagram and WhatsApp, and (Amazon's) Alexa is in every room of your house. Siri can pop up on your phone when you didn't even call her. You cannot ignore that side of it.'</p><p>Set in England, 'The Feed' has British actor Guy Burnet play Thewlis' psychologist son and Nina Toussaint-White his daughter-in-law.</p><p>Burnet told AFP that the series' vision of the near future 'was far from crazy... and it is amazing it hasn't been done before' when you see Beijing's plans for its social credit system.</p><p>From next year all Chinese citizens will be ranked and either punished or rewarded according to their 'social credit' score.</p><p>'I think we're not on the precipice, we may have already passed it,' the actor warned.</p><p>In 'The Feed', a handful of people control the code on which the world relies, and it is they, said Powell, who get to decide what the public need to know.</p><p>'Which is effectively where we are now' in the real world too, the writer warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52866258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW1-DFK1-F021-606F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1164\"/><timeReceived>3:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Discussion of markets and holdings'The market's bifurcation between winners and losers in a COVID/post-COVID environment has lifted advantaged companies to records, while beleaguered businesses with bleak prospects for recovery have seen equity values atrophy.' Jennison Associates LLC Market in Review Equities markets rebounded in the second quarter, but the COVID-19 pandemic's economic damage continued to accumulate. </p><p>U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) provided a preliminary gauge of the toll, contracting by 5.0%. The spread of the virus led to stay-at-home orders, bringing economic activity dependent on face-to-face interaction to a virtual standstill and leading to employment losses not seen since the Great Depression. Authorities acted to contain the economic distress. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) provided liquidity across asset classes and credit intermediaries, alleviating solvency issues and ensuring access to capital. Congress passed the largest fiscal stimulus legislation in U.S. history, providing direct payments to individual households, as well as funds to enable small businesses and service industries to maintain their payrolls, hire back laid-off employees, and cover overhead. Awash in liquidity, markets began rebounding dramatically in late March, just as health-care-system utilization and fatality rates across the hardest hit regions of the pandemic's first wave reached their peaks. Although economically debilitating, social distancing and work-from-home initiatives helped to flatten inflection curves and relieve health-care systems pushed to the brink of collapse. Corporations able to do so capitalized on easing financial conditions, issuing record amounts of public debt at low nominal interest rates. Less well-positioned businesses were left to access loans from the government on less favorable terms. Energy prices rebounded, as major producers agreed to cut production. The patchwork of regional responses to the virus underscored the absence of a coherent national strategy to combat the pandemic and reflected increasing politicization of the crisis. As conditions improved in the Northeast and Midwest, many states in the South and West, which had had few restrictions on crowding and no social-distancing or mask-wearing recommendations, experienced alarming rates of infection as the quarter drew to a close. The late June surge in cases in these regions prompted some authorities to rescind moves to reopen. Portfolio Performance In the second quarter of 2020, the Harbor Capital Appreciation Fund (Institutional Class) returned 34.29%, outperforming its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which returned 27.84%. For the year-to-date through June 30th, the growth benchmark rose 9.81% and the S&amp;#38;P 500 fell -3.08%. During the quarter, every sector in both indexes advanced. In the growth benchmark, only three sectors\u2014Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Energy (with a near-negligible weighting)\u2014outperformed the overall index. Fund holdings in virtually every sector contributed positively to absolute and relative return in the quarter, with stock selection and sector weights both broadly beneficial to the Fund's performance. As in the first quarter, positions in the Fund's largest areas\u2014Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary\u2014were especially strong performers. The impressive performance of many Fund holdings in the quarter reflected indications that the digital transformation of the global economy is accelerating meaningfully. Social-distancing and shelter-in-place directives, necessitated by the pandemic, have underscored the value, utility, and resilience of e-commerce, digitally enabled payment, cloud computing, and streaming business models. Contributors and Detractors Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN[1]) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA[2]) were among the Fund's top contributors during the second quarter. Amazon continues to benefit from economies of scale and its platform-based business model. Through reinvestment in its business, it continues to strengthen its competitive edge. The AWS web services business is an additional driver of revenue and profit. The company's secular growth profile looks even stronger in the current environment. Amazon's first-quarter revenue, reported in April, exceeded consensus forecasts. Tesla has surged on a host of impressive financial metrics made possible by solid production, increased capacity, and strong execution. The stock's strong advance reflected indications that, despite the shutdown of its primary factory for half of the second quarter, production rates may have actually accelerated quarter over quarter. Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR[3]) was the only security held in the Fund to decline in the quarter. Its 'asset-light' model of managing properties, rather than owning capital assets, enhances return-on-invested capital (ROIC) and free cash flow. We trimmed, then eliminated the position on recent lackluster revenue per available room and exposure to the coronavirus's impact on global travel and tourism. Buys and Sells We added Spotify (NYSE:SPOT[4]) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD[5]) to the Fund in the second quarter. Spotify is the world's largest pure-play, music-streaming service. It is both driving and benefiting from the ongoing consumer shift from buying music files to accessing music through audio streaming. We believe Spotify's aggressive move into podcasts and launch of a marketplace business have propelled the stock and company to an inflection point and fundamentally changed the competitive dynamics of the industry. The perceived threat from big tech players and the relative power of the music labels have been reduced, as Spotify has used its scale to improve its business model and strengthen its pricing power. CrowdStrike provides a consolidated, endpoint security platform that protects customers from cyberattacks. It has entered a variety of related markets, including endpoint protection, endpoint search, threat intelligence, endpoint management, cloud workload security, and mobile security. We like the company's rapid growth, large and expanding market, competitive differentiation, significant market share gains, vulnerable competition, and major customer and partner relationships. We sold positions in Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX[6]) and FleetCor (NYSE:FLT[7]) during the quarter. Boston Scientific makes medical supplies and devices used to diagnose and treat various medical conditions. We eliminated the position in May on concerns that elective device procedures could be postponed or cancelled because of the COVID-19 outbreak. FleetCor provides specific-purpose charge cards (used to purchase fuel and lodging) and payment-processing services for commercial and government trucking fleets. It also has a rapidly growing mobile payments business in Brazil. The stock's recent weakness reflects the filing of a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission over the company's marketing and fee practices. Although the dispute will likely be settled, we believe the uncertainty of the outcome presents an overhang that could last several months. We began reducing the position to mitigate the attendant risk and, later in the quarter, because of the company's exposure to oil prices. We eliminated the Fund's holding in June. Outlook A new surge in infection rates has led to second thoughts about phased-in reopenings in the U.S., Europe, and most of Asia even though these countries have been more successful in containing the spread of the virus, while conditions in much of Africa and South America remain acute. While strategies for controlling the spread are well-documented, they require will, determination, and a sense of social responsibility. We believe progress in developing a vaccine has been made, but it will be some time before one is approved and widely available. Ramped-up testing and compliance with social-distancing guidelines seem to be prerequisites for broad economic reopening. Given the uncertainty, companies are taking a cautious approach to near term business planning, and many are suspending financial guidance. Investors and policymakers are wrestling with numerous questions: What are the limits to fiscal stimulus and the Fed balance-sheet expansion? How quickly can unemployed workers be reabsorbed into a reopening economy? Who will win the upcoming U.S. elections, and what are the policy implications? With the crisis several months old now, its effects on economic activity and behavior have become clearer. Consumers have altered their approach to daily life as work from home leads to greater e-commerce engagement, increased demand for food and grocery delivery, and rising spending and investment in dwellings. In addition, faster adoption of streaming services has resulted in attendant needs for robust internet infrastructure. The transformation of work is equally notable and starts with the same necessity for robust connectivity. Face-to-face meetings, business travel, and office needs are being re-imagined, giving rise to Zoom (and other virtual meeting applications), cloud-based telephony, and remote working. The second-quarter recovery in equity prices was as swift and dramatic as was their decline in February and March. Perhaps even more remarkable was the number of stocks that closed at record highs as of June 30. The market's bifurcation between winners and losers in a COVID/post-COVID environment has lifted advantaged companies to records, while beleaguered businesses with bleak prospects for recovery have seen equity values atrophy.

This is up from 5 percent back in 1960. Today, companies can expect to pay $10,000[1]on average in health insurance for each employee every year, up five percent each year for the last five years, according to National Business Group on Health, based in Washington DC. With those rising costs, it's no wonder more and more companies are pushing off those costs to employees. </p><p>Today, the percent of companies paying 100 percent of health coverage hasdropped to 9 percent[2] from 34 percent in 2001. It's also no wonder companies from Apple to Amazon are taking matters into their own hands. Apple recently launched AC Wellness[3], its own clinic to care for its employees. Imagine white walls, white floor with a very clean and elegant look and Siri to greet you. The center, which will offer a \"unique concierge-like healthcare experience\" will be based at the Apple Wellness Centers in Santa Clara Valley. Besides primary care physicians and phlebotomists, the clinic is hiring health coaches and behavioral health partners - clearly an indication that \"wellness\" is a big part of the offerings to be found at clinics these days. Amazon announced its own initiative with partners JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway last month, and that should also include on-site clinics for their employees. We're excited to be hosting our \"Future of Clinics\" event right smack in the middle of all this activity! We hope these weekly roundups are useful to you as we get ready for our salon-styled gathering next Thursday, March 15. At the event, you'll hear from my co-hosts Archana Dubey (Global Medical Director, HP Health Centers,HP[4]) and Frances A. Ayalasomayajula (Population Health Technologies and Innovations Lead, Worldwide Healthcare,HP[5]). HP is one of the largest self-insured employers.

Morgan (Investor,Khosla Ventures[9]), Casper de Clercq (Partner,Norwest Venture Partners[10]),Mark Goldstein (Managing Partner,Advisors.fund[11]).And you'll hear from healthcare incumbents with clinics, as well as tech pioneers innovating on either new clinics or products and services to change the way we receive care. Here's who we'll have a conversation with: Patrick Carroll (Chief Medical Officer Healthcare Clinics,Walgreens)[12], Nikki Sims (Director,Sutter Health[13]Walk-in Care), Nico Arcino (Senior Director, Strategic Partnerships,Kaiser Permanente),[14]Munjal Shah (CEO ...-founder,Health IQ[15]), Sean Duffy (Co-Founder ...O,Omada Health[16]), Neil Parikh (Senior Medical Director of Care Delivery,Oscar Health[17]), Andy Kurtzig (CEO,JustAnswer[18]) Check out the event here[19]. A special thanks to our main sponsor HP! And to Avison Young, Scrubbed, Stratpoint and Advsr. In the meantime, enjoy our roundup!Why Apple, Amazon and Google are making big healthcare movesThis piece reviews the latest developments among the big tech companies. For Amazon, the piece reiterates what many are saying, which is that Amazon will use its new partnership to strengthen its position to become an online pharmacy. But it also underscores Amazon's potential to be on the front lines of delivering any health service or product. For Apple's part, it definitely is looking to build an Apple-like experience with its own clinic. If anyone is to create a brick-and-mortar clinic, it should be Apple. And as I said above, Apple is definitely looking to be more focused on wellness. As for Verily, which is part of Alphabet, it appears to be focused on becoming an insurance provider by getting into Medicaid managed services, while Uber wants to replace ambulances. What is an interesting read in this article is whether or not these tech titans can reinvent a very complex and highly-regulated industry. For instance, for Amazon to be an online pharmacist, it will now have to deal with the FDA (regulating drugs), pharmacy benefits managers (brokering deals between drugmakers and insurers), health insurers (who hate rising drug prices) and drug makers (who like rising drug prices).

Where there is a big disparity, though, is in the age groups that are using it. That same survey found that the company heavily skews young, with more than half of its users under the age of 34. Those in the 55 to 64 range make up a paltry 6 percent of its total user base in the U.S. It makes sense when you realize that older people are less likely to own a smartphone, or any kind of mobile device, for that matter, which they would need to be able to use Uber.Though the number that use smartphones isclimbing[22], they still remain an untapped customer base for the company. Now Uber has figured out a pretty clever way of getting those people into Uber cars without even needing them to own a phone: have their doctor's office do it for them. After all, that is the demographic that ismost likely to use take advantage of the healthcare system[23]. Uber recently launchedUber Health[24], which shuttles patients to and from the doctor's office. The patient doesn't need to do anything to book the appointment or confirm the ride, as everything is done for them. What will healthcare look like with smart speakers?Voice-powered technologies such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana, are changing the way people shop, drive cars, and manage their homes. Studies have suggested that, by 2020,50% of all searches[25]will be conducted by voice and smart speakers are expected to reach55% of U.S. households[26]by 2022. It is no different for physicians. In a nationwide survey of pediatricians conducted by Boston Children's Hospital (not yet published), 62% of respondents said they have used voice-assistant technology, and one-third own, and use, at least one 'smart speaker.'

You can call him a caregiver or companion or friend - or all of the above. In the end, he's doing what most AI folks are working on today: crunching massive volumes of data to understand the human condition. When will this happen? Probably in 10 years. Already we're asking questions to Dr. Alexa and Dr. Siri. And already 20 percent, or one in five, of consumers say they've used healthcare services powered by AI, whether they're robots, virtual clinicians, home-based diagnostic tools, according to a 3000-person survey by Accenture.

Only six countries \u2014 Italy, Sweden, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg \u2014 voted against the proposed directive that will change the Internet as we know it.This means that EU member countries have two years to comply by drafting their own national laws. This is sure to spur protests and legal battles all over Europe for the next few years. </p><p>The directive was passed despite more than 5.2 million people who signed an online petition[4] calling to save the Internet and abandon the legalese. Throughout the voting process, there were numerous tricks by EPP Group and other political parties involved in the copyright directive, or ACTA 2, such as attempting to change the voting date[5], intimidating politicians by threatening[6] them with bad press, and even changing the article numbers prior to the vote.[7]In the plenary debate, MEP Kone\u010dn speaks of threats having been issued by press publishers against MEPs who plan to vote against the #copyright[8] deal. #Article11[9] #SaveYourInternet[10] \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) March 26, 2019[11] If that wasn't enough, a report by a German publication has revealed that the real reason Germany caved to France in February is because the country was bribed in negotiations to get approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia[12]. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has previously warned that the proposed policies within ACTA 2 will increase censorship and surveillance throughout Europe and create a Stasi state. The digital rights organization specifically calls on people from Germany, Sweden, Poland, and Luxembourg, to speak out.[13] 'Your national government depends on your goodwill to win the votes to continue its mandate. This is a rare moment in European lawmaking when local connections from citizens matter more than well-funded, international corporations,' EFF writes. EFFnotes[14]that the petition was created because the law willinevitably lead to the creation of algorithmic copyright filters[15] that only US Big Tech companies can afford (making the field less competitive and thus harder for working artists to negotiate better deals in), and because these filters will censor enormous quantities of legitimate material. AsActivist Posthas continuouslyreported[16],Article 13 is designed to make website owners responsible for the content that users post on their websites, effectively forcing website owners to move behind an upload filter to protect themselves against huge claims by copyright owners and agencies that work on their behalfs like the MPAA and RIAA. Article 11 is aneven worse concept. That has been dubbed the 'link tax' article; if passed, linking to any copyrighted material is taxed upon. Pirate Party Germany member Julia Reda notes the final horrifying shocking changes made to the bill in ablog post[17].Commercial sites and apps where users can post material must make 'best efforts' to preemptivelybuy licences for anything that users may possibly upload- that is: all copyrighted content in the world. An impossible feat. In addition, all but very few sites (those both tiny and very new) will need to do everything in their power to prevent anything from ever going online that may be an unauthorised copy of a work that a rightsholder has registered with the platform. They will have no choice but to deployupload filters, which are by their nature both expensive anderror-prone[18]. Should a court ever find their licensing or filtering efforts not fierce enough, sites aredirectly liable for infringementsas if they had committed them themselves. This massive threat will lead platforms to over-comply with these rules to stay on the safe side, further worsening the impact on our freedom of speech.Reda also expresses that for the link tax, there will beextra copyright for news sites[19], like the one you are reading now.Reproducing more than 'single words or very short extracts' of news stories will require a licence.That will likely cover many of the snippets commonly shown alongside links today in order to give you an idea of what they lead to. We will have to wait and see how courts interpret what 'very short' means in practice - until then, hyperlinking (with snippets) will be mired in legal uncertainty. No exceptions are made even for services run by individuals, small companies or non-profits, which probably includes any monetized blogs or websites. UK Porn BanMeanwhile, in the UK the government has just announced that its proposed 'porn ban' will go into effect on July 15th of this year. All Internet users in the UK will be forced to prove they are over 18 or be entirely blocked from seeing adult content on the Web, The Independent reported[20]. Under the new rules, any provider of online pornography will be forced to implement 'robust age-verification checks on users' to ensure their customers are adults. These checks could include having Internet users enter personal details into a privately owned database or purchase a pass to view content. There will be a number of different ways to prove your age, the government said, all of which will be 'rigorous' and will be much more then just typing details into a checkbox. If pornographic websites fail to comply with the rules, they could have payment services withdrawn or be blocked for all UK users.UK Insane Terrorism LawIf all that wasn't enough, the UK has also passed[21] one of the most draconian pieces of legislation on viewing terrorist propaganda in the history of the Internet.Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace! Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomThe new law has been deemed a 'thought crime' by United Nations inspector Professor Joe Cannataci who has said[22] it seemed 'arbitrary' and added: 'It seems to be pushing a bit too much towards thought crimethe difference between forming the intention to do something and then actually carrying out the act is still fundamental to criminal law.' A number of new rules mean people can be jailed for viewing terrorist propaganda online, entering 'designated areas' abroad, and making 'reckless expressions' of support for certain groups. The designated areas have not been defined by the government yet; however, they are expected to include territory controlled by terrorist groups and war zones throughout the Middle East. Although, the law has an exception for individuals who were forced involuntarily to remain in one of those areas. After NGOs raised human rights concerns, further exemptions include humanitarian work, journalism, and funerals. The government also lengthened prison sentences for several terror offenses, ended automatic early release for those convicted of terrorist actions and put them under a stricter monitoring process after they are freed from prison. UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid said[23] the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 gives 'police the powers they need to disrupt terrorist plots earlier and ensure that those who seek to do us harm face just punishment.' 'As we saw in the deadly attacks in London and Manchester in 2017, the threat from terrorism continues to evolve and so must our response, which is why these vital new measures have been introduced,' Javid added. A detailed report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights also stated that the offense being punishable by up to 15 years in prison, 'is a breach of the right to receive information and risks criminalizing legitimate research and curiosity.' The obvious question one is left wondering is who decides what is 'terrorist propaganda'? Is it only defined as ISIS/al-Qaeda, or is the definition much broader to possibly include protesters against the government in the future? We will have to of course wait and see.UK Creation of First Internet RegulatorThis all comes on the heels of the UK wanting to establish the world's first independent regulator to keep social media companies in check, as CNET reported.[24] This agency will be designed to make the Internet a safer place. The new regulation firm was jointly announced by the Home Office and Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The government white paper, titled Online Harms[25], published Monday in the UK, outlines 'plans for a world-leading package of online safety measures.' 'The White Paper proposes establishing in law a new duty of care towards users, which will be overseen by an independent regulator. Companies will be held to account for tackling a comprehensive set of online harms, ranging from illegal activity and content to behaviors which are harmful but not necessarily illegal,' the release reads. All social media companies, file-hosting sites, online forums, messaging services, and search engines will be required to tackle the following issues:Incitement of violence and the spread of violent (including terrorist) content Encouragement of self-harm or suicide The spread of disinformation and fake news Cyberbullying Children's access to inappropriate material Child exploitation and abuse contentWhile putting an age-restriction filter behind online porn may seem like the right thing to do, introducing an upload filter, introducing an Internet regulator agency and punishing the right to receive information risks punishing legitimate uses of the free Internet. Because of these new measures combined with systems already in place, we are only one step away from the greater tyranny of the death of freedom of information. Numerous digital rights groups have stated the harsh regulation regime proposed could lead to free speech and privacy violations. 'This is an unprecedented attack on freedom of speech that will see internet giants monitoring the communications of billions and censoring lawful speech,'Big Brother Watch said in a tweet[26].SplinternetThis is leading to a 'splinternet,' a term made popular last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt who predicted[27] that the Internet would collapse into two parts: one led by the Chinese and the other led by the U.S. Although Schmidt didn't mention the UK, the former EU country seems to be leading the effort along with current European Union member countries. A recent Associated Free Press article entitled: 'Breaking the internet: new regulations imperil global network,[28]' highlights the key problem with individual countries creating their own regulatory laws for a system that was created to enable connectivity amongst nations without borders. The Internet is global, a World Wide Web, so this means that website owners will have to conform to multiple countries' laws; this stifles not only freedom of information, but can also harm small businesses that aren't corporate giants like Google or Facebook. Further, as a result, conflicting Internet legislation by multiple countries will ultimately fragment information across networks and countries. Already, with the passing of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[29] as Gizmodo reported, we have seen this taking form. Now, if you visit dozens of American news websites[30] from an EU-based IP address some of the news sites state the following or something similar, 'Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market. We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism.' Internet regulation fascism is rising and it doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon. The question must be asked: where is Anonymous which aided in helping stop past Orwellian Internet legislation? It seems everyone has been quiet despite this ongoing recent push to take away all of our free Internet Rights and freedoms one country at a time. If Internet rights and freedoms are to be kept, then the people need to come together, rise up and protest their governments like never before and let their voices, keystrokes, and digital sit-ins be heard and felt worldwide. Otherwise, we risk entering into an era that will be known as the 21st-century dark ages where information is forgotten due to policing, censorship through upload filters or accused terrorist propaganda content, and generally lost due to not being able to pay for every external link on a website (link tax.) There is no going back once these systems and infrastructure regulatory agencies are in place. Aaron Kesel writes for Activist Post. Support us at Patreon[31].

We have launched a petition for the new EU commission (after the elections in may) to create a new directive that stops the old copyright directive.#StopACTA2[3] #SaveYourInternet[4] #Article11[5] #Article13[6] Sign it and share!</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/vKlJotmKa6\">https://t.co/vKlJotmKa6</url>[7] \u2014 Anonymous (@YourMarkLubbers) April 21, 2019[8]European elections will take place between May 23rd to May 26th, at which point new politicians will take over for the last public servants that betrayed the European people by selling out their Internet for an upload filter and link tax that will change the world as we know it. However, the fresh meat coming into office has a chance to reverse things screwed up by their predecessors and make things right for the European people who have previously opposed the directive in a 5.2 million person petition that was delivered[9] to European Parliament calling for an end to the ACTA 2 proposals in the various Articles for 'reforming digital copyright law.' Activists met on the streets across Europe on several occasions in the past to express their discontent to the EU ACTA 2 bill. On March 23rd, activists first met on the streets to fight against copyright companies and EU bureaucrats seeking to destroy the Internet. The first wave of street protests in at least 20 different cities in 15 countries took place on January 19th, 2019, all across Europe, as Activist Post reported[10]. Despite protests across Europe, MEPs voted on April 15th to successfully redesign the Internet[11] with a censorship directive disguised as a copyright proposal, passed in a vote of 22 countries in favor of the law. Only six countries \u2014 Italy, Sweden, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg \u2014 voted against the proposed directive that will change the Internet as we know it. ACTA 2 required all the dirty tricks[12] in the book to pass the initial vote. Throughout the voting process, there were numerous politricks by EPP Group and other political parties involved in the copyright directive, or ACTA 2, such as attempting to change the voting date[13], intimidating politicians by threatening[14] them with bad press and even changing the article numbers prior to the vote.[15] If that wasn't enough, a report by a German publication has revealed that the real reason Germany caved to France in February is because the country was bribed in negotiations to get approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia[16]. With ACTA 2 passing this means that EU member countries have two years to comply by drafting their own national laws. This is sure to spur protests and legal battles all over Europe for the next few years. Unless activists and hacktivists using Change.org have something to say against it.; The petition[17] states:As you are probably aware, a Copyright Directive was introduced in the European Union that will change our Internet forever. Article 11 and Article 13 (now called Article 15 and Article 17) will introduce an #uploadfilter and a #linktax. This is unacceptable to us. We ask the new European Commission to introduce a new directive repealing the current copyright directive including the widely criticized articles 15 and 17 (known previously as articles 11 and 13). How this is done is up to you, but we do not give our consent to launch ANY law that introduces the Internet censorship and forces the website owners to proactively monitor their services. To anyone who considers signing: between 23 and 26 May 2019 there will be new elections in the EU. This petition is to be delivered to the new EU Commission. Let's give them a clear message that we want them to create a new directive that will invalidate the current Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market that was adopted by the European Parliament on 26 March and approved by the Council of the European Union on 15 April 2019.

The choice, of course, is yours; the decision to oppose you is ours! Currently, the new petition[20] to be delivered to the European Commission on May 26th has a total of 1,007 people who have signed at the time of this report. We urgently ask you to do everything in your power to support the StopACTA2 movement that is coordinated by the Polish StopACTA2 crew and the crew of Anonymous Worldwide and many others including Pirate Parties International with its co-chair Bailey Lamon[21] and board member Raymond Johansen[22].Pirates and Copyright activists Pls follow @stopActa2_eu[23] fighting article 11 ... digitally and with boots on the ground. @PPInternational[24], will coordinate between these people and the #Pirate[25] efforts.

To spell it out bluntly, they are using the legal system as a medium to split the Internet; this will lead to webmasters having to follow multiple countries' laws and having to pay for an upload filter and link tax or just block countries supporting such systems. A recent Associated Free Press article entitled: 'Breaking the internet: new regulations imperil global network,[31]' highlights the key problem with individual countries creating their own regulatory laws for a system that was created to enable connectivity amongst nations without borders. The Internet is global, a World Wide Web, so this means that website owners will have to conform to multiple countries' laws; this stifles not only freedom of information, but can also harm small businesses that aren't corporate giants like Google or Facebook. Further, as a result, conflicting Internet legislation by multiple countries will ultimately fragment information across networks and countries. Already, with the passing of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[32] as Gizmodo reported, we have seen this taking form. Now, if you visit dozens of American news websites[33] from an EU-based IP address some of the news sites state the following or something similar, 'Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market. We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism.' The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has previously warned that the proposed policies within ACTA 2 will increase censorship and surveillance throughout Europe and create a Stasi state. The digital rights organization specifically calls on people from Germany, Sweden, Poland, and Luxembourg, to speak out.[34] 'Your national government depends on your goodwill to win the votes to continue its mandate. This is a rare moment in European lawmaking when local connections from citizens matter more than well-funded, international corporations,' EFF writes. EFF notes[35] that the original petition by activists delivered to Parliament was created because the law will inevitably lead to the creation of algorithmic copyright filters[36] that only US Big Tech companies can afford (making the field less competitive and thus harder for working artists to negotiate better deals in), and because these filters will censor enormous quantities of legitimate material. As Activist Post has continuously reported[37], Article 13 is designed to make website owners responsible for the content that users post on their websites, effectively forcing website owners to move behind an upload filter to protect themselves against huge claims by copyright owners and agencies that work on their behalfs like the MPAA and RIAA. Article 11 is an even worse concept. That has been dubbed the 'link tax' article; if passed, linking to any copyrighted material is taxed upon. Pirate Party Germany member Julia Reda notes the final horrifying shocking changes made to the bill in a blog post[38].Commercial sites and apps where users can post material must make 'best efforts' to preemptively buy licenses for anything that users may possibly upload - that is: all copyrighted content in the world. An impossible feat. In addition, all but very few sites (those both tiny and very new) will need to do everything in their power to prevent anything from ever going online that may be an unauthorised copy of a work that a rightsholder has registered with the platform. They will have no choice but to deploy upload filters, which are by their nature both expensive and error-prone[39]. Should a court ever find their licensing or filtering efforts not fierce enough, sites are directly liable for infringements as if they had committed them themselves. This massive threat will lead platforms to over-comply with these rules to stay on the safe side, further worsening the impact on our freedom of speech.Reda also expresses that for the link tax, there will be extra copyright for news sites[40], like the one you are reading now.Reproducing more than 'single words or very short extracts' of news stories will require a license. That will likely cover many of the snippets commonly shown alongside links today in order to give you an idea of what they lead to. We will have to wait and see how courts interpret what 'very short' means in practice - until then, hyperlinking (with snippets) will be mired in legal uncertainty. No exceptions are made even for services run by individuals, small companies or non-profits, which probably includes any monetized blogs or websites.The EFF stated[41] last month this battle isn't over, laws can still be challenged in court, EU citizens will need to organize and support independent European digital rights groups[42]. In a blog post[43], Danny O'Brien\u2014international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)\u2014called the passage of the copyright law 'a stunning rejection of the will of five million online petitioners, and over 100,000 protestors this weekend.' If you think that the EU's internet legislation doesn't affect you then you are wrong and don't understand how the Internet works. Besides the EFF, 54 NGOs and 40 academics have issued separate open letters to the EU Council stating these 'texts risk creating severe impediments' or the Internet and its users. The NGOs declared[44] that the implementation of article 11 is both unnecessary, as well as a risk to a majority of media and hinders the ability of users to share information. Similarly, they note that article 13's requirement for 'error-prone, intrusive and legally questionable' upload filters represent a threat to fundamental rights, leading to the blocking of legitimate content. Academics have expressed[45] much of the same concerns when rumors began that the EU was discussing the potential copywrong policies in 2016. In addition, 70 Internet and computing luminaries have previously spoken out[46] against the dangerous provisions. The group, included \u2014 Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, the inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, co-founder of the Mozilla Project Mitchell Baker, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, cryptography expert Bruce Schneier, and net neutrality expert Tim Wu. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized the vote, tweeting in German, 'Never forget what they did here.'Vergiss nie, was sie hier gemacht haben. Da die @CDU_CSU_EP[47] gestimmt hat f\u00fcr nie mehr Internetfreiheit, muss das Internet f\u00fcr nie mehr @CDU_CSU_EP[48] stimmen. #nieMehrCDU[49]       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/fyGLXfGw3n\">https://t.co/fyGLXfGw3n</url>[50] \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 26, 2019[51] Internet regulation fascism is rising and it doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon. The question must be asked: where is Anonymous which aided in helping stop past Orwellian Internet legislation? It seems everyone has been quiet despite this ongoing recent push to take away all of our free Internet Rights and freedoms one country at a time. If Internet rights and freedoms are to be kept, then the people need to come together, rise up and protest their governments like never before and let their voices, keystrokes, and digital sit-ins be heard and felt worldwide. Otherwise, we risk entering into an era that will be known as the 21st century dark ages where information is forgotten due to policing, censorship through upload filters or accused terrorist propaganda content, and generally lost due to not being able to pay for every external link on a website (link tax.) There is no going back once these systems and infrastructure regulatory agencies are in place. On social media, supporters are using the following hashtags for digital protests \u2014 #stopACTA2, #CopyrightDirective, #SaveYourInternet, #SaveTheInternet, #SaveOurInternet #Article11, #Article13, #UploadFilters, #LinkTax, #Filternet, #ACTA2 #Anonymous.

Good luck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No snark. I wish him well. Competition is good for everybody. Elevating the economy of Washington's second-largest city would be good for the state, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than boosterism is involved in Spokane's effort. More even than the normal focus of local politicians on jobs (some pols here in Seattle seem to regard them, especially the well-paid ones coveted by places such as Spokane, as a curse).</p><p>Spokane needs to up its game if it wants to catch some of the better-performing metros its size. The metro area's performance during this long expansion has been mixed at best, boosterism notwithstanding.</p><p>This old railroad-and-natural-resources capital is emblematic of the challenges facing numerous American inland metros. Yes, it's cheaper to buy a house, but most wages are lower, too. The migration from the coasts that urban scholars often advocate isn't happening in a way that helps many \"left behind\" places.</p><p>Spokane's labor force is at a record high, yes. Manufacturing employment has crept up from its Great Recession low, too. But it remains well below not only its levels of the 1990s but also the 2000s.</p><p>Overall job creation is a challenge.</p><p>In March, the most recent month with seasonally adjusted data, metro Spokane's unemployment rate was 5.5%. That compares with 3.9% for Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue. Spokane's rate typically runs higher than Seattle. Nationally, the rate was 3.8%.</p><p>Higher joblessness is not necessarily a problem of all midsized cities beyond the coasts. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, both with similar population to Spokane, clocked in at 3.3%. Elsewhere in the Intermountain West, Boise, Idaho's unemployment rate in March was 2.7%. Salt Lake City was 2.9%.</p><p>The poverty rate is high in Spokane, too, 19.4%, compared with the national average of 12.3%.</p><p>The Milken Institute's latest Best Performing Cities report ranked Spokane 103 overall, out of 200 U.S. metropolitan areas. (Seattle-Bellevue-Everett was No. 8). Provo-Orem, Utah, with a similar population to Spokane, ranked No. 1.</p><p>Spokane's largest employers are typical of underperforming metros - health care, tribal casino, Walmart and government, especially Fairchild Air Force Base.</p><p>Nor would it be easy for Spokane to poach prime pieces of metro Seattle's diverse economic base.</p><p>Only about 3,000 people there work in the information sector, out of a total civilian workforce of 257,000.</p><p>Only 29.5% of adults in Spokane have a bachelor's degree or higher. That's just below the national average of 30%. Nearly 62% of Seattle residents meet this metric of a highly educated locality.</p><p>Spokane County is very red. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump stomped Hillary Clinton by 48.1% to 39.7%.</p><p>Put all this together and it means Spokane would have a very hard time attracting prime technology talent and high-end offices of Big Tech, as well as minting startups. These typically happen in highly educated, tolerant blue regions.</p><p>Spokane is home to Gonzaga University, a well-regarded Roman Catholic institution; Whitworth University, a small Presbyterian liberal-arts college, and satellites of Washington State University and Eastern Washington University. WSU's new Elson Floyd College of Medicine and other health-science programs are located there.</p><p>Still, a 2017 report by the Milken Institute on technology transfer by universities - a key element of growing a tech economy by commercializing research - ranked the University of Washington No. 7. Spokane's institutions of higher education did not place among the 225 institutions examined.</p><p>For all these reasons, Spokane didn't stand a chance of landing Amazon HQ2. It also lacks the 1 million population requirement and major airport, and is car-dependent with minimal transit.</p><p>That didn't stop Spokane leaders from submitting a 2-inch-thick proposal to Amazon, joining 238 other competing localities.</p><p>Spokane has pluck and ambition, if not all the assets necessary to bring in the top layers of technology or other advanced industries, or to capitalize on the enduring \"back to the city\" movement craved by young talent.</p><p>All that said, Spokane has many lovely areas and some great urban bones, many the remnant of its wealthy days. Unlike many left-behind cities, it has a real downtown with architectural variety and a beautiful park - home to the Expo '74 world's fair - as well as luxury apartments in the former Macy's building. Enchanting wilderness is nearby.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about a study that showed Spokane among the top cities in the country with so-called opportunity jobs for people without college degrees. Newcomers from a variety of backgrounds find it a great place to live.</p><p>Seattleites weary of the city's in-your-face liberalism might be happy to know that Spokane outlawed camping on public land.</p><p>Still, I doubt the mayor and other officials can persuade many companies in cities such as Seattle and Denver to move there, beyond relocating lower-end assets. Amazon is opening a \"fulfillment center\" (read large warehouse).</p><p>Spokane might have better luck recruiting assets from non-superstar cities.</p><p>It might learn some lessons from Orem-Provo. In ranking it No. 1 among best-performing metros, Milken cited \"a dynamic high-tech sector, educated workforce, and business-friendly tax and regulatory climate.\"</p><p>But the Utah metro is a close commute to Salt Lake City, a blue island with the University of Utah, and has established itself as a high-tech hub. Provo is connected to Salt Lake by commuter rail.</p><p>Essential to this success has been the leadership and cohesion of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Provo is home to the church-owned Brigham Young University. Both the University of Utah and BYU have robust research capabilities.</p><p>So close and yet so far. Spokane's longtime enemy, especially after the railroads cut back and mining declined, is isolation.</p><p>Spokane is 288 miles from booming Seattle, but it might as well be 2,088.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-fcf405fe831e11e991cc6d1406597274</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7W-7YF1-JBKM-D3NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000980</classCode><className>JOB CREATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000303</classCode><className>CIVIL SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097LT</classCode><className>LABOR FORCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001772</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT RATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX001452</classCode><className>RANKINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

And can England hold off Lithuania in their World Cup qualifier? Good evening. The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, has increased pressure on internet companies in the wake of the Westminster attack, warning them not to provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate. It's understood that Khalid Masood, who killed four people on Wednesday, was using the secure WhatsApp messaging service shortly before he began his murderous rampage. Our correspondent Jonny Dymond reports. Has the freedom to say what you want online and keep it private run into our need for security in an age of terror? Khalid Masood was active on the messaging network WhatsApp just before he started WhatsApp messages are encrypted - his murderous rampage. only the sender and the recipient can see them. Masood is said to have been acting alone, but the authorities would dearly like to know what he said and who he said it to before he began. The security services, says the Home Secretary, need access. We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other. It used to be that people would steam open envelopes or just listen in on phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing - legally, through warrantry - but in this situation, we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get like encrypted WhatsApp. into situations The Home Secretary says she'll be talking to the big tech companies this week about loosening the privacy around messaging networks. For law enforcement, change cannot come soon enough. At the heart of this is a stark inconsistency between the ability of the police to lawfully intercept telephone calls but not when those messages are exchanged via a social-media messaging board, for example, and that is an inconsistency in society, it surely is, and we have to find a solution through the appropriate legislation. It's not just encrypted messaging that alarms the Government. There's also deep concern over the threat of online radicalisation - websites that glorify violence to take part in terror. It's not hard to find.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-b61db62ff085412b9d0c6729bf42d03f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6J-FPX1-DY08-34HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

There are two of the most important. The energy price move that we have seen seems to be forcing a lot of consolidation. We have seen recent deals that have come to the forefront, as some of these companies start to protect their future in a period where oil prices may well remain low for some time. </p><p>I think that is going to force a ways of transactions. A lot of mergers and deals off the back of that. What is the other one you have an eye on? Obviously, social media, technology generally continues to attract a lot of attention. There has been a huge amount of money that has been put into social media over the last 10`15 years, in particular. That is now making its way into those companies and those companies are starting to rise out. What are some big tech company investments we should be keeping an eye on? Are there trends? Give us a glimpse of what you are watching. I think a couple of things are happening. The social processes getting bigger, getting into the fabric. I think that will continue to grow. The other interesting thing that we have seen... A level playing field has been created across the world. There is an opportunity for a small farmer in Indonesia to get online and start selling, for example, whatever they are producing globally. That did not exist before, technology has enabled that. We are seeing the rise of the services businesses. Not people just selling services, but online travel and digital gaming. Looking at business, it sounds like there are good opportunities in different areas, but how is business different because of it? There are three key things we are noticing. The first one is around reputational risk. When you look to invest in a country you need to understand system, the fabric of the people you're dealing with. The second is political risk, which manifests itself in lots of different ways. It acquires a different type of approach and analysis. The third area which is really important is legal risk. We are seeing some changes there. In Singapore we will see the first international commercial Court established in Asia. That, together with the new economic operation within Southeast Asia, will be a major milestone in the development of this region. What are some of the ways that you are doing business, that has changed because of all of the trends we have been discussing? I think one big fundamental change has happened, the rise of mobile. It has happened so fast, businesses in the tech world have had to have this mobile first mentality. Apart from that, I feel the regulatory risk has always been there, but it has kind of stabilised now. I feel regulators are more open to understanding new business models and embracing them. You move and invest money, how has it changed? Financial services the other way round, regulation has become critical to our business. It has meant, unfortunately you were talking about levelling, unfortunately it is creating less of a level playing field, because you are getting the start up costs of creating an investment company or a banking business, it is now so much higher than it ever was, regulators are less likely to allow new businesses to start, let alone the start`up cost, which is X times what it used to be. We are going to be in a challenging environment for the financial services industry for the foreseeable future. Yes, it is likely, although we keep saying every year it is going to improve. Likely to improve over the coming years, as a lot of these multi`billion dollar fines start to alleviate, but that is still a major headwind for the financial services industry. Thank you very much indeed. We have heard about the economic end, but what about the world of sport? I caught up with Vincent Tan, the Malaysian billionaire and colourful owner of Cardiff City football club to discuss what next year could hold. One of the businesses we like when we go overseas is real estate,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-1f96ecced1ff4ae68ad4045d6f08a9c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DWD-7YC1-JBH6-C40C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 TVEyes, Inc.

(AP)  It\u2019s early in a college basketball game and Team A, playing methodically and using up most of the 30-second shot clock, falls behind 10-6. Scattered around the bleachers, several fans staring at their smartphones celebrate silently: they have bet on Team B to be the first to reach 10 points and even promised two Team A starters a cut of the winnings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> With dozens of states rushing to capitalize on the U.S. Supreme Court lifting a federal ban on sports gambling, will fixed scenarios like the one above become more common?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The four major pro sports leagues and the NCAA think so, and have argued for years that expanding legal betting will lead to more game-fixing. The pro leagues have sought, unsuccessfully so far, a cut of state gambling revenues to increase monitoring.</p><p> Meanwhile, architects of New Jersey\u2019s successful legal challenge to the sports gambling ban say those fears are overstated and that bringing sports betting out of the shadows will make it easier to detect illegal activity. They point to the Arizona State basketball point-shaving scandal in the 1990s, which was uncovered after legal bookmakers in Las Vegas noticed unusually large sums being wagered on Sun Devils games.</p><p> Yet the prospect of easy, legal access to sports gambling for athletes and others has many in sports concerned.</p><p> \u201cThey\u2019re going to create a bigger pool for more kids and for more money to get involved,\u201d said Jamall Anderson, a running back on the 1996 Boston College football team whose players were found to have bet against their own team. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to create a big mess, I think.\u201d</p><p> TARGETING COLLEGE ATHLETES</p><p> College athletes are generally considered easier to convince than pros to influence games. Two reasons: they are younger and aren\u2019t paid directly to play.</p><p> They also aren\u2019t strangers to wagering.</p><p> A 2016 NCAA survey of more than 22,000 college athletes found nearly one-fourth of male athletes had violated NCAA rules by gambling on sports within the previous year. When the survey was done, sports betting was available only in Nevada or illegally through offshore operators.</p><p> It was another number that surprised the authors: 13 percent of the male athletes who had gambled on sports had wagered on in-game bets, things like whether the next football play will be a run or a pass or of a basketball player will hit the next free throw.</p><p> \u201cWe continue to have concerns that wagering enhancements such as live in-game betting could present increased opportunities to profit from \u2018spot fixing\u2019 a contest as has been uncovered recently in a number of international sports leagues,\u201d the study concluded.</p><p>NCAA rules prohibit athletes, coaches and other athletic department employees from gambling on sports.</p><p> Individual schools make sure athletes know the rules against gambling, sometimes bringing in law enforcement officials or former players to get the message across.</p><p> Will it be enough as laws change?</p><p> Legal sports gambling was the No. 1 topic for every conference meeting this spring, said Bob Vecchione, head of the National Association of College Directors of Athletics.</p><p> \u201cDo you remember back when you were 18 to 20 years of age?\u201d said Vecchione, the Minnesota athletic director. \u201cWhen people told you something, how much did it sink in? That\u2019s what causes some sleepless nights.\u201d</p><p>NCAA officials have said they may consider adjusting rules to account for legal gambling but haven\u2019t specified how.</p><p> INSIDER BETS</p><p> Anderson recounted his experiences in the Boston College football scandal in a 2016 book, \u201cThe Best Bet.\u201d In a recent interview, he described a culture in which gambling was part of the daily routine.</p><p> \u201cYou went to practice and you got your spreadsheet in the locker room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was nothing to sit there on the sidelines and say, \u2018Who you got this week?\u2019 That\u2019s what you do. You\u2019re playing football, watching ESPN, seeing other teams and you\u2019re totally engaged. It was too easy.\u201d</p><p> While no players were alleged to have compromised their performances in games, Anderson  who was injured and did not play during the 1996 season  and other players incurred debts betting on other sports and tried to recoup their losses. Some bet against BC against Syracuse and star quarterback Donovan McNabb. Thirteen players were suspended.</p><p> Rutgers athletic director Patrick Hobbs had a front-row seat to New Jersey\u2019s successful challenge to the 1992 federal sports betting ban. Now, New Jersey sports books are prohibited from taking wagers on college games played in the state or involving schools from the state.</p><p> With inside information being so key to betting markets, any tidbit  say, a student telling friends that his roommate, the star quarterback, just had a fight with his girlfriend  can take on greater significance.</p><p> That highlights the need for more education, Hobbs said.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ll educate on a variety of scenarios and hypotheticals, and say, \u2018Hey look, this may have sounded like an innocent question in the past, but now you have to be careful with that information,\u2019\u201d Hobbs said.</p><p> CURRENT ENFORCEMENT</p><p> Proponents of legal sports gambling often point to Nevada as a model for effective monitoring. Sports betting has been legal in Las Vegas in some form since the 1930s.</p><p> If regulators there are notified of suspicious betting activity, agents from the Nevada Gaming Control Board can open an investigation or work with federal and local authorities if it involves multiple jurisdictions.</p><p> Karl Bennison, the board\u2019s chief of enforcement, said board agents also meet and work with professional leagues, teams, the NCAA, conferences, universities and sports associations, including the International Olympic Committee, to discuss and educate athletes, coaches and others on integrity matters and illegal activity.</p><p> Reports from oddsmakers in Las Vegas have played key roles in the uncovering of illegal sports betting schemes, including the case involving two Arizona State basketball players fixing four games during the 1993-94 season.</p><p> Stevin \u201cHedake\u201d Smith and Isaac Burton Jr. admitted to shaving points  purposely holding the score down with mistakes or missed shots  for $20,000 per game. They were partly trying to erase a reported $10,000 gambling debt to a fellow student who also booked bets.</p><p>Las Vegas bookmakers reported suspicious betting activity when gamblers placed about $900,000 in bets against Arizona State on a meaningless contest against Washington. The heavy betting caused sports books to change Arizona State from a 10 \u00bd-point favorite to a 3-point favorite.</p><p> \u201cYou might write $30,000 or $40,000 total on both sides of that game under normal conditions,\u201d Jimmy Vaccaro, then-sports book director at Mirage Resorts, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe wrote $560,000 on that game. The people thought the fix was in and ended up blowing their money.\u201d</p><p> Scandals like that are rare, but sports book operators say other situations could raise red flags, such as a bettor refusing to show an ID when trying to place a bet, or attempting to place large bets without a prior history with a particular casino.</p><p> Jay Kornegay, sports book director at the Westgate Las Vegas, said that in those instances, the books would look at what happened in that game, including suspicious plays and performances. If the oddsmakers think something is going on, they can refer it to regulators.</p><p> OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</p><p> Legal sports betting has been a part of the landscape abroad for years, and so have gambling-related scandals.</p><p> Authorities have busted soccer match-fixing rings in Greece, Spain and eastern Europe in recent years. FIFA, the sport\u2019s world governing body, recently banned a Ghanaian referee for life for his questionable calls during a World Cup qualifying game in 2016; in April, four South African match officials reported being offered $30,000 to fix an international club game in Nigeria.</p><p> The sport most susceptible to match-fixing or manipulation, however, may be tennis. A report published in April by an independent panel found \u201cbetting-related corruption and other breaches of integrity have taken firm root\u201d in the sport, particularly in the lower and middle levels of the men\u2019s game.</p><p> The report cited the sheer number of matches worldwide  115,000, it estimated  many featuring little-known players and lax monitoring. It also pointed to a decision several years ago by pro tours to sell live scoring data, which created more opportunities for legal sports books to offer in-game wagering.</p><p> In the four months since the report was issued, several men\u2019s players have been suspended, two for life, and authorities in Belgium detained more than a dozen people on suspicion of fixing tennis matches.</p><p> The suspensions grew out of investigations by the Tennis Integrity Unit, formed by the sport\u2019s governing bodies in 2009.</p><p> Joe Asher, chief executive of London-based bookmaker William Hill, said many scandals would stay in the shadows if bets are placed illegally.</p><p> \u201cThe illegal bookie isn\u2019t picking up the phone and calling the FBI, he\u2019s just going to try to get on the same side of the bet,\u201d Asher said. \u201cSo that\u2019s the difference between the black market and the legal market that exists today.\u201d</p><p> Garcia-Cano reported from Las Vegas.</p><p> More AP sports: <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports\">http://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/AP_Sports\">http://twitter.com/AP_Sports</url></p><p> The Conversation</p><p> In 1968, computers got personal: How the \u2018mother of all demos\u2019 changed the world</p><p> Author</p><p> Margaret O\u2019Mara</p><p> Professor of History, University of Washington</p><p> Disclosure statement</p><p> Margaret O\u2019Mara does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</p><p> Partners</p><p>University of Washington provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.</p><p> On a crisp California afternoon in early December 1968, a square-jawed, mild-mannered Stanford researcher named Douglas Engelbart took the stage at San Francisco\u2019s Civic Auditorium and proceeded to blow everyone\u2019s mind about what computers could do. Sitting down at a keyboard, this computer-age Clark Kent calmly showed a rapt audience of computer engineers how the devices they built could be utterly different kinds of machines \u2013 ones that were \u201calive for you all day,\u201d as he put it, immediately responsive to your input, and which didn\u2019t require users to know programming languages in order to operate.</p><p> Engelbart typed simple commands. He edited a grocery list. As he worked, he skipped the computer cursor across the screen using a strange wooden box that fit snugly under his palm. With small wheels underneath and a cord dangling from its rear, Engelbart dubbed it a \u201cmouse.\u201d</p><p> The 90-minute presentation went down in Silicon Valley history as the \u201cmother of all demos,\u201d for it previewed a world of personal and online computing utterly different from 1968\u2019s status quo. It wasn\u2019t just the technology that was revelatory; it was the notion that a computer could be something a non-specialist individual user could control from their own desk.</p><p> Shrinking the massive machines</p><p> In the America of 1968, computers weren\u2019t at all personal. They were refrigerator-sized behemoths that hummed and blinked, calculating everything from consumer habits to missile trajectories, cloistered deep within corporate offices, government agencies and university labs. Their secrets were accessible only via punch card and teletype terminals.</p><p> The Vietnam-era counterculture already had made mainframe computers into ominous symbols of a soul-crushing Establishment. Four years before, the student protesters of Berkeley\u2019s Free Speech Movement had pinned signs to their chests that bore a riff on the prim warning that appeared on every IBM punch card: \u201cI am a UC student. Please don\u2019t bend, fold, spindle or mutilate me.\u201d</p><p> Earlier in 1968, Stanley Kubrick\u2019s trippy \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d mined moviegoers\u2019 anxieties about computers run amok with the tale of a malevolent mainframe that seized control of a spaceship from its human astronauts.</p><p> Voices rang out on Capitol Hill about the uses and abuses of electronic data-gathering, too. Missouri Senator Ed Long regularly delivered floor speeches he called \u201cBig Brother updates.\u201d North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin declared that mainframe power posed a threat to the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. \u201cThe computer,\u201d Ervin warned darkly, \u201cnever forgets.\u201d As the Johnson administration unveiled plans to centralize government data in a single, centralized national database, New Jersey Congressman Cornelius Gallagher declared that it was just another grim step toward scientific thinking taking over modern life, \u201cleaving as an end result a stack of computer cards where once were human beings.\u201d</p><p> The zeitgeist of 1968 helps explain why Engelbart\u2019s demo so quickly became a touchstone and inspiration for a new, enduring definition of technological empowerment. Here was a computer that didn\u2019t override human intelligence or stomp out individuality, but instead could, as Engelbart put it, \u201caugment human intellect.\u201d</p><p> While Engelbart\u2019s vision of how these tools might be used was rather conventionally corporate \u2013 a computer on every office desk and a mouse in every worker\u2019s palm \u2013 his overarching notion of an individualized computer environment hit exactly the right note for the anti-Establishment technologists coming of age in 1968, who wanted to make technology personal and information free.</p><p> Over the next decade, technologists from this new generation would turn what Engelbart called his \u201cwild dream\u201d into a mass-market reality \u2013 and profoundly transform Americans\u2019 relationship to computer technology.</p><p> Government involvement</p><p> In the decade after the demo, the crisis of Watergate and revelations of CIA and FBI snooping further seeded distrust in America\u2019s political leadership and in the ability of large government bureaucracies to be responsible stewards of personal information. Economic uncertainty and an antiwar mood slashed public spending on high-tech research and development \u2013 the same money that once had paid for so many of those mainframe computers and for training engineers to program them.</p><p> Enabled by the miniaturizing technology of the microprocessor, the size and price of computers plummeted, turning them into affordable and soon indispensable tools for work and play. By the 1980s and 1990s, instead of being seen as machines made and controlled by government, computers had become ultimate expressions of free-market capitalism, hailed by business and political leaders alike as examples of what was possible when government got out of the way and let innovation bloom.</p><p> There lies the great irony in this pivotal turn in American high-tech history. For even though \u201cthe mother of all demos\u201d provided inspiration for a personal, entrepreneurial, government-is-dangerous-and-small-is-beautiful computing era, Doug Engelbart\u2019s audacious vision would never have made it to keyboard and mouse without government research funding in the first place.</p><p> Engelbart was keenly aware of this, flashing credits up on the screen at the presentation\u2019s start listing those who funded his research team: the Defense Department\u2019s Advanced Projects Research Agency, later known as DARPA; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the U.S. Air Force. Only the public sector had the deep pockets, the patience and the tolerance for blue-sky ideas without any immediate commercial application.</p><p> Although government funding played a less visible role in the high-tech story after 1968, it continued to function as critical seed capital for next-generation ideas. Marc Andreessen and his fellow graduate students developed their groundbreaking web browser in a government-funded university laboratory. DARPA and NASA money helped fund the graduate research project that Sergey Brin and Larry Page would later commercialize as Google. Driverless car technology got a jump-start after a government-sponsored competition; so has nanotechnology, green tech and more. Government hasn\u2019t gotten out of Silicon Valley\u2019s way; it remained there all along, quietly funding the next generation of boundary-pushing technology.</p><p> Today, public debate rages once again on Capitol Hill about computer-aided invasions of privacy. Hollywood spins apocalyptic tales of technology run amok. Americans spend days staring into screens, tracked by the smartphones in our pockets, hooked on social media. Technology companies are among the biggest and richest in the world. It\u2019s a long way from Engelbart\u2019s humble grocery list.</p><p> But perhaps the current moment of high-tech angst can once again gain inspiration from the mother of all demos. Later in life, Engelbart described his life\u2019s work as a quest to \u201chelp humanity cope better with complexity and urgency.\u201d His solution was a computer that was remarkably different from the others of that era, one that was humane and personal, that augmented human capability rather than boxing it in. And he was able to bring this vision to life because government agencies funded his work.</p><p> Now it\u2019s time for another mind-blowing demo of the possible future, one that moves beyond the current adversarial moment between big government and Big Tech. It could inspire people to enlist public and private resources and minds in crafting the next audacious vision for our digital future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-121385649</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A92EA5CDD23 NWBKOH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9C-F371-JBCN-405B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 AIM Media Midwest Operating, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The European company also said Apple at times rejected security updates of its app and threatened to kick it out of the App Store for allegedly anti-competitive reasons.</p><p>\"Apps should compete on merits, not who owns the app store,\" said Spotify general counsel -Horacio Gutierrez.</p><p>Spotify's anti-trust filing, the first disclosed about Apple's App Store at the EU level, escalates the global battle over how to regulate tech giants on issues ranging from privacy and taxation to hate speech and competition.</p><p>The European Commission in 2016 ordered Apple to repay $US14.5 billion in tax breaks to Ireland and over the following two years fined Google a total of $US7.7bn for anti-competitive -behaviour.</p><p>The commission also has implemented a privacy law that has spawned many investigations; and it is close to approving copyright rules aimed at making tech giants pay more to music companies and news organisations.</p><p>Central to these battles is a basic question: what responsibilities should be placed on companies that serve millions of businesses and billions of consumers with services that in the eyes of many have become essential?</p><p>Activists and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic say big tech companies are now like utilities, and should be regulated as such. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, went further last week, calling for the break-up of such companies as Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>Under particular scrutiny are companies that operate platforms used by thousands of other businesses. For instance, the EU last year opened a preliminary probe into whether Amazon is unfairly competing against merchants that sell goods via its retail site.</p><p>The EU also is close to approving new rules forcing platform operators to be more transparent and predictable in the terms they offer companies using their -service.</p><p>Mr Gutierrez hit on that point yesterday. \"Once Apple became not only a platform provider, but also a direct competitor, their incentive to disadvantage rival services, like Spotify, became even greater and their restrictions started to become more frequent and extreme,\" he said.</p><p>Britain yesterday weighed in on the issue of tech dominance, as it published a report from a government panel recommending tighter anti-trust oversight.</p><p>Spotify, one of Europe's biggest tech successes, had complained informally to the EU several times about such issues in recent years.</p><p>In late 2017, for instance, the company and other streaming firms sent the EU a letter criticising the way Apple and Google operated their app stores.</p><p>Deezer, which was among the music streaming firms that complained in 2017, yesterday said it supported Spotify in its anti-trust challenge and looked forward to the commission's response.</p><p>Spotify didn't rule out also pursuing the issue in the US.</p><p>Its complaint comes as Apple accelerates efforts to expand its services business, which includes App Store sales, streaming music subscriptions and mobile payments.</p><p>The company is holding an event on March 25 where it is expected to announce additional services for original video programming, as well as magazines and publishing outlets.</p><p>Services have emerged as a bright spot for the company amid sinking iPhone sales.The business's sales have grown by more than 20 per cent annually over the past three years, approaching $US40bn ($56.7bn) in the latest fiscal year, or 15 per cent of Apple's income.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-7b7b80f245fb11e9a46a61f56c71df4bc569e35b44e2a23a2a33397d52c4a507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-FV71-F0JP-W4Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Instead of an initial public offering, it's trying a direct listing, which essentially lets private stakeholders start trading their shares on a public exchange. That avoids underwriting fees and restrictions on stock sales by current owners, and doesn't dilute the holdings of executives and investors.</p><p>Spotify, which has been valued at about US$15 billion, would be the most prominent company by far to attempt a direct listing, a method that until now has been used by small issuers and real estate investment trusts. It would also be a first for the New York Stock Exchange, which has sought permission from the U.S. Securities &amp;; Exchange Commission to change its rules for the occasion.</p><p>Spotify sent confidential documents to the SEC in late December with the aim of listing its shares in the first quarter of this year, said the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Axios reported the filing earlier Wednesday.</p><p>Non-public filings have become more common since July, when the SEC begin letting all companies file early IPO or stock-listing regulatory documents confidentially - a perk previously reserved for smaller businesses.</p><p>The initial privacy is meant to make the listing process more efficient and encourage more companies to go public. Spotify may be able to keep the documents private until at least 15 days before the share offering is effective.</p><p>If the operation is successful, it could pave the way for other big tech companies, such as Airbnb and Uber, if they decide to go public and current investors don't want their stakes diluted.</p><p>The move has its risks.</p><p>Without underwriters, Spotify shares won't debut with a price based on investor feedback, with buyers lined up. An unusual format can also cause unforeseen problems, as Google discovered in its 2004 Dutch-auction IPO.</p><p>MUSIC'S REBOUND</p><p>Investors have few opportunities to invest directly in the music business, which is in the early stages of a recovery from years ravaged by piracy and a steep decline in CD sales. Online radio service Pandora Media Inc. has struggled to grow in recent years, a red flag for potential investors. But unlike Pandora, Spotify has persuaded tens of millions of people to pay a monthly fee.</p><p>Spotify is led by <person><nameText>Daniel Ek, </nameText></person>a Swedish entrepreneur who co-founded the company and has since recruited a U.S.-based leadership team. While the company is the market leader in musicstreaming, it faces growing competition from tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon. com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.</p><p>Spotify hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Allen &amp;; Co. last year to assess its options for a public offering. The company has already raised more than US$1 billion in equity and obtained a US$1-billion convertible loan from investors led by TPG in March, 2016.</p><p>The conversion was tied to a public offering, with the terms growing more favourable to TPG the longer that takes. By choosing a direct listing instead, Spotify will have to reach a new agreement with the private-equity company.</p><p>Spotify took a major step toward the public offering last year by signing long-term licensing deals with all three major record labels, permitting them for the first time to keep some songs restricted only to paying subscribers. The streaming-music provider also settled a class-action suit last year with songwriters seeking royalties, though some parties were unhappy with the deal and have subsequently filed objections. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The European Commission said it has received Spotify's complaint, which it is assessing under its \"standard procedures.\"</p><p>Spotify's beef with Apple centers on a 30 percent tax it and other digital services have to pay whenever they use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system to process user purchases such as upgrading subscriptions.</p><p>The charge makes Spotify's premium membership more expensive than Apple Music, so the company said it refuses to use the system. But if it shuns Apple's payment system, Spotify alleges that Apple blocks app upgrades or stops it from working with Apple services like Siri assistant.</p><p>U.S. tech giants have already come under intense scrutiny from EU authorities for their behavior. Apple was ordered in 2016 to repay $15 billion in taxes to Ireland by EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has also slapped Google with multibillion-dollar antitrust fines.</p><p>Spotify and German rival Deezer were among European tech industry players that issued a joint letter last year calling on EU ministers to get tougher on unfair business practices by U.S. tech giants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-71614a7d40a84b94adef824d0fb47a8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-8091-DYN6-W02K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><timeReceived>1:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Apple's media team in Britain did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The European Commission said it has received Spotify's complaint, which it is assessing under its \"standard procedures.\" Spotify's beef with Apple centers on a 30 percent tax it and other digital services have to pay whenever they use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system to process user purchases such as upgrading subscriptions. The charge makes Spotify's premium membership more expensive than Apple Music, so the company said it refuses to use the system. But if it shuns Apple's payment system, Spotify alleges that Apple blocks app upgrades or stops it from working with Apple services like Siri assistant. U.S. tech giants have already come under intense scrutiny from EU authorities for their behavior. Apple was ordered in 2016 to repay $15 billion in taxes to Ireland by EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has also slapped Google with multibillion-dollar antitrust fines.

The European Commission said it has received Spotify's complaint, which it is assessing under its \"standard procedures.\"</p><p>Spotify's beef with Apple centres on a 30 per cent tax it and other digital services have to pay whenever they use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system to process user purchases such as upgrading subscriptions.</p><p>The charge makes Spotify's premium membership more expensive than Apple Music, so the company said it refuses to use the system. But if it shuns Apple's payment system, Spotify alleges that Apple blocks app upgrades or stops it from working with Apple services like Siri assistant.</p><p>U.S. tech giants have already come under intense scrutiny from EU authorities for their behaviour. Apple was ordered in 2016 to repay $15 billion in taxes to Ireland by EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has also slapped Google with multibillion-dollar antitrust fines.</p><p>Spotify and German rival Deezer were among European tech industry players that issued a joint letter last year calling on EU ministers to get tougher on unfair business practices by U.S. tech giants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-71614a7d40a84b94adef824d0fb47a8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMY-KMS1-JBVR-34WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><timeReceived>09:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
