The two finalists in the Conservative leadership race are being quizzed endlessly about Brexit, tax and spend, public services, and their private lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All these have some importance, of course, but our next Prime Minister needs to also have a vision for public policy in a very different era from the one in which either of the candidates was born.</p><p>The next few decades will be dominated by digital developments - more information, processed and distributed at ever higher speeds, than ever before.</p><p>How can a new Prime Minister harness this to improve the responsiveness of our public services and the competitiveness of our businesses? How will he balance spectacular new capabilities to enhance our lives with the pressing need to preserve security for all of us, both as individuals and as a nation? Britain is on the brink of a new digital era, with technology as a connector and enabler in all aspects of our lives and a driving force for our economy and country.</p><p>As much time and effort needs to be spent in this contest discussing the growth sectors of the coming century - upon which millions of jobs and lives will depend - as we as a nation have spent in recent weeks talking about the steel or automobile sectors, industries that defined the previous two centuries.</p><p>The scale of the change, even over the last several years, is remarkable: 87 per cent of respondents to research by Deloitte in 2018 claim to own a smartphone, with 95 per cent using it every day, while 90 per cent of people had internet access at home last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, 22m people now manage their current account on their phone - and it is predicted that this number will increase to 35m by as near as 2023 - 72 per cent of the UK adult population.</p><p>Specifically, we need our next Prime Minister to take advantage of emerging technologies and appreciate how they can open doors for innovative and creative policy-making within the government, including through empowering workers across the public sector.</p><p>They won't be starting from scratch. A decade ago, I was extolling the virtues of tech and advising Boris Johnson on where the industry, especially startups, could take London.</p><p>To be honest, he was probably not fully convinced. At the time, there was a lot of talk but not much action. Regardless, he trusted me to use his political capital wisely, to work with Number 10, to shape the agenda for big tech firms to come to London and startups to flourish.</p><p>Eight years later, his instincts to trust people paid off: he was able to boast last month about how tech had created half a million new jobs in London.</p><p>More recently, the current government's digital strategy has set out an approach to ensuring that organisations and citizens can participate fully in the digital economy and prepare for an era of \"total transformation\" of services.</p><p>Building on this, the Digital Skills Innovation Fund shows how public sector bodies, employers and training providers can work together to address local or regional digital challenges while supporting people from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds into digital roles.</p><p>However, there is much more that can be done. We need a better understanding of how people interact with digital in their day-to-day lives.</p><p>While there is a tendency for politicians to opine on the bluechip, game-changing innovations such as automation, artificial intelligence and blockchain, for most people these technologies will operate in the background. It is vital that the next government works to facilitate the ever-increasing cluster of devices and data that will help to deliver everyday services, interactions and experiences. This will help those on the frontline of service delivery, particularly in the public sector, to focus on the most important parts of their jobs - be it nurses in the NHS or teachers in our schools.</p><p>This will, of course, require close collaboration between those who design and deliver this innovation and those that regulate and deliver the associated services. Atos' latest report, Digital Vision for Digital Britain, discusses how total transformation across industry and the public sector will not only ensure that organisations have adaptable, future-fit digital operations, but also cultures of shared purpose.</p><p>As we approach the 2020s, the pace of technological change will only continue to increase.</p><p>While the next Prime Minister's first challenge will be to deliver Brexit, he also has the challenge of ensuring that Britain is well equipped to take advantage of the opportunities which digital will offer in the decade ahead.</p><p>\u00a3 Kulveer Ranger is senior vice president (strategy &amp; communications) for Atos.

To judge how it's doing for everyone else, look at life expectancy. These two measures show that America is coming apart at the seams: the stock market is booming while life expectancy has declined for three years running. Those in the top 1%, with incomes above $500,000 a year, are delighted; those in the working class are dying of what researchers have come to call \"deaths of despair.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am for one America, not two. Abraham Lincoln called for a \"government of the people, by the people, for the people,\" -- not a government of the rich, by the lobbyists, for the few. We need policies that produce prosperity for all Americans, including guaranteed health care, decent wages and job benefits, a green new deal and 21st century infrastructure. The 2020 presidential election offers the most important choice our country has faced in generations. American democracy is at stake.</p><p>Donald Trump didn't create the divisions, but he is dramatically and willfully amplifying them. Our widening inequalities of wealth and resources can be traced to an infamous 1971 memo from lawyer Lewis Powell, Jr. to the US Chamber of Commerce. Powell wanted to put corporations into the political driver's seat. That same year Richard Nixon appointed Powell to the Supreme Court, and Powell soon put his plan into operation. In 1978, Powell wrote a disastrous decision (First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti) giving companies free reign to spend corporate money in politics, under the preposterous doctrine that corporate spending on politics is merely free speech under the First Amendment.</p><p>Since then, the lobbies have eaten our democracy alive. The 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which held that corporations and other groups can spend an unrestricted amount of money to promote candidates has massively exacerbated the problem. Since then, campaign funding through Super PACs and dark money groups has soared.</p><p>This contradicts what Americans want for our political system. By a huge margin, 77% to 20%, according to Pew Research Center data from 2018, Americans want limits on money in politics. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court opened the way for the corporate takeover of politics through massive campaign spending. In the future, the Supreme Court's campaign contribution decisions will be as infamous as the Court's reactionary decisions on slavery, separate but equal, and rejection of fair labor standards in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>Since the early 1980s, inequality in the US has soared. Starting with Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, the rates paid by the richest Americans have been slashed. Since then, repeated rounds of tax cuts have further benefited the rich. By 2018, the richest 400 Americans paid lower taxes as a share of income than any other income group including the poorest Americans, according to Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The environmental movement, bipartisan at its start in 1969, was similarly derailed by big money in politics. Corporate lobbies have successfully pressured government officials to gut environmental regulations. America has gone from being the world's environmental leader to being the environmental rogue as Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the only country of the 193 UN member states to leave the accord.</p><p>Six major lobbies have taken the helm of political power. Wall Street has financialized the economy so that corporate CEOs could be paid in stock options, compensating themselves excessively more than their workers, while unions were busted and workers' pay stagnated. Big health care has monopolized local healthcare delivery and drug prices, leading to a healthcare system that costs more per person than any other country in the world. The fossil-fuel industry (coal, oil, and gas) has fought all attempts to limit global warming, up to and including America's withdrawal from the climate agreement. The military-industrial complex has continued to push a worldwide network of hundreds of overseas military bases and perpetual wars backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of military spending per year, much of it for private contractors. Corporate-owned prisons took the prison system private, and then lobbied for policies that result in poor African-Americans being locked up to keep the prisons full.</p><p>And now big tech uses our personal data without proper protections of privacy and monetizes the data through online advertising and manipulations of e-commerce -- all the while getting the President and Congress to protect the sector from fair taxation and regulation.</p><p>The method of the corporate lobby takeover was anything but subtle. Their power is money. Over the years, these industries have contributed billions in campaign funds.</p><p>They have spent billions more on lobbying outlays, some of which have employed former Congressmen and their families, in return for previous loyal support.</p><p>America's political system has been sold to the highest bidder. Consider some of the numbers from the 2018 election cycle. Oil and Gas spent $85 million on Congressional campaigns in 2018, of which 87% went to Republicans, and $126 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Health spent $265 million on campaigns, of which 56% went to Democrats and $568 million on lobbying.</p><p>Trump is cruder than his predecessors in support of the corporate lobbies. He is forcing out or pressuring many government scientists and replacing them with corporate shills in order to gut environmental regulations. In 2017, Trump slashed corporate taxes and \"paid\" for the tax cuts by running up the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the budget deficit will reach $1 trillion in 2020.</p><p>Yes, the stock market is soaring as taxes are cut, but the richest 10% of Americans account for 84% of the American stock ownership, according to a 2017 study, while 57% of the low income Americans report hardships paying their medical bills.</p><p>According to recent survey data from NPR, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, a majority of people in the top 1% report themselves to be \"completely\" or \"very satisfied\" with life. No big surprise. Meanwhile, less than half of poorest Americans reported this same satisfaction. The same survey also shows that less than half of the top 1% believe that the federal government should prioritize narrowing the gap between rich and poor in the future, compared with a majority of low-income Americans. Another recent poll by Reuters and Ipsos shows a strong majority for taxing the wealth of the richest Americans.</p><p>No other high-income democracy has faced the corporate onslaught on national politics as has America. The result: America is falling behind our counterpart nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on almost all major social indicators. America's life expectancy now ranks 28th among the OECD countries.</p><p>America is the only one of the top 25 highest income OECD countries without the guaranteed right to healthcare. It is the only industrialized nation without guaranteed paid leave for new mothers and out of the 21 richest countries in the world, the US is the only one that does not guarantee paid vacation days. It costs more to be a college student in America than any other country worldwide, leaving many with crippling student debts, now totaling around $1.5 trillion for 44.5 million Americans.</p><p>As the other high-income countries amply prove, America's problems can be solved if our democracy can be retaken from the corporate lobbies and the big money in politics.</p><p>Bernie Sanders is running a true grassroots campaign, relying on more than 5 million individual donations so far to beat the big money. His movement harks back to the progressive era a century ago, when a similar grassroots movement successfully took on the power of the industrial robber barons of the late 19th century. Sanders' movement aims to wrest power from the corporate lobbies to reinvigorate our democracy -- and that is exactly what the country needs.</p><p>Politics this election year is therefore about the two Americas, the small group at the very top versus the common good. Trump brazenly stands on the side of the richest Americans. A true grassroots movement can restore fairness and prosperity for working Americans.

'You are not committing,' she told Warren, before she did just that.</p><p>Warren told the crowd as the protesters excited the ballroom she was addressing that she wants to expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship not just for Dreamers but families, too. </p><p>'A path for citizenship that is fair and attainable,' she said of her plan. </p><p>She said illegal immigrants who have been in American for years and and 'integrated' into their communities should be be allowed to remain in the country. </p><p>'Part three is I will stop this ugly mess at our borders,' she said. 'No great nation tears families apart. No great nation locks up children. We need at the - we must at the borders respect the dignity of every human being who comes here.'</p><p>The Massachusetts senator became emotional as she discussed her visit to the McAllen, Texas, intake facility for immigrants who cross the border illegally.</p><p>'I saw firsthand the cages. The cages of women. The cages of men. And then the cages of little girls,' she said. 'And they're, they're just clumped together in cages.' </p><p>Warren said she'd crack down on sexual and physical abuse at the detention centers. She said on her first day in office she'd appoint a commission to look into those crimes.</p><p>'And Donald Trump may be willing to look the other way, but President Elizabeth Warren will not,' she said to loud applause. </p><p>Warren had taken the stage at the gathering she's been attending for years to rapturous applause. An attendee in the packed hall, where the fire marshal had already issued a warning about stuffing the aisles, shouted to her, 'We love you, Liz!' </p><p>The audience chanted the Massachusetts senator's name. 'Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren,' they declared.</p><p>She reminisced about the early days, when she set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for Barack Obama with the backing of conference's community and charged ahead with a recommendation to heavily regulate top tech brands.</p><p>'Oh boo hoo,' she said of a $5 million fine the Federal Trade Commission hit Facebook with Friday for privacy violations.</p><p>The company's stock went up, not down, after the announcement. </p><p>'We need to break up big tech,' she proclaimed.</p><p>Warren said companies like Amazon are making a fortune off small businesses and user data.</p><p>'They provide the platform. Yay! I love the platform. But they also suck up information about every one of those transactions,' she said. 'They suck up enough information to figure out, \"Oh, this pet cookie store is profitable.\" And so what do they do? They use that information to design what will be the Amazon pet cookies store.'</p><p>She said they call the product by another name, 'And then they move your profitable business that you sweated and bled for back to page seven, where it dies.'</p><p>Warren said that companies should have to choose whether they want to provide the platform for product sales or create products, 'But you don't get to do both.'</p><p>Additionally, she said the U.S. needs to enforce existing anti-trust laws so that large companies do not have as much power to steamroll small businesses.</p><p>'Over time, creating these bigger and bigger giants, are both enormously damaging to the marketplace, to consumers and ultimately to democracy,' she said. 'When giant companies have so much power that they get to call the shots in Washington, it's no longer just about the economy that they own, it's our entire country. We've got to fight back on this.' </p><p>Warren said the criminal justice system needs to be reformed, front to back, so that minorities receive equal justice under the law.</p><p>She said she strongly supports marijuana legalization. 'It's not just for the few of you who think it's funny,' she said after some attendees whooped and hollered. 'Not just for the mellow folks in the back. Or the folks with all the cookies over there.'</p><p>Rather, she said blacks and whites use marijuana at the same rate, yet blacks are three times more likely to go to jail for abusing the substance.</p><p>'So easy answer for me. Make it legal, and then that problem goes away,' she added. </p><p>Cash bail also needs to be eliminated and cannot be replaced with a system that discriminates against certain communities. For-profit prisons should also be banned, she said.</p><p>'We've got to reform this whole system,' she asserted. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-54460549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJV-1PC1-F021-604J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1165\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 26085 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0052: Unparseable date: \"0052\"GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Here is a collection of smart solutions.           </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      See more solutions             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the federal and state governments assess their response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, they desperately need independent, credible scientific review and advice. To do so, they should turn to the National Academy of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the Republican-controlled Senate is planning to conduct oversight hearings, and the White House coronavirus task force might conduct an internal evaluation, these reviews will be insufficient. Much of the American public no longer trusts the administration or a partisan Congress to level with them on this issue. It has also become clear that experts in federal agencies are often not free to speak the truth, and congressional committees cannot possibly unravel the scientific complexity of this pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We need the best our scientific community can offer, and for that, Congress must commission a panel of experts to assess the federal and state covid-19 response to date, how to best prepare for a potential second wave this winter and how to prevent the outbreak of another virulent pathogen. This panel should then issue an interim report by Sept. 15.</p><p>The National Academies are the only institution that can provide advice on this issue in a scientifically credible, apolitical manner, unfiltered through the hyper-partisan lens of Congress or the administration. The National Academy of Medicine - one of three scientific institutions that were chartered by Congress to provide objective advice nationally and globally on science, technology and health - has more than 2,000 members selected by their medical peers for their outstanding achievement, many in infectious disease prevention and response.</p><p>So far, Congress has been unresponsive to this ask, perhaps out of fear of vindictive pushback from President Trump. But if Congress can set aside politics at this critical moment and consider what's best for the nation, it would immediately agree to convene this expert advisory panel.</p><p>             Rick Steiner is a retired professor from the University of Alaska and author of \"Oasis Earth: Planet in Peril.\"          </p><p>If society truly wants to fight the covid-19 pandemic, we must drastically change one standard modus operandi of the health industry: We must make non-identifiable patient data freely accessible.</p><p>The recent retractions of two high-profile scholarly papers on potential covid-19 treatment drugs - in the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine - make this clear. Both papers were retracted due to problems accessing the raw study data. Authors on the retracted NEJM article state that they did not have access to the data, which came from a company that had refused to allow others to see it.</p><p>It might sound unusual for authors of a scientific paper to never actually see data in their research, but it is not. This sort of secrecy is standard for studies using data from medical centers and insurance companies. Some blame it on privacy concerns even in cases where the data are just a simple table of numbers that can pass all checks of preserving privacy. Others blame it on cost or bureaucracy. The painful truth is that the vast majority of health-care research simply cannot be checked for accuracy.</p><p>What would it take for the medical establishment to change? Months ago, there should have been at least one freely accessible data set on covid-19 patients to help predict death based on age and basic health issues such as diabetes and heart disease. Yet no hospital, insurer or national health service has (yet) released decent-quality individual patient data. And, yes, they all have that data.</p><p>This goes beyond just the pandemic. If society wants to fight disease, racism and other forms of bias in access to high-quality medical care, understand the effects of drugs, and perform reproducible health data science, we need freely accessible data.</p><p>No more excuses. No more blaming the problem on anyone else. Just work together and do it. This is too important, and too many lives are at stake.</p><p>             Cynthia Rudin is a professor of computer science, electrical and computer engineering, and statistical science at Duke University.          </p><p>Countries around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus by running record budget deficits and issuing large amounts of debt to address pressing health needs, support the jobless and aid companies affected by lockdowns. As a result, many countries might soon face a debt crisis on top of their health and economic crises - especially if growth recovers slowly.</p><p>What can be done? History has taught us that delaying debt restructuring and hoping for the best often lead to the worst. When investors begin to worry about debt sustainability, they charge more. Countries are then forced to cut back on productive spending and find ways to reduce interest costs - such as shifting to shorter-term or foreign-currency-linked debt. This only moves the day of reckoning earlier.</p><p>A better way to put a country's debt on a sustainable path is to contractually link future debt payments to different growth outcomes using growth-indexed debt. Here is how it works: If a country recovers faster than expected, it pays more. This makes the terms attractive to creditors, who receive more than their baseline scenarios. In contrast, if a country recovers more slowly, it pays less. This frees up resources for struggling economies to support pressing needs.</p><p>Research shows that the benefits from such an approach are even bigger when the economic outlook is uncertain and debt burdens are high (albeit not so high that debt is unsustainable in most situations) - making it a good solution for our current situation.</p><p>The details in these types of contracts matter. Careful attention must be paid to verifying growth rates, handling data revisions and structuring payment thresholds. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank could help draft contracts that address these technical issues, building on existing work already done in international working groups. Properly constructed growth-indexed debt might be part of the solution to help countries today - as well as avoid a credit crisis later on.</p><p>             Kristin Forbes is a professor of global economics and management at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She served as a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and an external member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee.          </p><p>In an economic downturn, the social safety net broadens to help families who face hardship. But low-income college students are often left out.</p><p>Because some college students have access to family resources that may not appear on an application, most social safety net programs have additional regulations for them to qualify. For example, college students are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better know as food stamps, if they meet certain criteria, such as working at least 20 hours a week or earning Federal Work-Study. Eligibility for unemployment benefits and Medicaid vary by state, but they too often have extra hurdles for students.</p><p>In response to the economic downturn, federal policymakers largely opted not to lift student restrictions and excluded dependent students from stimulus checks. But these decisions have consequences: After the 2008 recession, households with a two-year college student - who are more likely to be from low-income families - saw food insecurity increase substantially.</p><p>My Urban Institute colleagues and I profiled the financial struggles students face during the pandemic. One student, Adam Ramsdell, lost his on-campus job and his SNAP benefits along with it. While legislators chose to help students such as Ramsdell by providing emergency funds for colleges to distribute - and despite the heroic work from institutions and others in the effort to distribute these funds - delays in aid distribution and eligibility roadblocks have meant money is just starting to reach students.</p><p>The crux of the issue is that current policy treats colleges as a safety net, rather than giving low-income students easier access to programs such as SNAP.</p><p>To address this, the federal government could temporarily suspend work requirements for college students previously on SNAP. And if policymakers release a second round of stimulus checks, dependent students should be included. In the long run, policymakers could consider enacting changes to student SNAP eligibility, such as those outlined in the College Student Hunger Act of 2019.</p><p>College students have already experienced substantial upheaval due to the pandemic. Access to social safety net supports could have softened the blow.</p><p>             Kristin Blagg is a senior research associate in the Center on Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute.          </p><p>As we focus on rebuilding our economy while containing the novel coronavirus, it is critical that we rebuild better - investing to create more good jobs, less air pollution and a more stable future.</p><p>The clean energy industry, which had been adding jobs 70 percent faster than the economy as a whole, has lost 600,000 jobs in the past few months. Those workers need and deserve our help. So do workers in the oil-and-gas industry. The collapse in oil prices is doing unprecedented damage to this sector, which was already over-leveraged.</p><p>Oil-and-gas workers should be employed sealing the tens of thousands of designated \"orphan\" wells now on state rolls - old, unplugged wells with no owner of record that can leak air and water pollution for decades, affecting the health of local communities as well as our climate. Canada's recent stimulus bill included 1.7 billion Canadian dollars for plugging orphan wells. The next federal recovery package should do the same, quickly putting oilfield workers back on the job for the small, locally owned contractors who plug and remediate these wells.</p><p>Our investments must also include clean energy, which offers more long-term economic and environmental stability than boom-and-bust oil. Support for solar and wind, electric-vehicle charging infrastructure and upgraded transmission lines are all needed. Because here is the fact: By no later than mid-century, consistent with the demands of science, the United States needs a 100 percent clean economy that produces no more climate pollution than we can remove from the atmosphere.</p><p>Pumping money into the fossil fuel industry as it currently exists will not get us there. Speeding the transition to 100 percent clean energy - including investments in electric trucks and buses and a smarter grid - will. From solar and wind farms to the oil patch, we can put people to work in good jobs that create a better, healthier and more equitable future.</p><p>             Fred Krupp is president of the Environmental Defense Fund.          </p><p>It wasn't long after one of our covid-19 patients was admitted to our hospital that we had to declare his time of death. As with countless other patients around the world, his family could not visit him. But his daughter had been able to FaceTime her father with a donated iPad and sing to him. The patient's body changed as her song filled the room. Toward the end of her song, his breathing slowed. A few moments after the song and the call ended, he left, too. His daughter later said she felt grateful for the opportunity to share those moments with him from across an ocean. Perhaps my patient was waiting for his daughter's permission to leave.</p><p>The donated iPad made this possible, bringing dignity and beauty to his last moments. Such technology should be a cornerstone of health care during this pandemic - and beyond.</p><p>Tablet donation programs have restored connection in time of crisis, allowing hospitals to continue the end-of-life meetings that are critical for families to see the severity of illness and that guide us in providing care based on patients' values. In our hospital, through interdepartmental collaboration among clinicians, social workers, spiritual caregivers and IT personnel, we have been able to make \"virtual visits\" with loved ones a new standard of care for our covid-19 patients. The innovative groundwork laid by staff, coupled with generous donations from community members and charitable foundations, has allowed us to provide every unit in the hospital with iPads to facilitate this digital connection.</p><p>And the tablets are here to stay. Even without a pandemic, some families are unable to visit their loved ones in the hospital. Necessity has shown us that we can bring the technology to the bedside - for now to supplement the standard phone and TV in each hospital room but perhaps even to replace them. This opens up a future in which every hospital bed has a tablet for communication among patients, families and providers. Through a method that no one would have imagined, telecommunication apps such as FaceTime have provided patients dignity in time of death and delivered memories that families will cherish far into the future.</p><p>             Divya Seth and Tyler Trahan are residents in internal medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.          </p><p>The novel coronavirus pandemic has exposed weaknesses and revealed a medical ecosystem that is more fragile and less prepared to deal with medical crises than anyone could have imagined. Among the exposed weaknesses is the loss of a critical component of the biomedical workforce: the physician-scientist.</p><p>Physician-scientists are the all-too-rare doctors whose careers combine patient care and biomedical research. Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a quintessential example. Research by physician-scientists has led to some of the most important medical advances such as penicillin for infection, chemotherapies for cancer and statins for heart disease.</p><p>Unfortunately, the physician-scientist workforce has been on the decline for decades. The most recent data shows that less than 1.5 percent of all U.S. doctors do research. We need a well-trained group of readied physician-scientists who can be deployed at any time to meet our nation's medical needs, whether a coronavirus pandemic or other health emergencies.</p><p>A solution to the decline of physician-scientists is the establishment of a national service program supported by public-private partnerships. Specifically, such a program would provide sustained mentorship and financial support to the best and brightest medical students and residents to develop an intense research-based career. In return, these individuals would dedicate themselves to life-long careers as physician-scientists. Like reservists, they will be available to serve in national crises. They will be mobilized in times of need to tackle unmet medical challenges.</p><p>We are asking leaders in academia, business and government to join us to rebuild the physician-scientist workforce. We cannot leave the nation's health care in disrepair. Let us work together to ensure that we have outstanding medical research and patient care to safeguard the healthy living that everyone deserves.</p><p>             Vivian G. Cheung is an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan's Life Sciences Institute. P.J. Utz is professor and associate dean for medical student research at Stanford University School of Medicine.              Mukesh K. Jain is chief academic officer at University Hospitals and professor at Case Western Reserve University. They are all members of the Physician-Scientist Support Foundation.          </p><p>With the ongoing challenges presented by the covid-19 pandemic, one bastion of hope is that people are generously donating supplies and contributing to relief efforts. People have no problem giving away food and masks, but there is one item that people shy away from donating or even talking about: menstrual products. And right now, they're needed more than ever.</p><p>Consider the homeless woman who could have had access to self-care items including menstrual products through a local homeless shelter. Since many homeless shelters are closed due to the pandemic, she now must live without. Or consider the woman who recently became unemployed. She needs to buy food for her family, but her period just started. In all likelihood, menstrual  products are what get sacrificed.</p><p>These scenarios are not just hypothetical. A 2019 study found that two-thirds of women below the poverty line couldn't afford period products, and almost half of those women had to choose between buying tampons or food. With as much as 20 percent of Americans unemployed, the number of women in this predicament keeps growing.</p><p>If menstrual products are one of the things that women need most right now, why aren't donation bins stacked with them? The simple answer is that periods make people uncomfortable. I know this firsthand; when I lobbied people to sign my petition for free menstrual products in schools last year, I found that many people couldn't even say the word \"tampon,\" much less have an honest conversation about period poverty.</p><p>Just because people don't want to address periods doesn't mean that they will go away; ignoring the problem leads to a greater exigency for a solution. Think about the uproar that would erupt if nobody had access to toilet paper in public bathrooms. People would protest that it's a product necessary for natural bodily functions. Nobody gets squeamish about a pack of Charmin, so why are tampons viewed differently? Regardless of the reason, one thing is clear: Women can't control menstruation, and they shouldn't be punished for that. The stigma surrounding periods needs to end so that women can get access to menstrual products during the pandemic.</p><p>             Emily Aikens is a high school sophomore in Pennsylvania.          </p><p>Disproportionately black counties account for more than half of all covid-19 cases and almost 60 percent of deaths, even though blacks represent 13.4 percent of the American population. Given a clear lack of federal leadership and guidance, it has become apparent that state and local agencies must intentionally move forward to mitigate ongoing racial disparities.</p><p>The problem, however, is that many black Americans distrust the health-care system, due to centuries of neglect, abuse and exploitation of our communities. State and local agencies will need to engage with black communities through a lens of structural humility, by developing an understanding of and responses to the long-lasting effects of structural racism.</p><p>They can do this by strengthening preexisting connections with community-based organizations, such as faith-based organizations and neighborhood coalitions. These organizations already have trusted relationships with community members, which is essential for successful outreach, education and feedback.</p><p>Community health workers could also be a vital solution in this pandemic for black communities. These workers are often under supervision of a clinician and can perform door-to-door assessments. They can be trained to assist with contact tracing by collecting information on symptoms and progression of infection, following up with contacts and testing, as necessary. They can also distribute educational materials, as well as food and other essential items to community members.</p><p>Currently, not all states allow the reimbursement of services from community health workers through Medicaid, but advocates are pressing governments to consider doing so as part of a covid-19 resilience strategy. Community health workers can also serve as an opportunity for employment for black communities that have been hardest hit.</p><p>Ultimately, in the long term, federal, state and local agencies will need to fully address the social determinants of health, including access to health care, education, employment and housing, of which structural racism is a key driving force. In the meantime, states and localities will need to innovate and collaborate with black communities around solutions to the pandemic. Now is the time for public health officials, by using community engagement, to repair broken bonds and reaffirm black Americans that our lives matter.</p><p>             Uch\u00e9 Blackstock is an emergency medicine physician and founder and chief executive of Advancing Health Equity.          </p><p>For more than 350,000 people in the United States, one essential activity is a daily visit to a methadone clinic to treat their opioid addictions. This is a staggering logistical feat in regular times, and now it is even more difficult for patients to get their dose of the potentially lifesaving medication.</p><p>Before the pandemic, access to methadone clinics was already limited. More than 90 percent of methadone clinics are in urban areas, making it hard for rural patients to get treatment. Now, many clinics have decreased hours, and some small facilities stopped accepting new patients altogether. Patients must also worry about exposure. There are reports of methadone clinics with crowded waiting rooms as well as clinics that allow people testing positive for the novel coronavirus to pick up medications in person.</p><p>Meanwhile, opioid overdoses are rising. One hard-hit county recently reported that overdoses were up 50 percent from last year.</p><p>We have an alternative. Methadone vans are clinics on wheels that typically serve patients in rural and underserved urban areas. Evidence suggests operating a methadone van costs roughly $300,000 less than a brick-and-mortar clinic over five years. Deploying methadone vans is a cost-effective way to replace the reduced treatment capacity created by the pandemic.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Drug Enforcement Administration stopped licensing new methadone vans in 2007. Only eight are in operation today.</p><p>The DEA recently proposed to lift the ban on new methadone vans. The proposal is a step in the right direction, but it will take significant time to finalize the regulation. The DEA can move faster. Under the Controlled Substances Act, the DEA can approve methadone vans now, just as it did before, with security requirements to ensure methadone does not end up in the wrong hands.</p><p>For Americans fighting addiction, the pandemic has made life exceptionally challenging. They deserve every tool possible to combat the two crises, including these lifesaving clinics on wheels.</p><p>             Laura Stanley is a senior policy analyst at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center.          </p><p>Along with the massive government spending to respond to the novel coronavirus crisis come massive opportunities for fraud. The Justice Department has announced that pursuing covid-19-related crime will be a top priority. But features of the criminal-justice system that are incompatible with social distancing threaten to grind that system to a halt. As one solution, we should allow federal grand juries to meet remotely.</p><p>The Fifth Amendment requires a grand jury indictment for all federal felonies, and grand jury subpoenas are the critical investigative tools for obtaining testimony, documents and other evidence. But a grand jury consists of 20 or so people gathered together in a room for hours each day. Such activity might not be safe for some time - which helps explain why the number of new federal criminal cases has dropped precipitously in recent months.</p><p>Unlike a criminal trial, a grand jury hearing could be readily adapted to a remote format. The proceeding consists only of the grand jurors, prosecutor and witness - no defendant, no defense attorney and no judge. At a trial, the accused has the right to confront witnesses and present evidence, but those rights do not apply in the grand jury. As long as the grand jury hears the government's evidence, deliberates and determines probable cause, no rights of a criminal defendant would be implicated by not having jurors in the same room.</p><p>Grand jury testimony could be conducted with the prosecutor and witness in one room (a safe distance apart) and the grand jurors watching remotely from home. Grand jurors could ask questions either directly or by sending them to the prosecutor through a chat function. Exhibits could be shared on the prosecutor's screen. When the presentation of evidence is concluded, the grand jury could deliberate and vote via a remote meeting conducted by the grand jury foreperson.</p><p>The greatest concern would be security. The secrecy of these proceedings must be preserved, but this is manageable. The remote connection would have to be closed and secure. Grand jurors may have to keep their cameras on and attest that they are alone and will maintain confidentiality. Breaches of grand jury secrecy would, as always, be punishable by contempt of court.</p><p>Remote grand juries would not solve the more challenging problem of how to conduct criminal trials, but the vast majority of cases are resolved short of trial. It would be a huge step in enabling federal criminal cases - including those related to the virus response - to move forward.</p><p>             Randall D. Eliason teaches white-collar criminal law at George Washington University Law School. He blogs at Sidebarsblog.com.          </p><p>As the potentially devastating impact of covid-19 on the incarcerated becomes clear, the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) reacted by banning visits to inmates. Criminal defense attorneys nationwide are struggling to represent inmates they cannot meet in person. The BOP has needlessly made this harder through its long-standing policy of insisting that inmates \"voluntarily\" waive all claims to confidentiality in emails they send their lawyers through the BOP-provided email system. If ever there was a time to end this policy, it is now.</p><p>Federal prosecutors have argued that alternative methods of communication are available to inmates. But nothing is as fast and cheap as email. The American Bar Association has found it can take \"two weeks or more for an inmate to receive postal mail sent from an attorney.\" Arranging an unmonitored attorney-client telephone call can take up to a month. And in-person visits, which are likewise time-consuming and difficult to arrange, are no longer an option.</p><p>This year Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation to prohibit the BOP from monitoring attorney-inmate emails identified as privileged. Even before covid-19, the bill had 23 co-sponsors (11 of them Republicans) and unanimously passed out of the House Judiciary Committee. It now awaits a full vote in the House.</p><p>The bill provides a simple and effective solution, requiring the BOP to exclude from its monitoring the contents of any privileged communication. The usual limitations to the attorney-client privilege apply (such as when a person enlists an attorney to perpetuate a crime or fraud), and law enforcement must obtain a warrant when it wishes to access emails sent through the BOP system - just as it would have to do if it sought emails from Google or another email provider.</p><p>Changing this email system was important even before covid-19.

That's when they'll be confronted with the tax bill on that crucial lifeline. Yes, absurd as it may sound, these benefits are taxable both federally and in most states. It's long past time for that policy to end.</p><p>Weekly unemployment benefits vary by state, ranging from $190 in Puerto Rico to $823 in Massachusetts. Even the most generous isn't enough to make ends meet anywhere in the country - with or without the pandemic stimulus supplement. When you subtract federal and state withholding taxes, the amount left over to take care of bare minimums - rent, food, health insurance and job-hunting expenses - just doesn't add up. People are forced to borrow from relatives, friends, credit cards, payday lenders and pawnshops and descend into debt. Take the amount without withholding, and you're left with what could be a hefty tax bill in April.</p><p>Unemployment insurance didn't start out as taxable income when it was introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. It only became fully taxable with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 under President Ronald Reagan. A few studies by conservative economists and think tanks at the time suggested that the benefits encouraged people not to look for new jobs. The idea was sold to the legislators they advised and influenced, and it has driven policy and discussion ever since. In fact, many conservatives still believe that the program, like the food stamp program, allows recipients to live in comfort.</p><p>Other studies show the opposite. Unemployment insurance, as stingy as it is, prevents people from sinking into greater poverty and keeps money circulating within the economy. Taxing these benefits treats the unemployed like slackers out to bilk the American taxpayers. Now is the time to end it.</p><p>             Toni L. Kamins is a freelance writer who lives in New York City.          </p><p>As covid-19 makes human contact more of a concern, the need for self-driving vehicles and automated delivery technologies is clear. Now, we need the policies to match.</p><p>\"Contactless\" deliveries are already limiting the spread of infection and protecting those most at risk, but we have the technology to do more. For example, the United States has not fully realized the potential of drones, technology that is hindered by a patchwork of state laws that create confusion for drone operators. Widespread use depends on the development of new operational rules and the remote identification of drones.</p><p>Self-driving cars are similarly facing roadblocks because of conflicting state rules, testing restrictions and federal limitations. As I testified before a House subcommittee in February, these vehicles have the potential to boost the economy, save lives, aid seniors and those with disabilities, and provide critical services. But the effort to advance this technology has been caught up in politics, especially by trial lawyers concerned about fewer car accidents and fewer lawsuits.</p><p>This is unfortunate, since the industry is poised to do a lot of good in this crisis. Innovators such as Waymo and Nuro are partnering with retailers and shipping companies to test self-driving delivery. Sidewalk delivery is happening in select areas by companies including Starship Technologies, and medical supplies and covid-19 tests are being delivered to the Mayo Clinic in Florida by self-driving vehicles, thanks to a partnership among Beep, NAVYA and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority.</p><p>While we must be deliberate when safety is involved, adapting outdated laws and rules to fit innovation has to be a top priority in the coming months and years. Congress should pass a self-driving-vehicle bill and enable broader testing and deployment of automated technologies. States should not create different rules that limit these technologies. Especially now, we urgently need national policies that enable the public to access the best technology at the lowest risk.</p><p>             Gary Shapiro is president and chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association. He is the author of \"Ninja Future: Secrets to Success in the New World of Innovation.\"          </p><p>Local governments are cash-strapped. Even if Congress agrees to give them financial support, it probably won't be enough. Localities must raise revenue using the fiscal tools available to them - but without overburdening struggling households. The answer is a progressive property tax. The tax could feature rates that increase with property values, income-based tax relief or deferral of payment. Many states provide such deferrals to senior citizens and the disabled, and this could be extended to those eligible for unemployment benefits.</p><p>Not only is a progressive property tax fair, but it can help stabilize household finances. Homeowners are far from being universally wealthy; more than 15 percent earn less than half of their area's median income. Since tax rates would fall with home prices during a recession, households would have more to spend on the goods and services that keep people employed. Our research shows that cutting property taxes in a recession increases spending and reduces mortgage defaults.</p><p>Raising property taxes for those who can afford it is better than the alternatives. Increases in sales taxes reduce economy-sustaining consumer spending, and if localities can't raise revenue from taxes they may turn to fines, fees and charges, which raise less revenue and often disparately impact vulnerable populations.</p><p>Property tax reform faces legal and political barriers. Most localities need state permission to tax. State legislatures should move quickly to delegate more tax authority to localities. Seventeen states also require cities and counties to hold public hearings and notify taxpayers in print before taxes increase. To reduce costs and avoid public gatherings, states should allow localities to satisfy these requirements electronically.</p><p>In our partisan climate, it may be too much to ask citizens to help those in other states, but they may be willing to help carry their neighbors' burdens. A progressive property tax is the way.</p><p>             Andrew Hayashi is Class of 1948 professor of scholarly research in law at University of Virginia.

Thankfully, the Constitution gives the president, and numerous state constitutions grant governors, a mechanism to address this crisis: the power to issue \"reprieves.\"</p><p>A reprieve - the temporary suspension of a sentence - would not be a statement that a prisoner is guiltless or rehabilitated. It would simply be a recognition that the prisoner's sentence was one of imprisonment, not death, and that his or her temporary release during the covid-19 state of emergency avoids further spread of the disease.</p><p>No matter how conscientiously prisons follow recommended precautions from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, they cannot remain safe places for either staff or prisoners. As of the end of April, eight of the top 10 clusters of coronavirus outbreaks in the United States were in prisons or jails. Though the Justice Department and various state correctional departments have expanded their use of home detention, these administrative efforts are proving insufficient to avoid both unnecessary prisoner deaths and staff exporting the disease back into their communities.</p><p>Reprieves need not be granted indiscriminately, as the suitable candidates can be easily distinguished from unsuitable. Further, conditions can be imposed on those granted reprieves, including that they remain quarantined after release. The president or a governor could even grant modest reductions in sentence terms to assure compliance.</p><p>The constitutional authority to issue reprieves is an old constitutional medicine that deserves a new use.</p><p>             Norman Reimer is executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

Throughout the country, prisons have prohibited in-person visitation to stop the spread of covid-19. Unfortunately, they have failed to enact measures to ensure that the incarcerated and their families can maintain contact.</p><p>Prison reform advocates have demanded free prison communications for nearly 20 years. It's time we finally make the investment.</p><p>Communication with incarcerated loved ones is more vital now than ever. Inside prisons, fear about heightened risks of infection and limited access to families is raising concerns of possible unrest and riots. Outside, national unemployment rates soar, yet contact remains prohibitively expensive. One study found that the cost of visits and exorbitantly priced calls contributed to 1 in 3 families with incarcerated loved ones falling into debt. It can cost up to $25 to make a 15-minute phone call to an incarcerated person.</p><p>Why? Because the $1.2 billionc prison telecommunications industry is controlled by two companies, Securus Technologies and Global Tel Link Corp., which have been granted exclusive contracts in exchange for highly profitable commissions. These companies charge high prices because they can, which is why one Connecticut resident reported spending $500 each month just to talk to her imprisoned husband.</p><p>Economic self interest, if not empathy, should spur us to action. Overwhelming research shows that increased contact between loved ones and those in prison reduces recidivism. Our country spends an average of nearly $35,000 each year to incarcerate a single inmate. About 600,000 people are released from prisons annually; 33 percent are incarcerated again within a year. Free prison communication could reduce re-conviction and boost, not drain, states' balance sheets.</p><p>Families with incarcerated loved ones should not be forced to decide between clinging to financial security and maintaining connection. During a global pandemic, inattention to this predicament is indefensible.

Experts warn of a \"silent pandemic\" affecting those with mental health disorders. However, another pandemic is brewing - one of actual silence. In person, we silently navigate around each other. Not only are we not speaking, we aren't even looking at each other.</p><p>Humans are social creatures, and the emotional fallout from a pandemic of silence could be disastrous. I support social distancing in mitigating spread of the virus, but am increasingly concerned by the pandemic of silence. Those with mental health disorders - including depression and anxiety - may lack adequate social interactions even under the best conditions. What about now? What about people with alcohol or other substance-use disorders or who are sheltered in place in unsafe home conditions? How can they reach out in silence? How can we as friends, family, neighbors and health-care providers help?</p><p>Stay six feet apart, use appropriate protective equipment - and say hello. It seems simple, but it works. Look at and acknowledge each other. Wave. Without human interaction, we risk disconnecting from what it means to be human. We need each other. We need to watch out for those most at risk in the pandemic of silence. Use technology, including video chat, to stay connected. Connect with someone you haven't in a while. If you are a provider, offer video \"check-in\" appointments with your patients or use the time to create an app so your patients can have an alternative way to connect.

As we rebuild from covid-19, recommitting to service - and scaling up AmeriCorps, in particular - should play a key role in our recovery. Doing so would not only help young people who will be disproportionately affected by joblessness, but also serve as a lifeline for communities hardest hit by the virus.</p><p>For starters, AmeriCorps members can help supply the \"army\" of contact tracers needed to slow the spread of covid-19. This labor-intensive work, while critical, does not require public-health expertise, meaning members could be trained as tracers and dispersed across the country, working in partnership with local health departments.</p><p>Beyond contact tracing, members could provide direct support to communities in fields such as education, economic well-being and disaster response. Indeed, many AmeriCorps organizations have already shifted their models because of covid-19. More than half of Stockton Service Corps are now focused on emergency relief efforts, such as powering a telephone hotline connecting seniors with essential services.</p><p>Much as in the wake of the Great Recession, AmeriCorps could provide employment opportunities to young people entering into a largely nonexistent job market. Plus, evidence shows that the program is a successful talent pipeline into public service and is cost effective, with each dollar invested returning more than $3.50 to society.</p><p>While AmeriCorps is well suited to aid our recovery, we need to first reform the program and greatly increase our investment in it. Congress should fund 250,000 AmeriCorps positions this year, dedicating new members to areas most in need. It should increase living allowances and temporarily waive the requirement that groups raise a \"match\" from local or private funds.</p><p>Expanding AmeriCorps in the wake of covid-19 is far from a silver bullet. But national service must be a part of our recovery. Doing so can help restore confidence in our public institutions and government. It can hasten our return to society, deliver direct support to communities and provide employment and training pathways for young American.

Hence the news last week that Major League Baseball is considering starting play at empty spring training fields in Phoenix and possibly Florida.</p><p>You can't blame the league for thinking outside the diamond to preserve as much of the season as possible, as anything less than a full 162 games- for a game of inches in which individual and team performances demand to be measured against that number - will forever feel tainted. But games in ghostly ballparks to start the season would be a sad reminder of our collective sense of alienation and is no way to connect with fans.</p><p>The flaw in MLB's contingency plans is in assuming that the season must wrap up when it traditionally has, in early fall, before the weather turns cold. It doesn't.</p><p>The league has 11 stadiums spanning time zones and divisions that are either domed or have average daytime temps in the upper 60s in December - in Phoenix; Anaheim, Calif.; Los Angeles; San Diego; Seattle; Milwaukee; Houston; Arlington, Tex.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Miami and Toronto. These cities afford the league an opportunity to commence the season once the country is back on its feet - say, in June, when players can conceivably report for duty in their home ballparks in front of some number of fans. Then, as the season progresses deep into fall, the aforementioned cities would be designated the home of two additional teams (accounting for all 30 teams), and host up to three games per day.</p><p>Of course, covid-19 might still be with us by then, but unlike calls to play at spring training facilities, this arrangement buys the league vital time and can accommodate worst- and best-case scenarios.</p><p>Teams (ideally in a revenue-sharing arrangement) would at a minimum generate more returns than playing for zero fans in Arizona and Florida.

Because the program was launched so quickly, there was a lot of confusion among both small businesses and lenders about eligibility, loan size and documentation. And not enough money was authorized, leaving many small businesses high and dry.</p><p>I'm optimistic the House will pass legislation to add more money to the program. But there is a better way for us to keep people on payroll: short-time compensation.</p><p>When businesses need to cut costs to survive during a recession, they often look at reducing the size of their workforce. If they need to cut labor costs by 40 percent, they might let go 40 percent of their workforce. But what if instead, they cut everyone's hours by 40 percent without firing anybody?</p><p>That's where short-time compensation comes in, as former vice president Joe Biden has proposed. The government can pay for lost hours if a company - because of a recession or national emergency - temporarily moves workers to part time rather than firing them. In the case of covid-19, the government could be paying 100 percent of the lost hours for certain industries, which is what we are trying to do indirectly with the Paycheck Protection Program.</p><p>It's a win-win-win. Workers maintain compensation, the dignity of work, their skills and their benefits. Companies benefit by maintaining their workforce and avoiding the frictional costs of needing to rehire and retrain new workers after the down cycle. And the United States benefits by keeping the labor market intact and stemming surges in use of other social safety net programs.</p><p>This idea not only has bipartisan support; it is proven. Germany has had it for years, and during the financial crisis, when U.S. employment fell 5.6 percent, German employment fell a mere 0.5 percent, despite the German economy being more hard-hit.

Let's go further and enact a Covid-19 Heroes Fund.</p><p>Health-care workers often report that their greatest worry is for their families - that they might bring covid-19 home. But they also fear for their family's financial security if they succumb to this disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 9,000 health-care workers have tested positive for the virus, more than 180 were admitted to intensive care units and 27 died. This is almost certainly a significant undercount.</p><p>Congress should immediately enact a fund to award the family of health-care workers who die of covid-19 at least $250,000; serious physical injury from the virus should also be compensated. A similar compensation program for families of law-enforcement officers killed in the line of duty has existed for decades. The families of health-care workers should receive no less.</p><p>Health-care workers are not the only essential workers at increased risk for covid-19. We hear daily about workers in meat plants, supermarkets and the transportation sector who contract the disease. A compensation program for these workers will be more complicated, but fairness requires examination of what these workers are owed as well. In the meantime, data systems should track the disease's impact on workers in all essential sectors.</p><p>No amount of money can compensate for the loss of a loved one. But this fund would be tangible evidence of this nation's gratitude to those heroes who sacrifice so much to save our lives.</p><p>             Ruth Faden is founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.          </p><p>The covid-19 crisis has revealed a huge opportunity for improving our government. That's because a wonky policy tool - public-private partnerships - has become much more important during the pandemic. The problem, however, is that these are being deployed in an ad hoc, uncoordinated manner, with too little thought given to how they fit the needs of our democratic society. What's missing is an effective structure for how we could best use the promise of these partnerships in a modern, new government.</p><p>To fill this hole, the government should create an office of public-private partnerships that can field a diverse array of potential commitments; share them throughout the federal, state and local governments; and ensure transparency.</p><p>What might some of the ground rules of this office be? First, it's not good for a democracy to let decisions of interest to the public be made in secret by privately interested forces. The \"public\" part of public-private partnerships should be paramount. Public partnerships should have the imprimatur of the whole community and fit within overall national, state and local goals. A good partnership is one that doesn't replace democratic decision-making but acts under its guidance and is transparent to all.</p><p>Second, we can do better than the ad hoc way most states and the federal government put together partnerships. That approach misses opportunities and leads to overlaps of effort when we can least afford it. The staff of a national office should be skilled at building, coordinating and evaluating partnerships.</p><p>Right now, if you can help make masks, testing kits or deliver food, you are left to your own devices to find what agency partner to reach out to. And more fundamentally, you must try and figure out what problem you can help solve, and how to best help solve it. Often on your own.</p><p>This doesn't have to be the case. A new national office could build relationships with private and nonprofit leaders and set guidelines to avoid self-dealing. That way, government will be ready when a problem arises so partnerships can be quickly discussed and activated.</p><p>             Tom Freedman was senior adviser to President Bill Clinton.

Approximately 25 percent of Americans do not have a primary care doctor, in many cases because of geographic, financial, physical or child-care-related obstacles. To alleviate some of these problems, many medical professionals across the country have already been experimenting with managing patients virtually through videoconference, phone or email.</p><p>But Congress must do more to assure that every American has access to telemedicine. That will save lives now and in the future.</p><p>As covid-19 makes visiting health-care centers more dangerous, doctors are using telehealth to provide not only medical advice but also a vital human connection. Telehealth also allows for increased access to critical mental-health-care services. When doctors deliver physical and mental health services in tandem, health outcomes improve.</p><p>Swift and decisive government action must expedite the shift to telemedicine. Doctors need affordable and secure video conferencing, access to electronic patient records and the ability to collaborate with other doctors remotely. And every American must have at least a smartphone and high-speed broadband at home. On both ends of the doctor-patient virtual relationship, Congress must allocate additional funding. We estimate $75 billion would achieve the goal.</p><p>It is imperative that we work to bring affordable high-speed connectivity to every health-care provider and American in parallel with efforts to invent and administer a vaccine. Yet, no single agency has the mission of simultaneously solving both sides of the shift of the doctor-patient relationship from the real to the virtual sphere. To this end, Congress should establish a nonpartisan commission of health-care and telecom tech experts.

Caught in the middle are patients who must choose between hospitalization, which risks infection and low-quality care due to lack of staff and space, and forgoing hospital care.</p><p>There is a third option: hospitalizing patients at home. Years of research have proved \"hospital-at-home\" programs to be safe and have lower rates of complications and death for a wide range of conditions - including pneumonia, the most common reason for hospitalization for covid-19.</p><p>Here's how it could work: Patients who need hospital-level care for any reason would be evaluated by a home-based hospitalist service to assess whether the patient is appropriate for hospital-at-home and facilitate the necessary staff and equipment. If the patient has covid-19, this may include wireless monitors to measure personal oxygen levels, home oxygen and protective gear for family members. Thereafter, the patient would receive 24/7 nursing care at home and be seen by a doctor daily using a combination of in-person and virtual visits, until they were ready to be \"discharged.\"</p><p>The benefits of such a model are many. One, during a pandemic, hospitals may carry the greatest risk of spreading the virus. Two, hospital-at-home allows for family members and loved ones to be present, which is impossible in most hospitals today due to infection risks. Three, through advanced technology such as remote monitoring, doctors can manage patients safely and even more efficiently, which is critical given the current shortage of medical staff and resources.</p><p>We just might find that moving more patients out of hospitals into the home setting could become part of a new normal that is worth keeping beyond this crisis.</p><p>             Kavita Patel is an internal medicine physician in Washington, who served as a policy director in the Obama White House and /a senior staff member to Sen.

This technique has been successfully used for viruses in the past, including the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, H1N1 and Ebola. Those who have survived covid-19 to date, myself included, did so because their bodies created the proper antibodies to fight it off. Now, we survivors need to do our part by sharing those antibodies - our own internally created hazmat suit - to help others. By donating plasma to be transferred into patients whose bodies are not naturally creating their own antibodies, we could potentially save lives.</p><p>After I was diagnosed with covid-19, I saw that there was no central repository of information on how to donate plasma, as each scientific institution was doing its own outreach to reach the right individuals. So I created an open Facebook group as a method of quickly connecting survivors with research institutions that are trying to recruit convalescent plasma donors, as well as to the many other research studies focused on the questions that need to be answered about this novel virus.</p><p>Today, our group, Survivor Corps, has more than 22,000 members. But why stop there? Those who have contracted covid-19 and recovered should take up the call to become plasma donors.

Changing the law could help.</p><p>The estimated 12-to-18-month timeframe for getting a vaccine to market is largely because of safety and efficacy testing required by the Food and Drug Administration. Legislation could shorten that timeframe without compromising the science - if the testing process tolerates more risk on volunteer study participants.</p><p>The FDA's long-standing approval process places a premium on keeping human subjects safe. For most problems, this represents a prudent calibration of risks and benefits. For the coronavirus, however, the tradeoffs are different. The general public faces imminent danger from a virus capable of exponential growth.</p><p>Over the years, Congress has repeatedly, and rightly, stepped in with legislation to speed the process. Now, Congress should act to sharpen the curve of innovation against covid-19 by pushing the FDA to suspend its rules and practices and navigate according to the judgment of its experts.</p><p>Regular FDA approval processes begin human testing with a phase-one trial that must run its course with a small number of subjects - studying safety before enrolling subjects for larger phase-two and phase-three trials to assess a vaccine's effectiveness. Yet clinical trial phases that are typically sequential could be combined or overlapped.</p><p>Collapsing trial phases without compromising scientific standards will require exposing more individuals to uncertain risk. Yet to do otherwise in a rapidly expanding pandemic leaves the global population exposed to a bureaucratically protracted period of pandemic risk without medical mitigation.</p><p>In the current crisis, it is ethically defensible to expedite clinical research with the cooperation of well-informed and consenting clinical subjects. There is no \"safe\" choice; it's a risk-risk tradeoff - a question of more risk for research subjects or a longer wait for an approved vaccine.</p><p>We should respect the will of selfless individuals to knowingly take on the risks of investigational vaccines as an act of service for the sake of ending the pandemic.</p><p>             Eric.

This is a good start, but we shouldn't overlook another promising source of help: former military medics and hospital corpsmen.</p><p>Under current state rules, highly skilled military medical experts - the same people who have patched up severely wounded soldiers and prescribed medication to those overseas - are cast aside upon returning home from service and made to start their training all over again in the civilian world. In fact, former medics are the fourth-most unemployed category among Army veterans. Out of frustration, many have pursued other careers with lower barriers to entry.</p><p>As a nation, we are wasting the enormous investment in medical training and experience each one these veterans represents in deference to an obsolete, state-level certification regime. Last I checked, care for the human body does not change whether you serve in the military or not.</p><p>Governors should use the terms of their public-health emergencies to waive or at least streamline state-level requirements for recently separated corpsman and medics, allowing them to immediately serve in health-care roles for which they are already qualified, such as emergency medical technicians or paramedics. While this is an emergency action, in the long-term, this type of change should be made permanent, so our country never again wastes the incredible educational and experiential investment we have already made in some of our nation's finest citizens.</p><p>The covid-19 pandemic has brought to the fore our failure to match medical talent with need. We can solve this problem. Allowing these medics to work in their fields would be good for our veterans and good for America.</p><p>             Dan Goldenberg is a retired U.S. Navy captain and the executive director of the Call of Duty Endowment.          </p><p>An interstate compact would fill the vacuum of federal leadership. Although comprehensive federal action would be best, the Trump administration only belatedly encouraged a nationwide shutdown, and it resists efforts to coordinate medical supplies and testing. The result is a \"50-state anarchy.\"</p><p>Leaving each state to its own devices imperils us all. When states compete with each other, medical supplies go to the highest bidder or the most influential, rather than to states with the greatest need. Piecemeal policies cannot establish a testing regime to restart the economy after the viral peaks have passed.</p><p>The states should recognize the public health of their citizens as a collective good that they have the constitutional power to protect. Rather than banging their heads against the sandstone walls of the White House, they should form an interstate compact.</p><p>The National Center on Interstate Compacts counts 200-plus state agreements on civil defense, transportation, environmental conservation and more. In fact, an Emergency Medical Services Compact already coordinates cross-border licensing and extends to coronavirus responses.</p><p>States in a new compact would agree to uniform shutdown, quarantine and testing protocols. Their reward would be an interstate supply network that enhances their bargaining power and thwarts bidding wars and price gouging. The compact would increase access to testing, too.</p><p>The bipartisan National Governors Association could organize the compact. Its chair, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), could drive the effort with its vice chair, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), as co-pilot.</p><p>The Compact Clause of the Constitution requires Congress to approve some interstate compacts, but not all. The Supreme Court has upheld multistate tax compacts adopted without congressional consent. The clause only forbids state agreements that interfere with the exercise of federal power, which is sorely lacking here.</p><p>As President Trump drags his feet, the states can't wait.

When these people recover, most are likely to be immune. Many are unemployed. It need not be so.</p><p>America needs a Covid-19 Recovery Corps, now.</p><p>Survivors of the 2003 SARS epidemic, caused by a related coronavirus, appear immune to reinfection for a year or more. Although studies are urgently needed, all the experts, including Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, believe covid-19 immunity is likely similar.</p><p>Covid-19 survivors are a critical resource, both to perform tasks that non-immune individuals cannot safely do and to get the economy moving. To enlist them, the federal government should immediately create a CRC modeled on New Deal programs such as the Works Progress Administration.</p><p>CRC associates could perform essential support roles in hospitals: preparing and delivering meals, transporting patients and samples, helping to clean. They could staff drive-through testing centers so health-care workers wouldn't have to. They could care for, teach and tutor children whose parents must work. They could assist in places where physical distancing is impossible, such as nursing homes. They could deliver food to people who are self-isolating. They could go door-to-door as census workers.</p><p>Congress and the president will have to muster the political will and cooperation needed to establish a major new program. A mechanism will also be needed to certify who is a survivor. Soon, we will have a serological blood test to determine who has antibodies against the coronavirus. Until then, we will have to confirm active infection followed by resolution of symptoms, passage of time or repeat viral testing.</p><p>Americans need work, and there's plenty of work to be done by people immune to the virus.

And if you are able, I think you should, too.</p><p>There are an estimated 130 million Americans in the middle class. Consider: If even 20,000 stimulus recipients chose to pool our $1,200 checks, we would create the grass-roots equivalent of a $24 million micro-bank. That's some serious grant-making power.</p><p>What could this look like? Pass your payment along to someone whose services you normally utilize - a barber, a nail technician, a house cleaner - whose work has evaporated. Donate to a reputable organization channeling resources to affected households. Buy gift cards to local businesses. Those are just a few ideas. A friend and I have created a website to help people make high-impact donations. It also shares resources for those in need.</p><p>Megan Greene, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School, has advocated for wide-reaching stimulus checks.

To avoid this foreseeable calamity, Congress should immediately authorize a substantial increase in federal bankruptcy judgeships to handle the load and ensure that our economic courts of last resorts can meet their critical obligations.</p><p>A company's ability to restructure its debt and obtain a fresh start is a fundamental tenet of U.S. corporate law. Our system has worked in past downturns, allowing businesses of every type to reorganize and save jobs rather than wither and liquidate. In a real sense, U.S. bankruptcy courts and judges are the hospitals and doctors for ailing businesses, and they must be sufficiently staffed and supported. Without more bankruptcy judges to face what some predict could be as much as a fourfold increase in cases, the system will be hard-pressed to carry out its mission.</p><p>In this time of growing crisis, the need for additional bankruptcy judges is especially acute in venues that may face heavier volumes of filings. And Congress should amend current law so that bankruptcy judges can temporarily serve anywhere in the country, not just intheir home districts.</p><p>Liberals and conservatives ought to come together on this issue. Bankruptcy courts cannot be packed with ideologues by the president or the Senate; bankruptcy judges do not have life tenure and are selected by other judges, not politicians. Historically, this has been done with great care and has led to an exceptionally high-quality pool of capable bankruptcy judges with extensive subject-matter expertise. Our judiciary can fill new judgeships in the same way now to meet our needs.</p><p>The United States has seen the costs of failing to prepare before a crisis spins out of control. Appointing additional bankruptcy judges before the bankruptcy system is inundated is a low-cost proposition with significant benefits. Failing to prepare leaves systems overwhelmed and lets contagion spread.

There has been a lot of talk about voting by mail - but we're missing a critical piece of the democracy puzzle. We need to ensure every eligible citizen not only can cast their ballot safely but also obtain a ballot in the first place. The best solution is to skip voter registration altogether and send a ballot to every eligible citizen for the November election - not just to registered voters.</p><p>Even in a normal cycle, only about 60 percent of eligible voters take part in our elections. Civic groups and political parties spend millions of dollars and months on the ground registering voters. But this year, they won't be able to go door-to-door or set up shop outside supermarkets to register voters due to social distancing guidelines. By ending voter registration, we'll not only protect our democracy, but we'll also give it the vital boost it needs.</p><p>This is especially critical because registration is already used as a tool to suppress the vote. Before recent elections, we've seen Georgia, Indiana and Ohio purge hundreds of thousands of people from voter rolls. Without bold action, we can expect an election that isn't just unrepresentative but is also delegitimizing of the next government's response to the multiple crises we will face.</p><p>We already have the resources to make sure everyone can vote. The government has records, such as Social Security numbers, that could serve as voter rolls when individuals turn 18. State agencies - such as the Department of Motor Vehicles - have this information as well.</p><p>With only a fraction of Americans choosing their leaders, our democracy is already extremely fragile. We can come out of this pandemic with democracy on a lifeline, with a select few choosing our next president, or we can act now and have a healthier democracy when this ends. Wouldn't that be the best silver lining?</p><p>             Ellen Kurz is founder and chief executive the voting-rights advocacy group, iVote.          </p><p>At a White House Coronavirus Task Force news conference on March 19, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams outlined one action that young people like us can take to help our country during the coronavirus: \"We know many of you are home practicing the president's guidelines for social distancing, but one thing we should all consider, especially our millennials and Gen Z, is donating blood.\"</p><p>Dr. Adams, we hear you and we want to help. The Red Cross is asking for blood donations, as thousands of drives have been canceled across the country because of coronavirus fears. Our country is facing a dire blood shortage, and yet we, along with millions of other healthy gay men, are being turned away.</p><p>At the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration barred gay men from donating blood. In 2014, the FDA modified this ban to prevent gay men from giving blood if they have had any sexual contact within the past year, even if they test negative for HIV, practice safe sex and are in a monogamous relationship. Meanwhile, straight men and women, all of whom are capable of having HIV, face no restrictions on blood donation (even if they engage in risky sexual activity).</p><p>It is long past time to lift this discriminatory policy. Other countries, such as Italy and Spain, have moved toward individual risk assessments rather than discriminatory bans on gay men, and have faced no issues with HIV in the blood supply. The United States is in a national crisis: the coronavirus threatens our health-care system, and a blood shortage only adds to the stress. We call on President Trump to sign an executive order revising the blanket restriction to an individual risk assessment, accounting for HIV testing and safe sex practices. This is an opportunity for the administration to respond quickly and effectively to our current crisis. Millions of gay men want to help. Please let us.</p><p>             Kevin Ballen and Reese Caldwell are sophomores at Harvard College studying sociology and molecular and cellular biology, respectively.          </p><p>As the coronavirus crisis puts intense pressure on the health-care system, the Veterans Affairs medical system and some governors are asking doctors and nurses to come out of retirement. And in some hospitals in New York, final-year medical students are already working as clinical observers and note-takers to help manage the spread of covid-19. But there's another resource hospitals should examine: foreign-trained physicians.</p><p>There are an estimated 65,000 doctors in the United States who have not done any residency training in the country and therefore cannot be licensed to practice. Many of these doctors have extensive medical schooling and postgraduate training and possess clinical competence in diagnosing and managing infectious diseases. Due to the highly competitive nature of U.S. residency programs and restrictions from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which limits the annual number of residency slots supported by Medicare, many U.S. medical graduates and foreign-trained doctors do not make it into residency programs.</p><p>This contributes significantly to the increasing deficit in the physician workforce. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts that over the next decade, the United States will see a shortage of more than 120,000 physicians. Addressing the health-care labor shortage by asking retired nurses and doctors to come back to work may temporarily boost the health workforce, but certainly doesn't address future outbreaks. Also, these retired professionals are mostly seniors with a higher mortality risk for covid-19 in any clinic setting.</p><p>Tapping into the massive pool of foreign-trained physicians could ameliorate gaps in health-care quality resulting from a high patient-to-physician ratio, especially during health crises such as the covid-19 pandemic. The system should decide how to use these doctors, perhaps by engaging them in community preventive medicine and population health planning or offering easy paths to restricted licenses in infection prevention and control. Given the emergency before us, why would we turn away their expertise?</p><p>             Leslie Omoruyi is a foreign-trained physician and independent health-care consultant in Lynchburg, Va.</p><p>Covid-19 is straining the capacity of America's hospitals, so why not consider alternate models?</p><p>Right now, reimbursement for emergency ambulance service is tied almost exclusively to the transportation of a patient to a hospital emergency room. But it doesn't have to be that way.</p><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services have the authority to grant waivers that would compensate first responders for providing care for some patients in their homes.</p><p>Waivers could also be issued to reimburse ambulance providers who transport patients that need less intensive care to alternate destinations, such as urgent-care facilities. If a patient requires ongoing monitoring, emergency first responders can assist with ensuring regular telemedicine visits are scheduled to allow them to maintain contact with their medical teams without having to leave home - minimizing potential community spread.</p><p>This approach would reduce crowding in hospitals, allow them to preserve scarce beds for those patients who need them and ensure doctors and nurses can devote more time and resources to the patients most in need of the highest level of care.</p><p>Giving paramedics, EMTs and other front-line health-care providers priority access to personal protective equipment would also help ensure there is manpower to fuel this alternate delivery model. The national shortage of gloves, masks and other equipment put America's paramedics, EMTs and fellow first responders at an unacceptable heightened risk. It is imperative that lawmakers include a provision in the next phase of the stimulus requiring the health and human services secretary to issue guidance ensuring that ambulance providers and suppliers are given priority access to such equipment.</p><p>First responders and those we serve need government leadership and dedicated funding to support new, innovative approaches during this crisis.</p><p>             Aarron Reinert is president of the American Ambulance Association.          </p><p>Since 1986, federal law has mandated that any patient requesting emergency medical care must be evaluated by a physician to assess for any threatening conditions. The law, often referred to as the \"anti-dumping law,\" requires that physicians perform a medical screening evaluation, including a physical examination.</p><p>Over time, the interpretation of this mandate has slowly expanded, not by law so much as by custom. This is why emergency rooms have become our nation's safety net for care. Despite increasing popularity of urgent-care clinics and telehealth, many patients who could have safely been cared for elsewhere still end up in emergency rooms.</p><p>While many of us embrace that mission with pride, it is dangerous and wasteful in the coronavirus pandemic. We need to course-correct to keep everyone safe. Exposing patients to emergency rooms is now far riskier than it was before. In turn, health-care workers must assume that all patients are infected. This forces us to blow through personal protective equipment that we desperately need so that we do not become infected ourselves.</p><p>Over the past few decades, we have learned that many, if not most, of our physical examination maneuvers provide little reliable information. In most cases, the information we need can be obtained simply by interviewing patients. But old habits die hard, and patients seem to love our stethoscopes. In our current situation, that simply won't do.</p><p>We need the federal government to allow us to perform medical screening exams via video or through glass doors, even for patients entering emergency rooms. The removal of the requirement that we evaluate every patient by hand will save resources and keep everyone safer.</p><p>In recent meetings and phone calls with stakeholders, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has signaled that it is seriously considering making this change. But it has not materialized, and time is of the essence.

Even in cities under virtual lockdown, the news media has been recognized as an \"essential service\" for public health and safety, alongside hospitals and grocery stores. Local media outlets have been rising to the occasion, breaking stories, guiding the public on do's and don'ts, and holding leaders accountable for life and death decisions. Many have dropped paywalls on their covid-19 coverage, recognizing that it represents an essential public service.</p><p>But while they may seem to be thriving, local media outlets still suffer from the disintegration of longstanding, advertising-based business models. That, coupled with the mass migration of consumers to social media platforms, has stripped local news outlets of their prime source of revenue, leading to the closure of one out of every five local newspapers and the slashing of newsroom staffs in half over the past 15 years. The spread of covid-19 has made this chronic illness acute: The closure of local businesses and slowdown in economic activity are depriving local news outlets of essential revenue to keep operations going. In recent weeks, several publications have dropped print editions, or made plaintive appeals to readers for the financial support necessary to sustain operations.</p><p>As Congress and state legislatures contemplate massive stimulus bills aimed to keep our economy and society afloat, local media outlets should be part of the package. Funds to replace lost revenue and ensure that local news outlets continue to provide essential coverage of the pandemic and other topics will enable communities to stay informed, healthy and connected through this crisis. The monies need to be carefully safeguarded to ensure that the infusion of public funds does not compromise editorial integrity or deter hard-hitting coverage.

The country mobilized resources to manufacture the equipment and is now ready to export it to countries in need. On March 9, China announced it would export five million masks to South Korea. China has also provided testing kits, masks and protection suits to more than 80 countries, including Italy, France, Pakistan, Japan and Iran.</p><p>Why, then, isn't the United States buying the equipment it needs from China? Because President Trump's tariffs are standing in the way.</p><p>Since 2018, the Trump administration has imposed more than $400 billion dollars of tariffs on imports from China; $360 billion dollars of duties remain in place. Critical medical products, including face masks, gloves, protective goggles and thermometers, have been subject to Section 301 import tariffs.</p><p>The administration has offered to grant exclusions from import tariffs for certain medical products imported from China. But on March 5, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) approved just 200 specific requests from individual companies to have their purchase of items needed to handle the epidemic excluded from the tariff; some of the requests from health-care companies were denied. On March 10 and 12, the administration said it would temporarily reduce some tariffs on Chinese products to address the pandemic, yet the list covers only a handful of urgently needed products.</p><p>On March 20, USTR announced that it was considering \"possible further modifications to remove duties from additional medical care products\" related to the COVID-19 virus and would collect comments from interested parties until at least June 25.

For U.S. doctors, the statistic is even more pronounced, at 1 in 4. In the states hardest hit by coronavirus, California and New York, more than a third of all health-care workers are immigrants.</p><p>These individuals, who are being forced to work night and day as our doctors, nurses and pharmacists during our national crisis, must also confront unfair immigration provisions such as the administration's travel ban, administrative processing roadblocks, arbitrary green card caps and the new public charge rule. President Trump's policies are adding undue stress to an already stressful existence to these workers. Close to 30,000 DACA recipients are health-care workers, including 200 who are slated to be doctors, yet they will probably lose their status come June, as the Supreme Court will likely allow Trump to eliminate the program. And there are rumors that the Department of Homeland Security may be planning raids and deportations against these DACA recipients who are saving the lives of Americans.</p><p>We shouldn't ask these immigrants to risk their lives in labor for us but spend their waking hours under threat of losing their status or deportation. Trump should suspend his byzantine immigration policies for these health-care workers immediately, work with Congress to exempt health-care workers from any immigration caps and set up task forces within DHS and the State Department to expedite their current cases - whether those cases be non-immigrant visa renewals, Green card applications or naturalization.

Normally, they would begin serving patients in July, but there's a way to do it now.</p><p>If medical schools instead confer MD degrees immediately, instead of waiting until the end of the semester, these hospitals could hire, train and deploy an extra 20,000 physicians at a time when we are straining to \"flatten the curve\" of the covid-19 coronavirus. This proposal is a few weeks old and has already passed from Columbia University to New York State. But others should take up the idea of accelerating fourth-year medical students into their chosen life of service.</p><p>At Columbia, most of our medical students - representative of similar medical students throughout the country - want to help, even if it is not their time. But the fourth-year students are fully prepared. They have completed all the clinical rotations required for the MD degree. Under normal circumstances they would now be taking electives or conducting research, perhaps not even seeing a patient during the final few months of medical school. They would in the normal order receive their MDs in May and begin as interns (first-year residents) by July.</p><p>I propose instead that medical students be graduated now and given the opportunity to serve in this time of great need. I imagine most would jump at the opportunity. If they were not caring for covid-19 patients directly, they could free more experienced physicians to undertake that necessary work.</p><p>             Donald W.

For the small but significant proportion with severe or critical illness, the decision to hospitalize is trivial. But where to send the apparently large majority of cases that are mild or even symptom-free?</p><p>These patients, often young, need to be isolated to reduce spread. But using a hospital bed for isolation alone takes up capacity, puts others at risk and chews through protective equipment that doctors, nurses and other staff desperately need.</p><p>A natural alternative is to send people home, with clear instructions to self-isolate. But in some cases that is not feasible, and it poses evident risks. The World Health Organization recommends placing mildly ill patients in dedicated covid-19 facilities as the gold standard for isolation. While countries such as China have the logistical capability to erect new hospitals for this purpose in a matter of days, most places cannot achieve that.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a potential answer: America's prodigious hotel industry. And in case you haven't noticed, there is plenty of room at the inn.</p><p>The federal government should use its financial and legal resources to temporarily convert some large hotels, reeling from the current economic situation, into covid-19 isolation facilities. Under recently issued federal guidance, these spaces are not required to provide medical attention.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances, the suggestion that the federal government might seek to take over a hotel would run into serious legal objections. But under current conditions, we suspect that many hotel executives would line up to draft temporary and renewable lease agreements with the government. This could also help stave off unemployment in the travel industry.</p><p>Yes, all of this needs to be paid for, and strong steps would have to be taken to reduce health risks to housekeepers and staff.

First, it virtually guarantees that recipients will spend the cash. Facing the possibility that their stimulus cash will expire, recipients in all financial brackets will be anxious to use the money. Even the well-off will hate the idea of losing free money that they could have spent.</p><p>Second, recipients of prepaid cards can use them immediately, whereas a check needs to be deposited first. Although electronic banking with online check deposit is increasingly common, many people do not have access to such a service. And going to the bank violates infection-control guidelines.</p><p>Third, amounts on prepaid cards that are not injected into the economy can revert to the U.S. Treasury and perhaps be recycled for later use. With paper checks, the Treasury recovers only those that are not deposited, whether or not they are spent.</p><p>The fundamental principle is to increase the likelihood that spendable cash sent to consumers will be spent immediately.

Perhaps we could monitor neighbors recently discharged from hospitals. Or, in my own field, I might visit a person concerned that their facial weakness might be a stroke. A simple examination or an online consult might determine it to be a less serious Bell's palsy, potentially avoiding an emergency-room visit.</p><p>I don't know if this is practical, and I know hospitals do not have the resources to set up such a system or offer supplies right now. But with the help of social-networking services for neighborhoods, clinicians could self-organize. They could indicate their expertise, their availability and what they would be willing to do.

Research on seasonal flu comparing the accuracy of self-collected swabs vs. professionally collected swabs shows that they are nearly equivalent.</p><p>Here is how at-home testing could work:</p><p>Step 1: Individuals with symptoms call in to their doctor's office or use a telemedicine service to be assessed by a qualified health-care professional who can order tests, often billing a patient's insurance company directly.</p><p>Step 2: Those who meet CDC guidelines for testing and are able to test themselves and be safely managed at home are sent a testing kit by overnight mail or direct delivery from a nearby facility (which could include labs, pharmacies or specially set-up public-health depots).</p><p>Step 3: Individuals would then self-swab, guided by an instructional video or a virtual health-care professional, and then mail the sample to a testing facility or drop it off. All three steps could be done completely from home - not only convenient for those who are already feeling ill but also ensuring social distancing.</p><p>Governments and private organizations should issue guidance on at-home testing for clinicians, laboratories and public health professionals. Also needed: removing state and local regulatory barriers that slow down and sometimes prevent labs from processing samples collected by patients. And government and private organizations should provide funding to laboratories and researchers to invest in validating and improving the effectiveness of at-home testing.</p><p>With swift action, at-home testing could ensure widespread, equitable availability of care and slow the spread of covid-19.</p><p>             Shantanu Nundy is a primary-care physician and chief medical officer at Accolade Inc.

So we have to balance both,' he said in response to a question about China. </p><p>It comes as Google and other tech giants face withering scrutiny over privacy practices, censorship, the gutting of local journalism, and potential anti-competitive practices.</p><p>It emerged earlier this month that the Justice Department will look at Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission will probe Amazon and Facebook to determine if they abused their massive market power, setting up what could be unprecedented, wide-ranging probes of some of the world's largest companies. </p><p>Meanwhile, the House Judiciary committee is launching its own antitrust inquiry into the tech industry, including Google.</p><p>Asked about the various probes, Pinchai tried to project an air of equanimity, saying it was 'perfectly fine' for companies like Google to be scrutinized when they get big enough. </p><p>'Scrutiny is right, and we will participate constructively in these discussions,' he said.</p><p>The growing hostility to Google's market dominance has also appeared on the presidential campaign trail, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat seeking the party's nomination, explicitly promising to break the company up if elected.</p><p>'I think there needs to be healthy debate,' Pichai said when asked about Warren's vow. 'Any campaign has moments around that, but what matters to me is the healthy thoughtful conversations around it.' </p><p>'I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences,' he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested he'll take a broad view of how competition is harmed when assessing whether big tech firms should be broken up.</p><p>Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim also was clear in a speech in Israel that he is well aware that just two companies dominate digital advertising, though he did not name the two: Google and Facebook.</p><p>Without indicating whether he plans to move against any particular company, he said factors to be considered in assessing whether a monopoly exists - meriting antitrust action - go well beyond whether a company's dominance leads to higher prices</p><p>Google and Facebook's free (to consumers) services have long been used as an argument against antitrust action, with the companies arguing that their market dominance doesn't cost consumers.</p><p>'Consumers actually enjoyed lower prices during the height of Standard Oil's dominance,' Delrahim pointed out, referring to the company that was ruled an illegal monopoly and broken up in 1911.</p><p>'The current landscape suggests there are only one or two significant players in important digital spaces, including internet search, social networks, mobile and desktop operating systems, and electronic book sales,' he said in the speech, which was published on the Justice Department's website. </p><p>'This is true in certain input markets as well. For example, just two firms take in the lion's share of online ad spending.

We thought you were sensible. Then you come out with some woke hokum (wokum?) on trans rights. You tell us that violent male sex offenders who transition - including child rapists - \"should be accommodated in a prison of their choosing\". Yes, convicted rapists and sex attackers should be allowed into women's prisons, reckons Nandy. Will we be offering Ms Child Rapist an in-cell Nespresso machine and goose-down pillows, too? Increasingly the upper echelons of the Labour Party seem to be the creation of some calculating Tory millionaire who has paid a band of actors to say things so electorally repellent that the socialists will be out of power for a generation. Thank heavens, then, for the sense of Tony Blair, the traitor who had the temerity to actually win elections for Labour, who has warned his old comrades not to make transgender rights \"our big thing\", urging the party not to become an \"NGO or a pressure group\".</p><p>Woke warriors frothing about Blair's intervention would do well to remember under whose watch came the watershed for transgender rights: the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Whatever his flaws as a politician, the former Labour leader has long been a champion of equality before the law, a man who has taken serious steps to prevent people being bullied or discriminated against on account of what they are. Yet Blair can also see that for the left to indulge in culture wars with the right, to throw its entire weight behind Twitter-friendly causes, is politically disastrous. \"Our task is to win power, to get our hands stuck into the muddy mangle of governing, where out of it can be pulled the prize of progress.\"</p><p>\"The prize of progress\". This, I think, is what is behind so much of the current obsession with trans rights. While those on the right of politics tend to be more easily satisfied with incremental change, those on the left long for progress of the most dramatic kind: revolutions ignited, injustices righted, shackles thrown off the poor and oppressed. Those on the left yearn to hold aloft the prize of progress, to say: \"I was at the march ... I organised the boycott ... I helped pass the law ... I campaigned for the reforms ... that tipped the scales from injustice to justice\". They want to be Rosa Parks on the bus, the man in front of the tank in Tiananmen Square.</p><p>In decades past those on the left had clear and grievous wrongs to fight - such as the criminalisation of homosexuality or grossly unequal pay for women - and left-wing activists today want to win their own progressive stripes. Trouble is, as the decades roll on, there are fewer clear-cut fights to fight. A lot of the old villains have been successfully slain by regulations, laws or cultural change. The greedy boss class has been chastened by workplace rules, the overtly racist and homophobic brought to heel by equality legislation, the misogynist dinosaurs humbled by the rise of professional, capable women. Yes, there remain inequalities and subtle prejudice but the causes of these things are more muddy than they used to be. In terms of solutions that are in the gift of government, low-hanging fruit is very scarce.</p><p>That is why the left is making a great crusade of trans rights: they believe they have found fresh territory to \"take\" in the name of progress. This desire explains so many battles in the culture wars beyond trans rights. When those on the left fuss over whether a bakery will print a gay-friendly message on a cake, or whether there are sufficient numbers of non-white people in an 18th-century drama on TV, or some other seemingly minor issue, they are reaching for the glittering (and increasingly elusive) prize of progress.</p><p>Yet we cannot simply blame the left for our current preoccupation with identity politics. It takes two sides to fight the culture wars, and we who feel part of what might be termed \"the sensible majority\" are increasingly absorbed with all this too. Of course, sometimes these culture war issues matter, as in the case of violent trans offenders being admitted to women's prisons. Yet often the storms that fill column inches don't really matter at all: someone choosing to refer to themselves with a different pronoun, say, or the removal of \"Easter\" from chocolate eggs, or the rise of vegan products. More and more the collective attention span of our nation fixates on the trivial and the irritating at the expense of the serious and significant. And herein lies the reason for our obsession with the culture wars. In an age of huge problems that seem impossible to solve - climate change, uncontrolled migration, cyberwarfare, automation - there is comfort to be had in arguing over what is relatively trivial.</p><p>Human beings are primed to fix problems. In our hunter-gatherer days we lived in communities of no more than about 150; a small enough number to discuss and confront problems together, be they scarcity or sabre-toothed tigers. Today's challenges defeat communities of millions. Their causes lie beyond our borders, our jurisdiction, our understanding. Psychologists warn that eco-anxiety is on the rise because what, really, can we usefully do? Recycling plastic bottles is noble but hardly game-changing. Many across the West worry about the impact of migration on public services but, again, as individuals we are powerless. The march of the machines leaves many uneasy about the impact on jobs, livelihoods and happiness but what can we as individuals do about the relentless \"progress\" of technology? Our own governments are in thrall to big tech because they don't truly understand it. We are overwhelmed, we are impotent, we are tiny flotsam floating in the wake of forces beyond our control. In this age of complexity, we seek refuge in simplicities - and the culture wars can seem blissfully simple. Here are problems we feel we really can solve, whether we are woke warriors on Twitter piling on to some hapless person for making an unthinking (and career-ending) remark, or one of the sensible majority trying to speak out against the latest PC lunacy.</p><p>This impulse to fix something fixable is understandable.

We thought you were sensible. Then you come out with some woke hokum (wokum?) on trans rights. You tell us that violent male sex offenders who transition - including child rapists - \"should be accommodated in a prison of their choosing\". Yes, convicted rapists and sex attackers should be allowed into women's prisons, reckons Nandy. Will we be offering Ms Child Rapist an in-cell Nespresso machine and goose-down pillows, too?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasingly the upper echelons of the Labour Party seem to be the creation of some calculating Tory millionaire who has paid a band of actors to say things so electorally repellent that the socialists will be out of power for a generation. Thank heavens, then, for the sense of Tony Blair, the traitor who had the temerity to actually win elections for Labour, who has warned his old comrades not to make transgender rights \"our big thing\", urging the party not to become an \"NGO or a pressure group\".</p><p>Woke warriors frothing about Blair's intervention would do well to remember under whose watch came the watershed for transgender rights: the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Whatever his flaws as a politician, the former Labour leader has long been a champion of equality before the law, a man who has taken serious steps to prevent people being bullied or discriminated against on account of what they are. Yet Blair can also see that for the left to indulge in culture wars with the right, to throw its entire weight behind Twitter-friendly causes, is politically disastrous. \"Our task is to win power, to get our hands stuck into the muddy mangle of governing, where out of it can be pulled the prize of progress.\"</p><p>\"The prize of progress\". This, I think, is what is behind so much of the current obsession with trans rights. While those on the right of politics tend to be more easily satisfied with incremental change, those on the left long for progress of the most dramatic kind: revolutions ignited, injustices righted, shackles thrown off the poor and oppressed. Those on the left yearn to hold aloft the prize of progress, to say: \"I was at the march . . . I organised the boycott . . . I helped pass the law . . . I campaigned for the reforms . . . that tipped the scales from injustice to justice\". They want to be Rosa Parks on the bus, the man in front of the tank in Tiananmen Square.</p><p>In decades past those on the left had clear and grievous wrongs to fight - such as the criminalisation of homosexuality or grossly unequal pay for women - and left-wing activists today want to win their own progressive stripes. Trouble is, as the decades roll on, there are fewer clear-cut fights to fight. A lot of the old villains have been successfully slain by regulations, laws or cultural change. The greedy boss class has been chastened by workplace rules, the overtly racist and homophobic brought to heel by equality legislation, the misogynist dinosaurs humbled by the rise of professional, capable women. Yes, there remain inequalities and subtle prejudice but the causes of these things are more muddy than they used to be. In terms of solutions that are in the gift of government, low-hanging fruit is very scarce.</p><p>That is why the left is making a great crusade of trans rights: they believe they have found fresh territory to \"take\" in the name of progress. This desire explains so many battles in the culture wars beyond trans rights. When those on the left fuss over whether a bakery will print a gay-friendly message on a cake, or whether there are sufficient numbers of non-white people in an 18th-century drama on TV, or some other seemingly minor issue, they are reaching for the glittering (and increasingly elusive) prize of progress.</p><p>Yet we cannot simply blame the left for our current preoccupation with identity politics. It takes two sides to fight the culture wars, and we who feel part of what might be termed \"the sensible majority\" are increasingly absorbed with all this too. Of course, sometimes these culture war issues matter, as in the case of violent trans offenders being admitted to women's prisons. Yet often the storms that fill column inches don't really matter at all: someone choosing to refer to themselves with a different pronoun, say, or the removal of \"Easter\" from chocolate eggs, or the rise of vegan products. More and more the collective attention span of our nation fixates on the trivial and the irritating at the expense of the serious and significant. And herein lies the reason for our obsession with the culture wars. In an age of huge problems that seem impossible to solve - climate change, uncontrolled migration, cyberwarfare, automation - there is comfort to be had in arguing over what is relatively trivial.</p><p>Human beings are primed to fix problems. In our hunter-gatherer days we lived in communities of no more than about 150; a small enough number to discuss and confront problems together, be they scarcity or sabre-toothed tigers. Today's challenges defeat communities of millions. Their causes lie beyond our borders, our jurisdiction, our understanding. Psychologists warn that eco-anxiety is on the rise because what, really, can we usefully do? Recycling plastic bottles is noble but hardly game-changing. Many across the West worry about the impact of migration on public services but, again, as individuals we are powerless. The march of the machines leaves many uneasy about the impact on jobs, livelihoods and happiness but what can we as individuals do about the relentless \"progress\" of technology? Our own governments are in thrall to big tech because they don't truly understand it. We are overwhelmed, we are impotent, we are tiny flotsam floating in the wake of forces beyond our control. In this age of complexity, we seek refuge in simplicities - and the culture wars can seem blissfully simple. Here are problems we feel we really can solve, whether we are woke warriors on Twitter piling on to some hapless person for making an unthinking (and career-ending) remark, or one of the sensible majority trying to speak out against the latest PC lunacy.</p><p>This impulse to fix something fixable is understandable. But the danger is that while absorbed by culture war spats we fail to grapple with the more difficult issues before us. We fiddle while the planet burns, and while technologies develop against our interests. It is not just the Labour leadership candidates who need to prise themselves from the quagmire of the culture wars, but all of us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-60524737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8R-NR91-F021-64VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Thank heavens, then, for the sense of Tony Blair, the traitor who had the temerity to actually win elections for Labour, who has warned his old comrades not to make transgender rights \"our big thing\", urging the party not to become an \"NGO or a pressure group\".</p><p>Woke warriors frothing about Blair's intervention would do well to remember under whose watch came the watershed for transgender rights: the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Whatever his flaws as a politician, the former Labour leader has long been a champion of equality before the law, a man who has taken serious steps to prevent people being bullied or discriminated against on account of what they are. Yet Blair can also see that for the left to indulge in culture wars with the right, to throw its entire weight behind Twitter-friendly causes, is politically disastrous. \"Our task is to win power, to get our hands stuck into the muddy mangle of governing, where out of it can be pulled the prize of progress.\"</p><p>\"The prize of progress\". This, I think, is what is behind so much of the current obsession with trans rights. While those on the right of politics tend to be more easily satisfied with incremental change, those on the left long for progress of the most dramatic kind: revolutions ignited, injustices righted, shackles thrown off the poor and oppressed. Those on the left yearn to hold aloft the prize of progress, to say: \"I was at the march ... I organised the boycott ... I helped pass the law ... I campaigned for the reforms ... that tipped the scales from injustice to justice\". They want to be Rosa Parks on the bus, the man in front of the tank in Tiananmen Square.</p><p>In decades past those on the left had clear and grievous wrongs to fight - such as the criminalisation of homosexuality or grossly unequal pay for women - and left-wing activists today want to win their own progressive stripes. Trouble is, as the decades roll on, there are fewer clear-cut fights to fight. A lot of the old villains have been successfully slain by regulations, laws or cultural change. The greedy boss class has been chastened by workplace rules, the overtly racist and homophobic brought to heel by equality legislation, the misogynist dinosaurs humbled by the rise of professional, capable women. Yes, there remain inequalities and subtle prejudice but the causes of these things are more muddy than they used to be. In terms of solutions that are in the gift of government, low-hanging fruit is very scarce.</p><p>That is why the left is making a great crusade of trans rights: they believe they have found fresh territory to \"take\" in the name of progress. This desire explains so many battles in the culture wars beyond trans rights. When those on the left fuss over whether a bakery will print a gay-friendly message on a cake, or whether there are sufficient numbers of non-white people in an 18th-century drama on TV, or some other seemingly minor issue, they are reaching for the glittering (and increasingly elusive) prize of progress.</p><p>Yet we cannot simply blame the left for our current preoccupation with identity politics. It takes two sides to fight the culture wars, and we who feel part of what might be termed \"the sensible majority\" are increasingly absorbed with all this too. Of course, sometimes these culture war issues matter, as in the case of violent trans offenders being admitted to women's prisons. Yet often the storms that fill column inches don't really matter at all: someone choosing to refer to themselves with a different pronoun, say, or the removal of \"Easter\" from chocolate eggs, or the rise of vegan products. More and more the collective attention span of our nation fixates on the trivial and the irritating at the expense of the serious and significant. And herein lies the reason for our obsession with the culture wars. In an age of huge problems that seem impossible to solve - climate change, uncontrolled migration, cyberwarfare, automation - there is comfort to be had in arguing over what is relatively trivial.</p><p>Human beings are primed to fix problems. In our hunter-gatherer days we lived in communities of no more than about 150; a small enough number to discuss and confront problems together, be they scarcity or sabre-toothed tigers. Today's challenges defeat communities of millions. Their causes lie beyond our borders, our jurisdiction, our understanding. Psychologists warn that eco-anxiety is on the rise because what, really, can we usefully do? Recycling plastic bottles is noble but hardly game-changing. Many across the West worry about the impact of migration on public services but, again, as individuals we are powerless. The march of the machines leaves many uneasy about the impact on jobs, livelihoods and happiness but what can we as individuals do about the relentless \"progress\" of technology? Our own governments are in thrall to big tech because they don't truly understand it. We are overwhelmed, we are impotent, we are tiny flotsam floating in the wake of forces beyond our control. In this age of complexity, we seek refuge in simplicities - and the culture wars can seem blissfully simple. Here are problems we feel we really can solve, whether we are woke warriors on Twitter piling on to some hapless person for making an unthinking (and career-ending) remark, or one of the sensible majority trying to speak out against the latest PC lunacy.</p><p>This impulse to fix something fixable is understandable. But the danger is that while absorbed by culture war spats we fail to grapple with the more difficult issues before us. We fiddle while the planet burns, and while technologies develop against our interests. It is not just the Labour leadership candidates who need to prise themselves from the quagmire of the culture wars, but all of us.</p><p>As the decades roll on, there are fewer clearcut fights for the left</p><p>In this age of great complexity we seek refuge in simplicities</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair is a voice of sense on the leftZUMA PRESS/ALAMY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-157764750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8S-GHG1-DYTY-C19T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001555</classCode><className>SEX OFFENSES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY</classCode><className>Sex Crimes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D4OZ</classCode><className>CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTBBQjYwQkYwN0ZGNDQzOTlEMjIyRDEyMkE1RTAwRjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk</classCode><className>Abuse of Children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D4NX</classCode><className>LGBT RIGHTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922140GC</classCode><className>PRISONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00093QH</classCode><className>SEXUAL ASSAULT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc</classCode><className>Sexual Assault</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0JG</classCode><className>TRANSGENDER PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000777</classCode><className>GAYS &amp;

Its president, Craig Boyan, says it\u2019s investing in tech \u2014 but also doubling down on people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company considers people its \u201ckey differentiator,\u201d Boyan said, even as it\u2019s under price pressure from Amazon and Walmart. H-E-B has added about 40,000 employees in the past decade, raising its workforce to 116,000.</p><p>\u201cWe believe the main thing we need to do is invest in people \u2014 and better people,\u201d he said.</p><p>Boyan spoke Wednesday at a two-day conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas about technology-enabled disruption. Nearly 200 economists, policymakers, academics and business leaders are attending the conference, which looks at how technology is reshaping the economy, testing companies and demanding that students and workers learn different skills.</p><p>In his remarks, Boyan argued that companies\u2019 use of technology should be focused on creating jobs and making their customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 lives better \u2014 rather than simply squeezing out more money for shareholders.</p><p>And Boyan said he\u2019s troubled by how venture capitalists and other investors are giving huge sums of money to tech companies that are putting retailers out of business and thousands of people out of work \u2014 even though they have no viable business plan.</p><p>\u201cWe have unicorns going public that will probably never make money, wiping out jobs for your grandkids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a huge problem.\u201d</p><p>Boyan did not name any companies. Uber and Lyft, which both had recent and high-profile IPOs, are losing billions of dollars every year.</p><p>He also said economists and antitrust regulators need to rethink how to check the power of big tech companies. He called on companies to use tech in a way that values employees.</p><p>\u201cWe need to focus on investing in labor vs. dividends and [stock] buybacks,\u201d Boyan said.</p><p>As grocers add sensors, cameras and robots to their stores, they are hiring different kinds of employees \u2014 and in some cases, fewer of them. Instead of checking out customers, some employees are shopping for them so their grocery bags are ready for curbside pickup. In other cases, they\u2019re helping customers find an item or use an app that replaces a cashier.</p><p>For example, Sam\u2019s Club has an app that allows customers to check out on their own. It opened a one-of-a-kind store on Lower Greenville in November that acts as a test laboratory for new technology, such as an augmented reality app that transforms a metal shopping cart into an animated longhorn or a pirate ship to keep the youngest shoppers entertained.</p><p>Amazon has convenience stores called Amazon Go that allow customers to pick items off the shelf and walk out. Shoppers are tracked in the store through an app that\u2019s downloaded on their phones and has a stored credit card. They\u2019re automatically charged for the item, with the help of sensors and cameras. There\u2019s no need to stand in line or swipe a card. And there\u2019s no need for employees to check them out.</p><p>H-E-B has added technology to nearly every aspect of its business, Boyan said. That includes using sensors in its manufacturing plants to measure the amount of seasoning on its chips, testing robots that can pick out groceries for customers and piloting autonomous vehicles that can deliver them.</p><p>The 113-year-old grocer is a privately held company that\u2019s owned by the Butt family and its employees. It has 346 stores in Texas and 64 in Mexico and had sales of more than $25 billion last year. H-E-B\u2019s sales per store are about three times the U.S. median weekly sales of $398,000, or $20.7 million a year.</p><p>It has seven H-E-B stores that ring the southern and western sides of Dallas-Fort Worth, and six Central Markets in the Dallas area. That division of the store is based in Dallas.</p><p>H-E-B has adapted to the changing ways that customers shop. It offers online orders and curbside pickup. It has home delivery through Instacart and Favor, an Austin-based startup that H-E-B bought last year. And its warehouses also ship to the homes of \u201cmostly Tex-pats who are desperate for tortillas in Boston or wherever they live,\u201d Boyan said.</p><p>He said H-E-B is looking for ways to boost productivity, especially as more people buy their groceries online.</p><p>\u201cE-commerce is a vastly less profitable exercise than selling through the grocery store, and selling through the grocery store is not that profitable of a business either,\u201d Boyan said. \u201cSo it takes a very low-margin business and makes it a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>Boyan declined to say how much of H-E-B\u2019s sales are online. In the U.S., he said, about 3% of grocery sales are online. In the United Kingdom and in London, it\u2019s 7% and 10%, respectively, he said. In South Korea, it\u2019s about 16%, he said.</p><p>Data collection has helped the company become more sophisticated about how it stocks perishable items and sells them, Boyan said. H-E-B tracks how each customer eats and shops \u2014 and then suggestively sells items to him or her. It also uses software to better predict how much will sell so it can time the shipments of bananas, mangoes, avocados and other produce that come from about 50 countries across the world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive logistics-supply chain business, so you are seeing unbelievable innovation through the supply chain,\u201d he said.</p><p>Twitter: @melissa_repko</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DALNWS-68783763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DALNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5T-5D91-JBKB-W1XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11802</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</copyright><publicationName>THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>1 EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0001Y0N</classCode><className>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF DALLAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>BY MELISSA REPKO, STAFF WRITER, </className><className><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:MREPKO@DALLASNEWS.COM\">MREPKO@DALLASNEWS.COM</url></className><className>, CCI_EXPORT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

Our community has been uniquely vulnerable to these dangers and has been working for years to end online harassment, censorship, privacy breaches and false information.</p><p>Now that the 2016 election attacks have shaken the nation and our elected officials out of complacency, there's a growing consensus for action to protect everyone online - something that could easily be tucked into the broader net neutrality effort already underway. </p><p>For LGBT Americans, cleaning up the internet can literally be a matter of life and death. Cyberbullying and harassment of gay teens has been rampant since the first chat rooms opened more than 20 years ago, leaving a tragic epidemic of runaways and suicide in its wake. New research has found that one out of every two lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths have been victims.</p><p> Opinion label </p><p>Meanwhile, online outing and privacy invasions have become commonplace in the new surveillance state brought to us by Big Tech. And \"fake news\"spreads the most pernicious hateful myths about gay Americans as predators and health threats. </p><p>Every day seems to bring new stories about just how complete Facebook and Google's tracking, profiling, and mining of our information has become. But that's a lesson LGBT Americans have already learned, including when the gay social app Grindr was recently caught sharing users' HIV status and testing history with other companies, along with sexual orientation details, personal contact information and GPS location markers. </p><p>The Grindr breach was abhorrent and should be illegal, but so far the company has faced no repercussions. The episode may fall through the legal cracks like so many other acts of online harassment, censorship, discrimination and abuse. </p><p>Carlos Gutierrez.jpgCarlos Gutierrez</p><p>Fortunately, Congress is already actively considering internet reforms as part of the net neutrality debate. And while that effort has mostly focused on broadband providers, the new consensus on the need to regulate all companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon, creates a real chance for more comprehensive action. </p><p>LGBT Tech has joined more than 50 civil rights organizations to urge Congress to protect the internet for everyone. </p><p>Both political parties have failed to fight for real online protections in the net neutrality debate. Instead, they paid lip service to the problem with a \"Congressional Review Act\" to restore Obama-era net neutrality rules that had no chance of passing, but allowed speeches about protecting the internet.</p><p>But now that this approach no longer represents a viable path on net neutrality, we have a chance to take real action with a new bill offering comprehensive protection for the entire internet. With Americans believing by a five-to-one margin that social media isn't regulated enough, a bill that directly addresses the skyrocketing worry about the tech monopolies should have massive, bipartisan support.</p><p>It's time for Democrats and Republicans alike to end the grandstanding and responsibility ducking. Congress should make sure that both internet providers and tech giants are held accountable to net neutrality rules and to help rid the internet of its metastasizing trolls. </p><p>Carlos Gutierrez is deputy director and general counsel at LGBT Tech, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.

But the exploitation of your personal data by Cambridge Analytica is just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we've had our rude awakening to the fact our seemingly innocuous social media chitchat can be weaponized against us and our democracy, it's time to get serious and adopt the kind of strict data privacy protections taking shape in Europe. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This May, European Union officials will begin formal enforcement of the long-anticipated <url normalizedValue=\"http://General Data Protection Regulations\">General Data Protection Regulations</url>, which set strict boundaries on the way personal information is bought and sold.</p><p>Backed by the threat of multimillion-dollar fines, these data regulations give people specific rights over how their personal data is collected and shared. It provides an enviable level of transparency and requires companies to disclose what information they are gathering and why.</p><p>The regulations enacted in Brussels will affect Internet businesses worldwide. Even the giants of Silicon Valley will adopt best practices to keep from running afoul of the regulations, because no one will voluntarily abandon a developed market with a half-billion consumers.</p><p>And because no one in their right mind would walk away from California's giant economy, we are in an ideal position to demand similar commonsense privacy rights for our residents. It would be difficult for any company to argue that they can't comply with stricter rules here, since they already comply with them overseas. </p><p>We've done it before with notable success. Although auto companies may have balked initially at California's strict emissions regulations, they did figure out how to abide by them. The glaring exception to that rule, of course, was Volkswagen, but in the end it was California's air regulators who discovered the company had programmed its cars to cheat on emissions tests.</p><p>The Volkswagen case illustrates how the regulatory decisions of one state can make an impact far beyond its borders. More importantly, though, it shows that regulations are only as effective as the enforcement infrastructure behind them.</p><p>Right now, California doesn't speak with a single authoritative voice to monitor and regulate Big Tech's growing marketplace of personally identifiable data. I've introduced legislation to change that.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://AB2182\">AB2182</url> establishes the California Data Protection Authority, answerable to the Legislature and ultimately to the people of California. It will be tasked with the critical mission of protecting the personal information of California residents by holding Big Tech accountable to the law by way of reasonable regulations. The expertise developed in the data protection authority will ensure that our regulations evolve in parallel with the inevitable advancements in data collection and analysis.</p><p>AB2182 is an important step on a long journey. We have a lot of work ahead and that's why it's crucial that we get the ball rolling now. After all, replacing their long-standing privacy rules with a much more comprehensive new set took Brussels regulators more than six years.</p><p>During that time, we've learned how breathtakingly vulnerable our personal data can be. Yahoo told us not long ago that 3 billion accounts had been compromised. More than 400 million users of the adult dating site Friend Finder learned in 2016 their personal info had been hacked. The same is true of 165 million LinkedIn users and 145 million consumers whose information had been entrusted to consumer-credit reporting agency Equifax. In a surprise to many Americans who spend countless hours each day sharing with friends on Facebook, we learned how Cambridge Analytica exploited personally identifiable data from the platform to create psychographic profiles of 50 million Americans to influence the presidential election. Our surprise was the permissive complicity of Facebook, which allowed our data to be shared with Cambridge Analytica when it was expressly prohibited.</p><p>The companies we are talking about are the most profitable corporations in history. But that doesn't place them above the reach of regulators. We must tell the keepers of our data exactly what we expect them to do when they detect a breach. We must also compel them to protect intimate information about our personal lives.

Many have rightly observed that data are becoming powerful economic engines in an increasingly digitized world. Data are now a highly sought-after commodity, and many big tech companies have built their business models on monetizing data.</p><p>With artificial intelligence on the verge of becoming the next force in big data, everyone should be concerned about \"surveillance capitalism.\"</p><p>One only has to consider the future implications for financial technology, health care, autonomous vehicles and how we will build smart cities. Should we allow corporate interests to monetize personal data and dictate the rules of the game?</p><p>The implications are not just economic but also sociological and political, potentially undermining the democratic principles upon which modern societies operate. As we have seen, digital platforms can be used for nefarious purposes. The use of automated algorithms makes monitoring potential abuse even more challenging to those charged with oversight.</p><p>How we collectively decide on the rules of the game for this new data-driven economy is, I would argue, one of the most important issues facing global policy makers today. At the core of these considerations is the fundamental issue of data ownership. Who owns and controls data, for what purpose and to what end are they being employed?</p><p>As a chief executive officer of a company that made security and privacy not only a priority but a core element and value proposition of its business, I feel we have a collective responsibility to tackle this issue. At BlackBerry, our mission is to protect data, not to exploit them. It is my strong belief that every individual should own their own data. They should be yours, and yours only.</p><p>Data protection and security should be paramount. Privacy should be embedded by design in the development of products and services. There are important global governance elements to data protection. Do we need global rules regulating the trade of data? With the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has just set a new regulatory standard for customer privacy. Increasingly, regulatory frameworks based on privacy - what experts call data realms - are creating different playing fields.</p><p>We should aim at setting the bar high, abide by strong dataprotection principles and welcome responsible and balanced regulatory enforcement mechanisms that permit consumers to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies. As we move forward, national governments should reinforce existing privacy regimes with appropriate enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>In Canada, where the privacy regime is already strong under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), there might be scope to give the Privacy Commissioner more power to protect consumer data from potential abuse. The GDPR, which makes it easier for individuals not just to provide, but also to withdraw their consent from companies to use their data, should also be the new standard.</p><p>Now is the time for a robust discussion between policy makers and the tech sector about how much oversight is needed both to protect privacy and to spur innovation and competition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180519rbcochen</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC2-7FY1-JCRP-C213-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Data is now a highly sought-after commodity, and many big tech companies have built their business models on monetizing data.</p><p>With artificial intelligence on the verge of becoming the next force in big data, everyone should be concerned about what some have called surveillance capitalism.</p><p>One only has to consider the future implications for fin tech, healthcare, autonomous vehicles and how we will build smart cities. Should we allow corporate interests to monetize personal data and dictate the rules of the game?</p><p>The implications are not just economic but also sociological and political, potentially undermining the democratic principles upon which modern societies operate. As we have seen, digital platforms can be used for nefarious purposes. The use of automated algorithms makes monitoring potential abuse even more challenging to those charged with oversight.</p><p>How we collectively decide what the rules of the game for this new data-driven economy is, I would argue, one of the most important issues facing global policymakers today.</p><p>At the core of these considerations is the fundamental issue of data ownership. Who owns and controls data, for what purpose and to what end is it being employed?</p><p>As a CEO of a company that made security and privacy not only a priority but a core element and value proposition of its business, I feel we have a collective responsibility to tackle this issue.</p><p>At BlackBerry, our mission is to protect data, not to exploit it. It is my strong belief that every individual should own their own data. It should be yours, and yours only.</p><p>Data protection and security should be paramount. Privacy should be embedded by design in the development of products and services. This is what we do - and beyond - as a global company.</p><p>There are important global governance elements to data protection. Do we need global rules regulating the trade of data? With the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has just set a new regulatory standard for customer privacy. Increasingly, regulatory frameworks based on privacy - what experts call data realms - are creating different playing fields.</p><p>We should aim at setting the bar high, abide by strong data protection principles and welcome responsible and balanced regulatory enforcement mechanisms that permit consumers to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies. As we move forward, national governments should reinforce existing privacy regimes with appropriate enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>In Canada, where the privacy regime is already strong under PIPEDA, there might be scope to give the Privacy Commissioner more power to protect consumer data from potential abuse. The GDPR, which makes it easier for individuals not just to provide, but also to withdraw their consent from companies to use their data, should also be the new standard.</p><p>Now is the time for a robust discussion between policymakers and the tech sector about how much regulatory oversight is needed both to protect privacy and to spur innovation and competition. At BlackBerry, we will continue making privacy a core value of our company, our products and our services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PCQST-0040669552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PCQST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCX-12J1-DXMP-K3ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 PC Quest, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PC Quest</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001W7E</classCode><className>BLACKBERRY LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BBRY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BB (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

EU regulation on online services using copyrighted works was last updated in 1999. YouTube and other big tech platforms have been exploiting \u2018safe-harbour\u2019 loopholes in the law to use creator\u2019s content without paying them fairly.  We urgently need your help to stop that happening and to ensure musicians, creators and everyone in our world-beating music industry are not denied a fair reward for their work.  A large campaign is being launched across the industry named #LoveMusic. It is crucial that our members take part to help bring it to the attention of the public and MEPs, and ultimately get the legislation over the line in September.  What you can do to show your support:         Visit and share the #LoveMusic website <url normalizedValue=\"http://love-music.co/\">http://love-music.co/</url>, sign the petition in support of the legislation. </p><p>    Support on social media:      Follow us and UK Music on twitter and retweet as much as you can in support of the campaign using the hashtag #LoveMusic.     Post support on your own social channels using the assets you can download here.      Get artists involved by asking them to voice their support by posting on social media or any other channel they have available. Artists are key in the battle to win the hearts and minds of the public on this issue!     Send emails/letters to your parliamentarians.  We are in full in campaigning mode to get the best deal for you and your artists!

Dem \"Fintech Pulse 2019\" von KPMG zufolge schrumpfte das Investment-Volumen um knapp 4 % auf 135,7 Mrd. Dollar. Die Anzahl der Transaktionen verringerte sich sp\u00fcrbar auf 2 693 (i. V. 3 145) Deals - es fanden also vermehrt gr\u00f6\u00dfere Finanzierungsrunden statt. Vor allem zum Jahresende gab es einige Megadeals, da zunehmend Technologieriesen (Big Tech) und Finanzunternehmen Start-ups aus den Sektor akquirieren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eigene App erg\u00e4nzen</p><p>F\u00fcr eine granulare Betrachtung hat KPMG auch die Investitionen der letzten Jahre von acht Technologiekonzernen unter die Lupe genommen. Den Daten zufolge investierten Alibaba, Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft und Tencent von 2014 bis 2019 mehr als 20 Mrd. Dollar in Fintechs - davon allein 7 Mrd. in den vergangenen beiden Jahren. KPMG-Partner Bernd Oppold zufolge ist die Absicht von Big Tech offensichtlich: \"Die Technologiekonzerne sehen durch entsprechende Investments gute M\u00f6glichkeiten, eigene Aktivit\u00e4ten zu verst\u00e4rken und ihre Plattformen zu bereichern oder sich auch ganz neue Gesch\u00e4ftsfelder zu erschlie\u00dfen.\"</p><p>Auf diesen Spielfeldern wie dem Zahlungsverkehr treten sie dann in Konkurrenz zu den Banken und ziehen Erl\u00f6se aus dem Revenue Pool. Au\u00dferdem bauen sie damit direkte Endkundenbeziehungen auf, was die Rolle des Girokontos als zentralen Faktor der Bank-Kunde-Beziehung schw\u00e4cht. Payment-Kunden sind dann Teil der App-\u00d6kosysteme von Big Tech.</p><p>US-Konzerne machen es vor</p><p>KPMG geht davon aus, dass die Dealvolumina bei Fintech-M&amp;A in diesem Jahr noch weiter ansteigen werden, da Investoren noch st\u00e4rker auf Late-Stage-Fintech setzen w\u00fcrden. Das sind reifere Firmen mit fertigen Produkten und einer Marktpositionierung, die schon sichtbar Erl\u00f6se bringt und deren Einbindung in Konzernstrukturen dann eine schnelle Skalierung verspricht bzw. einen zus\u00e4tzlichen Nutzen f\u00fcr bestehende Kunden im Sinne des Upselling. So hat Visa Mitte Januar 5,3 Mrd. Dollar f\u00fcr Plaid bezahlt. Plaid ist ein API-Spezialist, der neuartige Payment-Anbieter wie Transferwise und Venmo mit klassischen Bank- oder Kreditkartenkonten verkn\u00fcpft. Als weiterer gro\u00dfer Deal d\u00fcrfte in K\u00fcrze verk\u00fcndet werden, dass der Steuer- und Finanzsoftware-Spezialist Intuit das Fintech Credit Karma f\u00fcr 7 Mrd. Dollar \u00fcbernehmen wird.</p><p>Cybersecurity zieht Geld an</p><p>Eine Entwicklung, die offenbar zuerst in den USA stattfindet. Wobei die Aktivit\u00e4t von Corporate Venture Capital in Fintech den KPMG-Daten zufolge insgesamt volatil verl\u00e4uft. Das Volumen an Cross-Border-Transaktionen ist mit gut 54 Mrd. Dollar weiter hoch. Eine rasante Entwicklung haben die Investitionen in Cybersecurity-Fintechs genommen. Der Sektor zog 646 (317) Mill. Dollar an Risikokapital an, 53 (38) Transaktionen wurden get\u00e4tigt. Die Verdoppelung der Investitionen in diesem Bereich habe unter anderem mit dem \u00dcbergang zu Open Banking in Europa und Gro\u00dfbritannien zu tun, so Oppold. Denn wo Banken ihre Daten Drittanbietern teilweise \u00f6ffnen, komme dem Schutz der Daten eine entscheidende Bedeutung zu. Das gelte umso mehr, wenn nichtregulierte Marktteilnehmer beteiligt seien. \"Angesichts der steigenden Zahl von Hackerangriffen gehen wir davon aus, dass dieses Segment auch 2020 auf nachhaltiges Interesse bei Investoren sto\u00dfen wird.\"</p><p>R\u00fcckl\u00e4ufig entwickelten sich hingegen die Insurtech-Investments, die auf 6,5 (7,5) Mrd. Dollar fielen. Gerettet wurde die Bilanz nur durch einzelne gr\u00f6\u00dfere Deals, sank die Zahl der Transaktionen doch markant von 262 auf 156. Seit dem Hoch im Jahr 2016 befinden sich die Insurtech-Investments nun im Abw\u00e4rtstrend.</p><p>Herausragende Deal-Aktivit\u00e4ten fanden im Payment-Sektor statt, wo das Volumen auf 77,8 Mrd. Dollar dank der Konsolidierung reifer Player anschwoll. M&amp;A habe nicht nur im Endkundensegment, sondern auch im B2B-Sektor stattgefunden. Dabei ragten zwei Deals aus dem Bereich Zahlungsverkehr heraus: die Akquisition von Worldpay durch Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) mit 42,5 Mrd. Dollar und die 22 Mrd. Dollar schwere \u00dcbernahme von First Data durch Fiserv.</p><p>Regtech ein stiller Riese</p><p>Im Fahrwasser des Trendthemas Cybersicherheit nimmt auch die Deal-Aktivit\u00e4t in Regtech zu, wenn auch bei stark schwankenden Volumina. Mit steigender Komplexit\u00e4t der regulatorischen Landschaft erh\u00f6he sich auch das Interesse an automatisierten Prozessen in Compliance und Risikomanagement, so KPMG. Zudem m\u00fcssen die Aufseher selbst aufr\u00fcsten, um den gestiegenen Erfordernissen beim Datenmanagement gerecht zu werden.</p><p>Im Bereich Wealthtech ist zu beobachten, dass die Euphorie raus ist aus dem Segment. Nachdem 2015 und 2018 f\u00fcr die Personal-Finance-Fintechs Blockbuster-Jahre waren, wurden 2019 lediglich Gelder in H\u00f6he von 474 Mill. Dollar angezogen. Der Grund daf\u00fcr ist einfach: Banken und Assetmanager haben das Thema f\u00fcr sich entdeckt und investieren selbst in diese F\u00e4higkeiten, mehr als Partnerschaften sind da nicht drin f\u00fcr die Fintechs. Zudem hat sich im Robo-Advisor-Markt gezeigt, wie schwer sich die digitalen Selbstentscheider damit tun, ihr Geld \u00fcber neue Marken anzulegen. Trotzdem d\u00fcrfte es noch zu Akquisitionen im Wealthtech-Sektor kommen.</p><p>US-Fintechs heimsten insgesamt 59,8 Mrd. Dollar an Finanzierungen ein, ein leichtes Plus gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr - wobei das Volumen hier durch die First-Data-Transaktion aufgebl\u00e4ht wurde. Das provoziert implizit die Frage, ob die Abgrenzung des Begriffes \"Fintech\" nicht vielleicht ein wenig breit gefasst ist: Eigentlich gilt als Fintech nur, wer nicht \u00e4lter ist als zehn Jahre. Im Bereich Payment kann man da gro\u00dfz\u00fcgiger abgrenzen, fand hier die Disruption \u00fcber Ur-Fintechs wie Paypal doch sehr fr\u00fch statt.</p><p>F\u00fcr Europa wird ein Investment-Volumen von 58,1 Mrd. Dollar verteilt \u00fcber 753 Deals festgestellt. Auff\u00e4llig ist der Anstieg der Runden \u00fcber 100 Mill. Dollar wie bei N26 und Klarna sowie die starke Rolle von Corporate VC: Im Fokus stehen reife Fintechs, die mit frischem Geld skalieren sollen - die europ\u00e4ischen Banken und Versicherer \u00f6ffnen offenbar zunehmend ihre Schatullen f\u00fcr VC-Investments. Entgegen so mancher Erwartung konnte Gro\u00dfbritannien mit 48,5 (37,4) Mrd. Dollar sogar deutlich mehr Fintech-Volumen anziehen.</p><p>2020 wird f\u00fcr viele Fintech-Finanzierungen dennoch herausfordernder, d\u00fcrften Investoren hohe Bewertungen nach dem Debakel des geplatzten Wework-IPO doch kritischer unter die Lupe nehmen - in gewissem Sinne ist diese Tech-Blase geplatzt. Experten erwarten allgemein, dass 2020 ein frostiges Fintech-Jahr wird.</p><p>----</p><p>- Wertberichtigt Seite 6</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"68504701\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2020038010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2020038010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y91-5031-JBJ9-H1WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

They\u2019re slightly freaked out and hoping for tips to shore up their digital hygiene or for a guide that might help them navigate the internet without giving away their personal data. For months I\u2019ve included a Tip of the Week feature for this very reason, but I\u2019ve always felt conflicted about it, because the hard truth is that our data is leaking and trading all the time, in places we might not even know to look. Each privacy tip you follow is undoubtedly helpful (and you should follow them!), but it\u2019s a bit like a single sandbag in a hurricane: You need to amass so, so many and be extremely vigilant to make a difference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">argued previously</url> that the personal-responsibility frame for privacy is unfair. And I believe that the only way to fully transform privacy is if data protection moves from individuals to institutions. But that said, I was moved over the holiday weekend by an argument that gave me a bit of hope that there are small ways we individuals can make a difference.</p><p>The idea came from the writer Dave Eggers. In an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">interview with Vox\u2019s</url> Ezra Klein, Eggers \u2014 who doesn\u2019t have Wi-Fi in his home and still uses a flip phone \u2014 makes the argument that our public demand for more and more information plays a meaningful role in the privacy discussion:</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just blame the Big Five [Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon] and the surveillance they do and the N.S.A., because we are constantly using these tools on each other and thinking it\u2019s O.K. Whether it\u2019s getting email receipts, whether it\u2019s parents surveilling their kids, even at college. Whether it\u2019s spouses surveilling each other through their smartphones \u2014 all the spying people do on each other. People surreptitiously taking photos of each other because it\u2019s so easy now and you always have a high-level camera in your hands. I think that we don\u2019t necessarily realize how quickly we\u2019ve evolved and how quickly we have superseded our idea of our right to privacy by our right to know. </p><p> He continues:</p><p>We\u2019ve evolved to the point where our ideas of privacy have evolved or our value of it is almost completely gone. I think there\u2019s a few square feet and our skulls that we still retain. There\u2019s the bathroom, the bedroom after a certain hour and there\u2019s the space in our brain. But nowhere else do we expect privacy. And I think that\u2019s a radical shift in evolution, and it happened in a few years. </p><p>There are bits in the larger conversation that I disagree with Eggers on, mostly because I think it offers too much cover for Big Tech. I think his argument that there\u2019s a \u201cpublic market\u201d for privacy-invading services and that tech companies are merely responding to it and building products is a backward interpretation. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s human behavior that\u2019s responding to powerful, addictive products and well-crafted marketing campaigns. Regardless, I think there\u2019s something poignant about this line: \u201cWe have superseded our idea of our right to privacy by our right to know.\u201d</p><p>Writing about technology for roughly a decade, I\u2019ve felt this strongly at times. I noticed it first watching Reddit threads after a mass shooting in 2012 inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. \u2014 a kind of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">online vigilante detective emerged</url>, powered by the idea that almost any piece of information could be found and that, by virtue of being online, we were entitled to it. Since then, the behavior has embedded itself into the dark soul of the internet. The hunt for the Boston bombers, Gamergate, the 4chan culture of doxing \u2014 some of it is predicated on a behavior to want information that, 15 years ago, we might not have felt entitled to.</p><p>These are extreme examples, of course. But there are countless, mundane ways in which we use technology to demand information from one another, as Eggers points out. We track emails and snap pictures of unknowing individuals in public. Even a small act like sending a late-night work email that could wait until morning is an invasion of our private time. We rarely think about it that way because it\u2019s so easy to fire off a quick message and we\u2019re so eager for an immediate response \u2014 for more information. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t value privacy (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">we care about it more than we think</url>); it\u2019s that we no longer expect it for ourselves or for others.</p><p>Which brings us back to that quest for solutions. Without a comprehensive privacy bill or some meaningful regulation of Big Tech, we\u2019re not going to change the way our data is siphoned away. But we can hope to change what we demand from ourselves and others when it comes to those small, everyday privacy invasions. We can be more respectful of others\u2019 desires to unplug by giving them space to do so. We can give space to friends and family by not monitoring them just because we can. We can make small choices not to demand information solely because we feel entitled to it. Perhaps most important, we can give ourselves both the space to disconnect and the permission to say \u201cno\u201d when others demand more information from us (from read receipts to social network prompts). </p><p>This might feel like a marginal change, but shifting our expectations can have a profound impact on ourselves and others. Nothing about technological <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">change is inevitable</url>. As my Opinion colleague Annalee Newitz wrote last week, \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">a better internet is waiting for us.</url>\u201d That we\u2019ll eventually find it isn\u2019t certain. And the process will be extremely difficult, but it will start with us reimagining what we expect of one another.</p><p>What Google Knew:</p><p>If you like this newsletter, I suggest you <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">also subscribe to Big,</url> a newsletter by Open Markets\u2019 Matt Stoller. It\u2019s about monopoly power and frequently gets into fascinating issues about Big Tech and privacy. Last week, Stoller had a fascinating tidbit from the Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar about how Google\u2019s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, predicted the disruption that Google would cause to the advertising ecosystem. Here\u2019s what she told Stoller:</p><p>The most surprising thing I leaned while researching the book was that the founders of Google, Sergei and Larry, had basically predicted the key problems with surveillance capitalism and where they would lead us back in their original paper on search, written while they were Stanford grad students. At the very end, in the appendix, there\u2019s a paragraph where they admit that the targeted advertising business model could be misused by companies or other entities in ways that would hurt users. This is kind of a bombshell revelation given that search engines say everything they do is for users. The fact that this paper hasn\u2019t gotten more attention makes me think people aren\u2019t reading.</p><p>I decided to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">look up the paper</url>, which has the sexy headline, \u201cThe Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine.\u201d Foroohar is right \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating reading from a 2019 perspective where Google has a near-monopoly on search:</p><p>The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. \u2026 We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased toward the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.</p><p>Then, Page and Brin raise the issue of search engine bias. \u201cSince it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious,\u201d they write. It continues, with an example from the defunct search engine, OpenText. \u201cThis type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who \u2018deserves\u2019 to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed.\u201d</p><p>Page and Brin most likely included this because they believed that their search engine would be an exception to the rule. But the conclusion reads as somewhat prophetic:</p><p>In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">whole paper is worth your time</url>, but you can read the entirety of what I quoted from by scrolling down to Appendix A.</p><p>What I\u2019m Reading:</p><p>\u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">Activists Build a Grass-Roots Alliance Against Amazon</url>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">Ring Doesn\u2019t Have Facial Recognition \u2014 Some Police Want to Add Their Own</url>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">Top Senate Democrats Unveil New Online Privacy Bill, Promising Tough Penalties for Data Abuse</url>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/alabama-app-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcharlie-warzel\">They See You When You\u2019re Shopping</url>\u201d</p><p>Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the committee to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies' private correspondences.  The release includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses.  The CEOs of Amazon , Apple , Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet were careful not to say too much as they were grilled by lawmakers on the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust last Wednesday. But internal documents released by the committee after the hearing say plenty.   The release is a curated selection of the 1.3 million documents collected by the committee during its more than year-long investigation into competition concerns with the four tech giants. It includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire. It shows industry leaders strategizing ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses, like Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram or Amazon's decision to undercut prices for diapers to compete with Diapers.com.   The four companies turned over the documents at the request of the committee. But the huge trove of evidence is likely just a fraction of that which federal and state regulators have been poring over as they decide whether to bring an antitrust case against any of the tech giants. Google appears to be most immediately in danger of such an outcome as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the Justice Department is gearing up to announce an antitrust case as soon as this summer.   In some cases, regulators may have had these documents before, like when requesting more information on a potential deal. Alicia Batts, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Squire Patton Boggs, said it's not uncommon for \"bad documents\" to surface in a merger investigation.   \"It's an indication to look deeper but not necessarily an indication you won't be able to close [the deal],\" she said in an interview this week with CNBC. \"When you have both documents that show a company is planning to harm competition and the economic data or the economic model support that it's possible, that's when the documents are given the most weight.\"   CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the House Judiciary Committee last week to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies' private correspondences.    Here are the most notable finds and what they could mean for a potential antitrust case against each company.  Facebook  What an antitrust case could look like: Experts speculate that an antitrust case against Facebook would center largely around its acquisition strategy and whether it broke merger laws by buying up a nascent competitor or violated anti-monopoly law by taking anti-competitive actions to build or maintain dominance in its market.   Most interesting finds: The most compelling documents released by the committee on Facebook reveal top executives' thinking behind its acquisition of Instagram, one of the two deals that are now thought to have played a key role in Facebook's continued growth, along with its acquisition of WhatsApp. Some enforcement advocates, like Columbia Law Professor Tim Wu , believe that had those apps not been acquired at an early stage, they could have grown into formidable competitors against Facebook.   -  Executives fretted about Facebook's relatively weak offerings on mobile, where Instagram had built its growing userbase.    \"We have this big issue right now because gaming is shifting from us to mobile platforms,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one April 2012 email. \"It's causing all this negative momentum in a bunch of ways around gamer overall user engagement, ad spend from gamers, overall revenue, etc.\"    -  Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat posed by Instagram in conversations with his deputies. In February 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an email to his then-CFO David Ebersman he was considering how much Facebook should be \"willing to pay to acquire mobile app companies like Instagram and Path that are building networks that are competitive with our own.\" He said that while those competitors have small teams, they have shown fast growth and even if they don't want to sell, a high enough price may change their minds.    \"The businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\" Zuckerberg wrote.    In April 2012, he told one employee in an email, \"Instagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business though. For the others, if they become big we'll just regret not doing them.\"    - As Zuckerberg began to court Instagram for a potential deal, Systrom messaged one of his investors, Benchmark Partner Matt Cohler, in February 2012 for advice on how to politely rebuff an offer. Systrom seemed adamant in wanting to stay independent to see how far he could take Instagram on his own. But he wanted Cohler's advice on whether Zuckerberg would \"go into destroy mode\" if he rejected an offer.    \"[P]robably,\" Cohler responded, \"(and probably if we just don't engage at all).\"   As they strategized the best response, Systrom acknowledged, \"bottom line I don't think we'll ever escape the wrath of mark haha\"   Later on, messages between Systrom and Zuckerberg leading up to their agreement to merge shed light on what Instagram had to fear if they were to go it alone.   \"Of course, at the same time we're developing our own photos strategy,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"so how we engage now will also determine how much we're partners vs competitors down the line.\"   What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Even if regulators believe Facebook executives were afraid of the potential rise of Instagram and WhatsApp, it may not be enough to accuse them of violating merger law. To prove that Facebook violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act through those acquisitions, the FTC may have to prove not only that Instagram and WhatsApp were capable of growing into competitors to Facebook on their own, but also that they were one of the very few firms that were committed to getting into Facebook's market and capable of doing so.   \"What that means is, if at the time of the acquisition it looks as if Instagram was just one of many nascent folks nibbling at the heels of Facebook, the case law makes it very hard for the government to block that kind of an acquisition,\" said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly led the FTC's Bureau of Competition and DOJ Antitrust Division during Democratic administrations.   A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the company had submitted the documents included in the Judiciary Committee file in its disclosure to the FTC in 2012 when the agency reviewed Facebook's proposed acquisition of Instagram. That indicates the FTC determined at the time that those statements did not preclude the merger when weighed against economic models predicting the companies' future success.   But looking back is often easier than looking forward. Showing a pattern of anti-competitive acquisitions or other behavior could potentially help build a case against Facebook under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the anti-monopoly law, or Section 5 of the FTC Act , which grants what some believe to be broader power to the regulator.   Section 5 empowers the FTC to prevent companies from engaging in \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\"   \"When you're talking about Section 5, it's not just [the] Sherman and Clayton Act, but it's kind of the spirit of the antitrust laws,\" said Batts, the Squire Patton Boggs partner.   This could also be an issue the House Judiciary Committee tackles with its legislative proposals expected to follow the conclusion of its probe. Lawmakers may determine the bar is too high to decide a deal is anti-competitive and adjust the language to make it easier for authorities to bring a case on such grounds.    Facebook did not provide a comment on the documents.  Amazon  What an antitrust case could look like: An antitrust case for Amazon may resemble the line of thinking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered in her presidential campaign platform  on breaking up Big Tech. Warren argued large tech companies designated as \"Platform Utilities\" should not be able to control and participate on their own platforms. The FTC has been talking to third-party sellers on Amazon's platform, according to Bloomberg , following concerns that Amazon undercuts sellers on its marketplace.   A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that Amazon employees had used internal data to inform their private-label brand strategy and compete with other sellers. Though the employees reportedly used aggregated reports combining multiple sellers' performance, they sometimes contained as few as two sellers, making it easy to extrapolate a single seller's data. Amazon has said it was launching an internal investigation into the allegations by the Journal, but said it didn't believe the claims to be true.   Most Interesting finds:  Amazon's internal emails mostly shed light on the company's acquisition mindset and pricing strategy to compete with Diapers.com before it acquired its parents company.   -  A top executive, then-vice president of worldwide corporate development Douglas Booms, identified Diapers.com as Amazon's \"#1 short term competitor\" in a 2009 email. \"As I've mentioned to each of you, I think, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\" Booms wrote.   Over the next year, Amazon began operating its diaper business at a loss, a profit and loss statement shows , offset by other segments of the baby business.    Once executives learned Diapers.com's parent company, Quidsi, was planning to launch a new vertical, Soap.com, executives crafted a plan to keep it at bay.   \"We have already initiated a more aggressive 'plan to win' against diapers.com in the diaper/baby space, which includes market leading pricing on diapers (\"double your SNS discount to 30% off diapers and wipes\"), a free PRIME offering for new Moms, and a structured and marketed 'Amazon Mom\" program,'\" said Doug Herrington, then-VP of consumables at Amazon. \"To the extent this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of soap.com.\"   Amazon announced in 2010 its move to buy Quidsi in a reported $545 million deal , only to shut down the business in 2017 after Amazon said it failed to become profitable.   -  CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged in an email to executives in 2017 that he wanted  to buy doorbell security camera system Ring to solidify market position.    \"To be clear, my view here is that we're buying market position - not technology,\" Bezos wrote. \"And that market position and momentum is very valuable.\"    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Regulators could use the Diapers.com documents to argue that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. But doing so is not as easy as showing it discounted goods below its costs, which is a standard competitive practice in some cases and could be considered beneficial for consumers if it results in sustained lower prices.   The FTC says on its website that while prices can at times be \"too low,\" this doesn't happen often.   \"Consumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time,\" the agency says. \"A firm's independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.\"   Baer, the former federal antitrust enforcer, said laws prohibiting predatory pricing are not meant to discourage price competition. But discounting could lend way to anti-competitive practices when a firm later has the ability to raise prices after eliminating its rival.     \"If you are pricing below an appropriate measure of your cost for the purpose of injuring a competitor and you have the ability to recoup those losses once your competitor is out of business or retreats from its discounting practices, that is potentially an antitrust violation,\" Baer said.   Still, the documents released by the committee so far don't shed much light on what could become the true focus of an antitrust investigation: how Amazon competes with sellers on its platform. That doesn't mean those documents don't exist, though, or that regulators aren't learning more about those relationships in their interviews with competitors and insiders.   Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.  Apple   What an antitrust case could look like: The antitrust theory against Apple centers on its control of the App Store. While iPhones are prevalent throughout the U.S., Apple only ranks third in worldwide market share for smartphones at 13.3%, according to IDC , while the market leader Samsung holds a 21.2% share.   A potential case against Apple could look similar to one against Amazon, focusing on the fact that it both owns a marketplace (the App Store) and has its own pre-loaded apps like Apple Music and Apple Podcasts that compete with other apps on its platform, like Spotify .   Some developers who offer their apps through the App Store \u2014 the only way Apple allows for apps to be added to users' devices \u2014 have complained about Apple's opaque and sometimes seemingly arbitrary process for accepting new apps.   Most recently, the founders of Basecamp complained that Apple unfairly rejected their new email app , Hey. Apple had originally claimed it did not meet standards in an early version because it did not offer a way for users to make an account through the app, which would require the developers to give Apple a 30% cut of iOS sign-ups in the first year. An updated version of the app was later approved.   Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of what it's dubbed the \"Apple Tax,\" the 15% to 30% cut Apple takes for payments processed through apps offered on the App Store. Apple claims the commission covers the cost of running the App Store, but developers have complained that the cost can be prohibitively high and Apple does not provide alternative payment methods. The European Commission recently announced two antitrust probes into Apple's App Store and Apple Pay.   Most Interesting finds: The documents released paint a picture that Apple's rules around its App Store may not be as rigid as the company has repeatedly insisted they are.   Faced with criticism over its opaque enforcement of App Store rules, Apple has publicly stated that it approaches enforcement consistently.    \"We apply the rules to all developers evenly,\" CEO Tim Cook testified at the antitrust subcommittee hearing last week.    But internal emails released by the Judiciary Committee show that Apple has at times loosened its rules for some developers. In 2016, for example, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in an email that Apple had agreed to taking only a 15% cut of revenue for customers who sign up for Amazon Prime Video in their iOS app and no cut for already-subscribed customers.    Although it's unclear from the emails what terms the companies ended up acting on, Cue's promise is different from what Apple typically says it charges developers: a 30% cut of in-app purchase revenue in the first year and 15% every year after for recurring subscriptions.   -  Several emails included in the release revolve around developers and customers complaining about Apple's enforcement of rules for parental control apps. Apple cracked down on several such apps last year, as The New York Times reported, coinciding with the announcement of Apple's own feature to track screen time. Apple said at the time the removal of the apps was based on the discovery that they could gain too much access to information on users' devices and it was unrelated to the screen time feature launch. In an email responding to a concerned user, Apple's App Store boss Phil Schiller said the technology used to control devices \"is not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumers' data and devices, but the apps we removed from the store did just that.\"   Back in 2018, then- T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert emailed Schiller complaining about its FamilyMode app being removed from the App Store after back and forth with Apple about getting it into compliance. Schiller ended up offering to reinstate the app on the platform for two weeks while T-Mobile worked to remedy the alleged violations.   Apple later loosened its restrictions on parental control apps, causing further frustration for some. One developer complained to Apple executives they had spent $30,000 to retool their parental control app with the guidance of Apple employees only to later find the rule was changed, presumably in such a way that it would not have had to make that investment. Responses from Apple executives to the developer were not included in the documents released.   - In a couple emails, Apple executives seemed unclear on the company's rules or at least acknowledged the ambiguity around its policies.   Emails between PR executives in 2019 showed those tasked with communicating Apple's views on right to repair legislation were unclear on the company's stance. The proposals aimed to make it easier for consumers and third-parties to find and offer repair services outside of the manufacturer.   \"Right now, it's pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy,\" then-director of corporate communications Lori Lodes wrote in a 2019 email. \"Plus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position.\"   In another instance, then-senior product manager for AR and VR Cameron Rogers told Schiller in a 2019 email that it was unclear to him and others within Apple why a particular gaming app was not included on the App Store.   \"It still isn't obvious to people inside the company that work directly on the App Store. I think few people understand the subtleties of the rules as well as you do,\" Rogers wrote.   - Top PR officials at Apple sought to separate their brand from Google's as they discussed how best to respond to Warren's platform of breaking up Big Tech.   Apple's former VP of Communications Steve Dowling wrote to his team last year that arguments against Warren's platform should seek to show Apple is not a monopolist \"that's shown by market share\" and emphasize, \"How do we handle competition with our own apps? We don't do things like pushing down results, etc., as Google (one of her real targets) has.\" The charge seems to refer to allegations that Google prioritizes its own features in search results or stacks ads at the top of the page. Google has denied unfairly disadvantaging websites in its search product.   What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Regulators could seek to prove that Apple applies its App Store rules disproportionately to disadvantage rivals. However, they'd likely need to make a credible case that Apple's decisions are fueled at least in part by an attempt to preference its own services, rather than consumer protection issues it claims to champion. Still, if regulators can show Apple inconsistently applied its rules across developers and made better terms for some for its own business reasons, it could face serious scrutiny.   Apple did not provide a comment on the emails.  Google  What an antitrust case could look like: Google's sprawling business has attracted antitrust scrutiny on multiple fronts. Regulators have looked into Google's search business, online advertising platform and Android mobile operating system. Here's what they might be looking for in each:     Vertical search competitors like Yelp and TripAdvisor , which offer search engines for specific purposes like local businesses or travel, have complained for years that Google prioritizes its own services over their own, like by offering its own competing services above theirs in relevant Google search results. The FTC has investigated Google's search practices in the past and in 2013, its commissioners unanimously voted to close the investigation even though staff had recommended bringing a case, according to a report later obtained by the Journal .   Google's advertising business has attracted scrutiny over a variety of concerns that essentially boil down to the question of whether Google's expansive control over the digital media supply chain allows other companies to compete. While Google has competitors across many functions of the advertising marketplace, it operates in both the buy-side and sell-side of transactions, leading to some questions about whether it remains objective about where it routes advertising dollars. Competitors also argue that Google's prices are hard to match because it bundles its ad tools. And on YouTube, Google eliminated the ability to buy ads through third-party services, funneling all spend through its own tools.   Finally, with its Android mobile operating system, Google requires device manufacturers who use its platform to pre-install its app store and other native apps like Gmail and its Chrome web browser. The European Commission required Google to stop bundling its apps on Android phones and allow allow EU users to select their default search engine after fining the company $5 billion over alleged antitrust abuse.   Most Interesting finds: The internal emails released show how Google executives considered the ways they could position various aspects of the business to become most integral to their users' lives.   - The documents show Google's fixation on being the leader in search. In a report about how the company would stay ahead in search in 2007, Google said it should \"Turn having the largest user base into an unfair advantage by building out tech that improves linearly with user base size.\"    The report recognized MySpace \"as the clear leader\" in people search and social networking at the time. It noted that sites like MySpace and YouTube \"will ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there. They aren't direct competitors, but they may displace us in end-user time tradeoff.\"   \"In the future, we do not want users [to] 'myspace' people for more information. Google should host all information about a person, including myspace info,\" the report later states.   In 2012, executives discussed their strategy around vertical search, where competitors like Yelp and Booking.com had taken hold. Jeff Huber, a senior vice president who led location services and commerce at the time, explained in an email why he believed it was important to have a presence in verticals like travel and shopping.   \"[I]f we don't have experiences in these areas that are compelling compared to increasingly concentrated branded alternatives, we risk losing relevance overall (e.g., Amazon is increasingly becoming the place you search for things and Google is the place you search for information).\"   Still, then-SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace warned, \"I don't think we want to fight amazon on their turf by building and branding a single purpose experience by a separate team. The same goes for Yelp and Local.\" Instead, he advocated for an interface that works across several verticals.   - As Google executives pondered whether to buy YouTube, one key consideration appeared to be thwarting Yahoo from snatching up the video service.   Huber, the SVP of geo and commerce at the time, wrote in a 2005 email, \"I think we should talk to them, if nothing else to make it more expensive for Yahoo. They'll also eventually need a monetization/ads model, so we should use ours instead of anything from Yahoo (if they don't go acquisition soon, and we maintain reasonable relations with them).\"   Still, then-Group Product Manager Peter Chane wrote that there would be plenty of other acquisition targets for Yahoo to aim for.    \"[I]f we pick them up it would be defensive vs yahoo but there are 20 more sites like this that yahoo could go and buy,\" he wrote at the time.   Google ended up buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.   What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Like the documents released for the other companies, it is hard to point to any email as a smoking gun. But if regulators were to build an antitrust case against Google, documents like these could be used to show patterns in Google's competitive strategy, like buying a company to prevent a rival from doing it first or building and prioritizing native tools on its search engine platform to keep users from clicking away to competitors' websites.   Google did not provide a comment on the emails, but a spokesperson downplayed the company's dominance in search, saying Amazon gets more searches for consumer products than Google does, for example.   -CNBC's Jessica Bursztynsky ,  Michelle Gao  and  J.R.

Monopolies whose black box algorithms are all-powerful but completely opaque to public scrutiny?</p><p>    Call it whatever you want, but it certainly isn't Capitalism, which requires competition and market transparency to price capital, labor, risk, credit, goods, services, etc.  Black Box Monopolyis the death of Capitalism as it eliminates competition and market transparency.  Legalized Fraud  The American economy is now dominated by Big TechBlack Box Monopolies, and thus what we have isn't a 'free market' system (a.k.a. capitalism), it's thepretense of capitalism, a slick PR cover for the most rapacious form of exploitation.  The SillyCon Valley model is simple: achieve monopoly power by scaling the network effect and buying up hundreds of potential competitors with stock 'printed' out of thin air.  Once monopoly is achieved, buyers and sellers are both captive to the Big Tech monopoly: both buyers and sellers of apps, for example, must submit to the profiteering and control of the Big Tech monopoly.  Once the profits flowing from monopoly pile up, buy back the shares you 'printed' to eliminate competition, boosting the wealth of insiders to the moon. Since share buybacks were once illegal, this is nothing butlegalized fraud.  Despite the immense destruction these Big Tech monopolies wreak on society, the political power they purchase protects them from any limits. of 'free markets.'That their platforms now control the flow of data, including political content and adverts, is brushed aside with the usual paradoxical claims  Ironic, isn't it?  Too Big to Fail  Big TechBlack Box Monopoliesclaim they shouldn't be exposed to any regulation because they've destroyed competition and transparency within the letter of the law.  Monopoly platforms that control the flow of data, news and narratives are privatized totalitarianism, cloaked by the pretense of capitalism.  Like all totalitarian monopolies, Big Tech now claims 'you can't limit us because now you depend on us.' In other words, Big Tech is now too centralized and powerful to submit to any socio-political controls.  It's a neat trick. Enrich the super-wealthy 'investor class' with your buyback-juiced stock valuations, 'buying' their loyalty and political pull with these outsized gains to keep your monopoly out of reach of any public scrutiny or limits on your profiteering and privatized totalitarianism.  That our society and economy are now in thrall to privatized totalitarian Big Tech monopolies is straight out of a science fiction book in which what's perceived as real has been manipulated by those who own the means of manipulation.  Serfs on Big Tech's Platform Plantations  We're not just debt-serfs in central-bank feudalism, we're all serfs on Big Tech's platform plantations.  If you don't love your servitude with sufficient enthusiasm, Big Tech has a special place for you: the Village of the Deplatformed, a village of ghosts who have disappeared from the platform plantations and who no longer show up in search, social media, app stores, etc.  Just as the Soviets snipped those sent to the gulag out of photos, the privatized, totalitarian Big Tech monopolies cut out your selfhood and your income.  Deplatformed doesn't just mean you disappear from view, it also means you've beendemonetized\u2014 your ability to earn money from your own content has been eliminated.  In effect, your labor, content and selfhood have been expropriated by Big Tech's totalitarian platforms.  Big Tech monopolies don't just 'own' the plantation of the mind, they own the platform plantations that control what we see, buy and sell, and what the algorithms collect and sell to everyone who wants to influence what we see, buy and sell.  All those who believe the privatized totalitarianism of Big Tech platform plantations are 'capitalism' have been brainwashed into servitude by Big Tech's pretense of capitalism. Just because totalitarianism and fraud are now 'legal' doesn't mean they're not evil.  It's no secret that many of these big tech companies loathe Trump and want to see him lose the election.  But since the big tech companies are basically driving the stock market these days, the ironic thing is that their continued success could help hand Trump the election.  Which brings me to the 'Deep State'  Will the Deep State Kill the Market Rally to Nix Trump's Election Chances?  Back in June I speculated that the only way the Deep State could deep-six Trump's re-election was to sink the stock market rally, which the president has long touted as evidence of his economic leadership.  Since then, stocks have lofted ever higher, with the Nasdaq index hitting new all-time highs and the S&amp;#38;P 500 passing its pre-pandemic heights of euphoria.  So far, there's nothing to support my thesis other than the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which has declined modestly over the past 11 weeks, from $7.165 trillion on 6/3/20 to $6.957 trillion on 8/12/20, more or less idling in neutral.  This same neutral stance set up the late-February crash.  The context here is the Deep State is far from monolithic. Rather, it has fractured into warring camps that reflect the nation's profound political disunity.  Historian Michael Grant identified profound political disunity in the ruling elites as a key cause of the dissolution of the Roman Empire.  Grant described this dynamic in his excellent accountThe Fall of the Roman Empire.The chapter titles of the book illuminate the mutually reinforcing dynamics of profound political disunity in the ruling elites  Check, Check, Check  The Gulfs Between the Classes: a.k.a. soaring income/wealth inequality: check.  The Credibility Gap: The Mainstream Media and the Big Tech platforms laud their monopoly powers and the self-serving, failing elite they serve: check.  The Partnerships That Failed: the SillyCon Valley tech titans were supposed to 'save' the neoliberal elite by managing social media the way the MSM managed broadcast propaganda/'news': check.  The Undermining of Effort: if I don't get my way, I'll block yours. There is no common ground left. Only pseudo-reforms are possible, as the bureaucratic thicket is impenetrable.  Is there any doubt about the profound political disunity in America's ruling elite?  The globalist, neoliberal, neoconservative consensus in the Ruling Elite has splintered, reflecting the splintering of the Deep State, the unelected government that continues on regardless of which party or elected politico is currently in office.  The Imperial Project is being challenged and perhaps even sabotaged by a Deep State camp fearful of Imperial Over-Reach.  Recognizing the over-reach, this camp understands that the Imperial Project's expansion will lead to collapse, and to save the core assets, the Imperial pretensions have to be jettisoned.  This is far from the only fracture in the Deep State, of course. The best description of the Deep State's disunity may well be Byzantine.  The Fed's Job Is to Maintain Dollar Hegemony  In the larger Imperial scheme, the Federal Reserve's only job is to maintain U.S. dollar hegemony. In terms of the Imperial Project, the Fed's constant goosing of the stock market is only useful to the degree it serves dollar hegemony.  But the Imperial Project has survived financial crises and downturns; the stock market is only one of many signaling mechanisms of interest, but it isn't the end all to be all. The Fed serves the Imperial Project, not the other way around.  The Deep State camps, seeking to grease the skids of Trump's defeat, have zero interest in defending Bezos' billions, or anyone else's billions. To the degree that a stock market crash discombobulates the warring factions, it can be viewed as an excellent opportunity to slip a blade between the ribs of weakening rivals.  The benefits of a stock market crash that tarnishes Trump's financial luster would be of unique value to these Deep State camps. The Fed whining about the need to prop up the economy via the stock market's melt-up is an annoyance that these camps can no longer tolerate.  Do-or-Die Time for the Deep State  With only about 50 trading days and just over 70 calendar days to the election, the Deep State camps seeking to torpedo Trump's re-election have reached the do-or-die point:  Either reverse the stock market melt-up and begin a crash into late October, or hand Trump the potentially decisive narrative of a V-shaped recovery and a stock market relentlessly notching new highs.  Who knows, there may even be a few disaffected Deep Staters who want to see Bezos, Zuckerberg et al. go down as much as the rest of America.  All of which is to say: the next 11 weeks might become, well,interesting.

The company, which is dropping the word \"bank\" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge \u2013 including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker \u2013 ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.    Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \"SmartMarket,\" an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play.    \"It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,\" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.    The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.    In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \"largest transformation\" in its history.    \"We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking license,\" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.    Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modeled on product launches by global technology firms.    New gadgets: Meet Salute    Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.    Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon's Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps.    What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \"cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\" Sberbank said.    The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.    \"It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\" said Rafalovsky.    Tech's a risky business    The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.    Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.    Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft's LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.    However, Sberbank's costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.    Apple, Samsung and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru, internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market.    In June, Sberbank and Yandex \u2013 known as Russia's answer to Google \u2013 said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.    Life beyond banking    While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.    BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.    Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.    \"How do you earn money if you do banking business only?\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43151846306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-V8V1-JCSC-J1C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Daily Sabah</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000D8PQ</classCode><className>SBERBANK ROSSII OAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

The company, which is dropping the word \"bank\" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday (Sep 24). Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \"SmartMarket\", an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play. \"It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,\" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. </p><p>He declined to disclose the specific amount. The Russian government owns a stake of 50 per cent plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of US$401 billion as of August and a market value of about US$67 billion. In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \"largest transformation\" in its history. \"We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products. Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms. NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition. Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon's Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps. What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \"cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\" Sberbank said. The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money. \"It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\" said Rafalovsky. TECH'S A RISKY BUSINESS The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date. Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country. Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft's LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks. However Sberbank's costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market. Apple , Samsung and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru , internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market. In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia's answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition. LIFE BEYOND BANKING While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25 per cent, while rates are negative in some of their European markets. BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire. Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said. \"How do you earn money if you do banking business only?\" she added. - Reuters/kv</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-13141998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X8-5X41-DYWP-R1Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><timeReceived>8:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The company, which is dropping the word \u201cbank\u201d from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.   Sberbank\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \u201cSmartMarket\u201d, an equivalent to Apple\u2019s AppStore or Google Play.   \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it\u2019s a huge investment,\u201d he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.   The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country\u2019s oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.   In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia\u2019s digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \u201clargest transformation\u201d in its history.   \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\u201d Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.   Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.  Slideshow ( 4 images ) NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE  Among Sberbank\u2019s new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.   Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple\u2019s Siri, Hey Google or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank\u2019s devices and mobile apps.   What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \u201ccultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\u201d Sberbank said.   The company\u2019s SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.   \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\u201d said Rafalovsky.  TECH\u2019S A RISKY BUSINESS  The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.   Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.   Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.   However Sberbank\u2019s costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.   Apple AAPL.O , Samsung 005930.KS and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru MAILRq.L , internet group Yandex YNDX.O and mobile operator MTS MTSS.MM all have smart speakers on the market.   In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia\u2019s answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.  LIFE BEYOND BANKING  While Sberbank\u2019s diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.   BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.   Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.   \u201cHow do you earn money if you do banking business only?\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43151558209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-V9Y1-JCSC-J390-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000D8PQ</classCode><className>SBERBANK ROSSII OAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.    \u201cHow do you earn money if you do banking business only?\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43151441441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-V8Y1-JCSC-J4J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Edge Markets</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000D8PQ</classCode><className>SBERBANK ROSSII OAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

FILE PHOTO: A SberBox TV streaming device is seen in this undated handout picture. SberDevices/Handout via REUTERS   The company, which is dropping the word \u201cbank\u201d from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.   Sberbank\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \u201cSmartMarket\u201d, an equivalent to Apple\u2019s AppStore or Google Play.   \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it\u2019s a huge investment,\u201d he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.   The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country\u2019s oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.   In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia\u2019s digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \u201clargest transformation\u201d in its history.   \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\u201d Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.   Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.  NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE  Among Sberbank\u2019s new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.   Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple\u2019s Siri, Hey Google or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank\u2019s devices and mobile apps.   What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \u201ccultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\u201d Sberbank said.   The company\u2019s SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.   \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\u201d said Rafalovsky.  TECH\u2019S A RISKY BUSINESS  The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.   Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.   Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.   However Sberbank\u2019s costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.   Apple AAPL.O , Samsung 005930.KS and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru MAILRq.L , internet group Yandex YNDX.O and mobile operator MTS MTSS.MM all have smart speakers on the market.   In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia\u2019s answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.  LIFE BEYOND BANKING  While Sberbank\u2019s diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.   BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.   Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.   \u201cHow do you earn money if you do banking business only?\u201d she added.

The company, which is dropping the wor...</p><p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank SBER.MM , Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.   The company, which is dropping the word \u201cbank\u201d from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.   Sberbank\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \u201cSmartMarket\u201d, an equivalent to Apple\u2019s AppStore or Google Play.   \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it\u2019s a huge investment,\u201d he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.   The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country\u2019s oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.   In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia\u2019s digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \u201clargest transformation\u201d in its history.   \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\u201d Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.   Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.  NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE  Among Sberbank\u2019s new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.   Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple\u2019s Siri, Hey Google or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank\u2019s devices and mobile apps.   What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \u201ccultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\u201d Sberbank said.   The company\u2019s SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.   \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\u201d said Rafalovsky.  TECH\u2019S A RISKY BUSINESS  The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.   Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.   Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.   However Sberbank\u2019s costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.   Apple AAPL.O , Samsung 005930.KS and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru MAILRq.L , internet group Yandex YNDX.O and mobile operator MTS MTSS.MM all have smart speakers on the market.   In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia\u2019s answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.  LIFE BEYOND BANKING  While Sberbank\u2019s diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.   BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.   Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.   \u201cHow do you earn money if you do banking business only?\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43151157785</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-V9Y1-JCSC-J30K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000D8PQ</classCode><className>SBERBANK ROSSII OAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

Th...</p><p>Handout picture of SberPortal device More  By MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank, Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.   The company, which is dropping the word \"bank\" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.   Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \"SmartMarket\", an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play.   \"It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,\" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.   The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.   In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \"largest transformation\" in its history.   \"We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.   Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.   NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE   Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.   Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon's Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps.   What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \"cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\" Sberbank said.   The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.   \"It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\" said Rafalovsky.   TECH'S A RISKY BUSINESS   The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.   Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.   Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft's LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.   However Sberbank's costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.   Apple, Samsung and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru, internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market.   In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia's answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.  Story continues  LIFE BEYOND BANKING   While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.   BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.   Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.   \"How do you earn money if you do banking business only?\" she added.

It's a permanent stencil of a horse's head, visible just above her wrist. \"I started learning how to ride horses last May and I'm absolutely loving it,\" she says. \"So I got a little horse's head tattoo right here.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lennon's freshly inked art is unveiled in a significant week for Eir. Although its corporate results aren't due until next month, the former state monopoly has some figures which suggest the company is now unrecognisable from the administrative entity that used to stagger from corporate flip to corporate flip.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It raced to 100,000 new GoMo mobile customers in a matter of weeks after promising a lifetime tariff of (EURO)10 per month for a high-data, high-calls package.</p><p>It is approaching half a million 'passed' fibre-to-the-home premises and is promising another million, mostly in the previously untouchable cable broadband hinterland of Virgin Media.</p><p>And it is positioning itself for the collapse of traditional TV distribution with an alternate, Netflix-friendly system based on apps.</p><p>It is also taking a bullish, uncompromising position on Huawei as an equipment supplier in a week when the UK defied US pressure by allowing the Chinese company into its carriers' 5G rollout, albeit with potential restrictions.</p><p>Adrian Weckler sat down with Lennon to take the temperature on Eir's current fortunes and future plans.</p><p>Adrian Weckler (AW): You had big launches for GoMo and Eir TV last October, but no public launch for 5G. Why was that? Carolan Lennon (CL): We had a big internal launch with all of our suppliers in [Dublin's] Citywest.</p><p>AW: Was the rotating chairman of Huawei, Guo Ping, there? CL: Yes. He was invited and met Xavier [Niel, CEO of Eir's French parent company NJJ].</p><p>AW: Was the fact that Guo Ping was there related to you not having a public launch, given controversy over 5G network security? CL: No. He was here because he wanted to meet Xavier, who was going to be here for our 5G launch. So that worked out well.</p><p>He was planning to visit anyway, so we managed to get that timing right.</p><p>AW: What do you make of the Huawei controversy? CL: I find that hard to accept that it's not to do with the China-US trade issue. We're not concerned, we're very happy with them. They're in our access network, not our core network [which is Ericsson].</p><p>But we find them good to work with. Our guys say their kit is fantastic. Most of the telcos in Europe are using them.</p><p>The UK has now said that they're not going to block Huawei from their 5G networks. Our position hasn't changed at all.</p><p>AW: What do you make of the American argument that networks like yours that use Huawei equipment are less secure? CL: I disagree with that, Adrian. It's very hard to take the smoke away from everything that's going on around this.</p><p>But obviously, security is really important to us. We've just recently won the garda mobile business tender. So it's not stopping us winning business. Do American multinationals mention it? Yes. But has it stopped us winning business? No. It hasn't. So we're going to push on, we're committed to them, they've been a good supplier and we're very happy with the kit and the quality of the network.</p><p>AW: Your (EURO)9.99 GoMo mobile sign-up promotion ended and the current (EURO)12.99 'for life' sign-up campaign will end in a few weeks. What price will you set for GoMo then? CL: We haven't made a decision about that yet. We wanted to see what the elasticity was between (EURO)9.99 and (EURO)12.99 in terms of volume. Then we'll make a call.</p><p>AW: How many Eir Mobile customers has the GoMo service cannibalised? CL: Some customers have come from Eir Mobile. But it's well within our business case tolerance. It's delivering for Eir; not just volume, but also revenue.</p><p>AW: Where do you think you took most of the customers from? CL: It's certainly impacting on the Three prepay base. That Three prepay base grew, over the last number of years, on the back of their big data allowances which were more generous than anybody else's.</p><p>There's also Tesco Mobile, which was very good at playing the value card. But we've picked customers up from everybody.</p><p>AW: On the 'for life' promise, the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland says it is looking at your terms and conditions, which appear to say that you can change the (EURO)9.99 cost whenever you want.</p><p>CL: There's absolutely no issue there. If you signed up at (EURO)9.99, or now at (EURO)12.99, it's guaranteed for life. In terms of the terms and conditions, if something were to happen to international conditions, outside the core [(EURO)9.99] proposition, we reserve the right to change those. But the core proposition of (EURO)9.99 or (EURO)12.99 is guaranteed for life.</p><p>AW: Does this mean your overall mobile customer base has risen? CL: Yes. We're doing results in February so you'll see those mobile volumes coming through. When we launched in October, we thought 100,000 customers was an ambitious target. Even with the (EURO)9.99 'for life' message, we thought it would take us until June of this year. But we had 100,000 done before Christmas.</p><p>We've been blown away. To persuade 100,000 people to do something is not easy. It was only launched two days and we got feedback that scores of school WhatsApp groups were talking about it. It seemed to gather a life of its own.</p><p>AW: How can you make money from a (EURO)10-per-month, high-data service? CL: The margin there is better than you might think. The majority of customers have come from other networks on to our network so that's completely new revenue to Eir. It's a much cheaper proposition to serve because we don't have the big care or store infrastructure. This makes the margin better than you would think.</p><p>Add to this that we've seen a chunk of GoMo customers come from prepaid, where the average revenue per user is lower than on GoMo and the churn is higher, and we're very happy with the contribution that GoMo has made from a financial point of view.</p><p>AW: Will you add 5G to GoMo? CL: No, we have no plans to.</p><p>AW: If one of the main differences between GoMo and Eir Mobile is 5G [on Eir Mobile], does GoMo's strong performance suggest weak demand for 5G in Ireland? CL: Demand for 5G will come. There was a decent number of 5G handset sales at Christmas. But they're what you'd expect them to be, in the hands of early adopters who always want the new thing. It will take a while for the rest of the population of the mobile users to catch up. There's no Apple 5G device yet, but that will all come.</p><p>AW: Do you know yet what people will use 5G for? CL: We all talk about the obvious uses like e-health and autonomous cars. But we broadcast a Munster versus Saracens rugby game over 5G on Eir Sport, rather than via satellite. It worked pretty well.</p><p>I think it could be a good broadcasting application and much cheaper than current systems. It might give companies an opportunity to cover more games.</p><p>AW: How many 5G sites do you have? CL: About 170 across 20 towns and cities. It's now above 25pc population coverage. We're by far the biggest 5G network in the country.</p><p>AW: You had promised 300 5G sites by now. Have you looked at tepid demand and decided to refocus resources on filling out 4G sites first? CL: No. We're just managing what we can do with what sites are available.</p><p>AW: You recently switched your TV service to an Apple TV platform. A few years ago, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the future of TV would be apps. Is that what you're doing? CL: I think that's certainly the direction it's going. We see the future of TV moving away from linear [viewing]. If you look at the statistics, with most people, it's linear today, but a lot of people are moving to different apps.</p><p>We wanted to get on the front foot of that. With Disney Plus launching in March, that will be another app that will come up when you switch on.</p><p>AW: Eir's Apple platform is easy to use but you can't record much, especially channels like the BBC. Isn't that a drawback? CL: Yes, that's currently the biggest challenge. My parents were over at the weekend. They're on our old TV platform and I told them to stay there for the moment because they like to record from the BBC.</p><p>But those rights will come. They've never had to think about those rights in the past but everyone sees the way this is going. So over time, this is not going to be an issue.</p><p>AW: If TV is just moving to apps, why will anyone need a TV service, given that new tellies now come with the most popular on-demand video streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video? CL: Well, we'd say that you're getting linear TV and your sport or whatever, so it's the combination of all that which makes us attractive.</p><p>AW: On broadband, where are you with your fibre-to-the-home rollout? CL: On our rural build, we finished up with 340,000 homes passed last summer. We immediately turned that network team to look at our national fibre network.</p><p>So we have 28 towns across the country available now, including in some urban and suburban areas.</p><p>We'll add another 20 towns by the end of April. So the machine that was hitting 30,000 fibre-to-the-home households is now targeting urban and suburban areas, where we can hit 65,000 to 70,000 homes per quarter.</p><p>Our ambition is to bring fibre-to-thehome to 1.4 million homes, which is 84pc of the country. If you then add the National Broadband Plan, that puts Ireland right at the top in terms of broadband connectivity.</p><p>Our opportunity now is to take on [Virgin Media] cable. Eir has never had the network to take on cable. But the fibre network is better than the cable network because it's not contended. In the big towns and the cities, we're under-represented today. So this is our opportunity to grow that share.</p><p>AW: The National Broadband Plan has been signed and work is under way. It's possible that if Eir had been doing what it is doing today five years ago, there may not have been a need for this NBP.</p><p>It's also possible that Eir might even have scooped the extra network contract that you claimed it could do for (EURO)1bn in the Oireachtas last year when you arguably put a spanner in the NBP works. Did you miss your chance back then? Was it just the wrong time for Eir in those years? CL: There are a couple of things there. First of all, Eir is different today. We have a long-term telco investor who absolutely believes in decisions for the long term.</p><p>They [parent NJJ] fundamentally believe that the company with the best infrastructure of fixed and mobile will win the day. So making decisions is quicker and easier. Everything we said we were going to do last year, we have done.</p><p>At the same time, when Eir started building fibre to the cabinet, it was post-examinership. It had a certain amount of money and the question at the time was whether we go deep and narrow with fibre to the home, or broad with fibre to the cabinet. I don't know whether that was a wrong decision, but if you look at our recovery post-examinership, you'll see that the recovery was on the back of both wholesale and retail customers coming on to that fibre-to-the-cabinet network.</p><p>As for the National Broadband Plan, we weren't trying to put a spanner in the works. But if you were to ask me the same question again, then I'd tell you the truth and I'd be confident about that answer.</p><p>If I had a billion euro tomorrow and I hadn't taken my team and put them on building an urban and suburban network, I could do the rest of that [NBP] network.</p><p>That's still absolutely the case. I know how much it costs. We were asked the question and we gave an honest answer.</p><p>That said, we've moved on. All of our resources are focused now on the cities and the big towns. That's a five-year programme.</p><p>AW: So then you won't agree with Michael Ring's recent comments in the 'Sunday Independent' that Eir was \"acting like a spoiled child\" and that \"when the sweets are taken away from them, they start crying\"? That \"these are the ones who want to roll out rural broadband\", even when he \"can't get [Eir] out to elderly people with their senior alert alarms when their phones are out\"? CL: Well, when I finish picking my toys up and putting them back in the pram, I'll answer that. In all seriousness though, while he's entitled to his own opinion, the stuff on the repairs is just not factually true.

The Facebook chief executive is wearing a suit and tie for once and looks like a student on work experience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gnarled politicians with a regrettably loose grasp of what Facebook actually does ask the young billionaire about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Russian electoral interference and Facebook's role in distributing hate speech and fake news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are the vanguard of a backlash that has been brewing for months. Giant tech companies have become targets of suspicion because of their size and influence, their possibly addictive products and their apparent indifference to our privacy. So Zuckerberg is deferential. He apologises often. He gently explains his business model, pledges to do better and avoids saying anything memorable. Wall Street judges it a tactical triumph.</p><p>At the very same time, 4600km to the west, the chief executive of Apple is holding forth before a smaller panel of inquisitors. It consists, in fact, of only one person - me. Unlike Zuckerberg, Tim Cook is on home turf. We are sitting in an airy mezzanine dining area in Apple Park, the company's futuristic new headquarters in Cupertino, California.</p><p>Two media aides are listening in. Other employees are eating lunch nearby, undisturbed by their lowkey boss. A bodyguard was around earlier and is presumably still somewhere in case I attempt to exact violent retribution for that time my iPhone lost hundreds of Notes memos during an update.</p><p>In other words, this is not the showdown in Washington DC. But the wider context is the same, and Cook didn't get to run the world's most valuable company by mincing his words. \"There's certainly a negative narrative around Silicon Valley right now just in general,\" he says in his measured Alabama drawl. \"So I think it's important to tell everybody what our values are and be clear about those, because our users deserve to know that.\" Cook, 57, is in his regular uniform of jeans and trainers with an open-necked shirt, thin sweater and dark-framed glasses. A \"fitness nut\" who gets up before 4am most days to email and work out, he lives a life that is otherwise \"very focused on Apple\".</p><p>He is lean, straight-backed and silver-haired with slightly mechanical body language. His manner is warm and understated but calmly insistent.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Zuckerberg argues that Facebook is not an outlier. Photographs of his notes show that he is ready to say - although he doesn't - that Apple is \"similar\" to Facebook in terms of its collection of data and that his company is only a \"small part\" of the online ad market.</p><p>Google, for instance, also collects vast amounts of data about its users and has an advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook's.</p><p>Cook's approach is different. He maintains his company does not deserve to be corralled into any sort of public shaming for Big Tech. He wants you to know that this mess is not Apple's fault. \"Silicon Valley as a whole is not monolithic,\" he explains.</p><p>Unlike some other companies he could mention, but won't, Apple has regarded privacy as \"a basic human right\" for a long time and \"built the company around\" that belief. The intimate personal data profiles that companies such as Facebook and Google compile \"shouldn't exist\", Cook thinks.</p><p>On cybersecurity, he points out that most modern Apple devices have sophisticated defences built in and the company also protects its FaceTime and Messages apps with end-to-end encryption - unlike, say, Google's standard Gmail and Twitter direct messages. Unlike YouTube, Apple's App Store is \"curated\" to the extent that you (and your children) won't find hate speech or pornography there. On the environment, Apple has, just the day before, reached the \"huge milestone\" of running entirely on renewable energy.</p><p>As he ticks his points off, Cook leans slowly from one side to the other, planting his fingers down on the table for emphasis and making intense eye contact, like a concert pianist playing chords.</p><p>Despite a personal fortune estimated by Bloomberg at $787 million - and a company ruling that forbids him from flying anywhere except by private jet in the interests of security and efficiency - Cook is a man of apparently modest tastes driven primarily by strong moral convictions. He has told shareholders that Apple will do things because they are \"just and right\", even if there is no obvious profit to be made. In some small way he aspires to live up to the sacrifices of his heroes Martin Luther King Jr and Bobby Kennedy, whose portraits hang in his small top-floor office, opposite the plain desk with its Apple laptop and incongruously clunky in/out tray and landline telephone.</p><p>It was King and Kennedy's examples of fighting for equality that encouraged this very private man to come out publicly as gay in 2014, becoming the most prominent businessman to do so. In an essay written to provide inspiration to anyone wrestling with their identity, he wrote, \"Let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me\". He cited Dr King again last summer following the deadly racist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. In an email to Apple staff he stated that he disagreed with President Trump's reluctance to unequivocally condemn the white supremacists involved. \"This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality.\" He has \"profound disagreements\" with the Trump administration on many things, including immigration, climate change and trade, but says that his dealings with the administration have left him \"optimistic\" for America and the world.</p><p>Cook does not believe that he would be much of an activist. It is through business that he thinks he can create the most beneficial changes. When he talks about the good Apple does in the world, his pale blue eyes glisten. His disapproval for what he considers the irresponsible practices of other tech companies is equally evident. \"Even companies that people typically associate with each other, I think it's important to dig more,\" he says. \"There's a tendency to lump big ones together.\" There is. \"But what I found is: rarely are two substantial [companies] even similar ... in terms of the way they're run, the way they think, the way they make decisions.</p><p>They're very different.\" Doesn't he worry that those distinctions are lost on worried customers and on politicians around the world who are pressing for greater regulation of the technology sector? \"Well, I care most about our users, our users and our employees,\" Cook says.</p><p>\"Those are the two that I put on the pedestal. Users know that we prioritise the user experience, that that's what we're about. And employees want to be a part of a company that has a greater purpose to it.</p><p>And I think our employees know that [Apple is that]. And so, do I expect either of those groups would indiscriminately paint us with the same roller?\" Here he enthusiastically paints an imaginary wall between us with an imaginary roller. \"I don't think so. I don't think so.\" Right, but doesn't this climate encourage even Apple enthusiasts to think the worst of the company when unfavourable news does break?</p><p>For example, when leaked documents revealed in November that much of Apple's $330 billion stash of offshore cash had been moved to a tax haven in the English Channel? Or when it emerged in January that the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the company over a software update that deliberately slowed down older iPhones?</p><p>Cook offers an inscrutable smile. \"We're large and there will always be allegations and so forth.</p><p>We have to be clear about our view and how we look at it. Will anybody say, 'Tech is bad, and I look at those two [stories] and that proves that you're bad'? Some people will. But I think the number of those [people] is very small.\" We had first met two weeks earlier in Chicago.</p><p>The occasion was the unveiling of the latest iPad, essentially an update aimed largely at the education market. Of course, the company introduced it to the world with all the restraint of a new Star Wars movie. For a company with a minimalist sensibility, Apple loves a gaudy product launch.</p><p>On the dot of 10am, the lights went down, hundreds of iPhones were thrust into the air to capture the moment and on a giant screen a gorgeously shot film of smiling children in a school playground began. In the voiceover a child's voice said, \"We can make anything we want and we can make it change the world\". The lights came up and Cook wandered on stage to a rock-star welcome. He wore black trainers, fawn chinos and a navy blue sweater.</p><p>Cook doesn't try to emulate his visionary predecessor, the late Steve Jobs, who was a master of the theatrical product launch. Instead, Cook ceded the stage for most of this presentation to a cast of Apple executives and teachers from the US and Britain who sang the new device's praises.</p><p>Cook returned at the end of the presentation, like an archbishop delivering the final blessing and dismissal after Holy Communion. \"We believe that our place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful tools that amplify learning and creativity,\" he said. \"This is something that only Apple can do.\" Talking to Cook in the upstairs library afterwards, he was vigilant and composed, and betrayed no hint of post-event adrenalin. \"We want to remind people how important education is to the company and how we think that education is a great equaliser,\" he said. He talked about how Apple is teaching children around the world to code as a way to level educational playing fields.</p><p>The company is also betting big on augmented reality (AR), a technology that Cook loves because it encourages interaction and enhances people's performance rather than replacing them. One app puts a virtual frog on your table. Looked at through an iPad, you can zoom in and examine the frog's appearance or its muscular system and throbbing organs or, with an Apple pencil, dissect it. AR \"changes education. I think it changes business. I think it changes the consumer. I think it changes the world,\" Cook said.</p><p>I asked him what he had meant earlier by \"this is something only Apple can do\". \"I think most companies in the technology industry are almost solely focused on technology.</p><p>That's fine. That's not a criticism, but they're solely focused on that. Apple has always fused humanity into technology.\" The company was all about \"providing the user [with products] that would empower them to express their passion or to change the world in some way ... We're fine with being the Lone Ranger there. We think it's a special place.\" When I interviewed the chief executive of Microsoft last year, though, he too talked a lot about helping people fulfil their potential. Satya Nadella's stated vision for his company is \"to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more\". What about Microsoft?</p><p>A hint of disapproval crept into Cook's expression.</p><p>\"Do you see anybody sitting in front of a Windows PC feeling empowered and creative?\" We moved on to screen time. In January, on a visit to Britain, Cook said, \"I don't have a kid, but I have a nephew I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won't allow; I don't want them on a social network.\" Two activist shareholders with a combined Apple stake worth about $US2 billion recently called on Apple to create ways for parents to restrict children's iPhone access and to invest in research into the effects of heavy screen usage.</p><p>The company responded, earlier this month announcing measures to counter concerns about the intrusiveness of screens. New \"do not disturb\" controls mean that at designated periods such as bedtime, users can set their phones to block all incoming notifications from appearing on the home screen. They will also get a weekly breakdown of their usage and be able to set limits on the time they and their children spend on certain apps. The company also announced a crackdown on web companies' ability to monitor online activity, saying that its Safari browser would ask for permission before allowing tracking from sites such as Facebook.</p><p>Cook told me that there \"should be\" serious concerns about the mental health impact on children in particular of spending too much time with their screens. But he said he was \"not hearing\" that Apple's devices were addictive. It's the apps made for them that he's \"deeply worried about\".</p><p>From there it wasn't hard to skewer Twitter, Facebook and others without mentioning them by name. The real problem, Cook said, is the corrosive need to check \"what the latest post is\" or tally \"how many likes have I had?\" \"We're in a sort of unique position there, because we don't measure our success by how much time somebody's using our product. We don't want you using our product all the time,\" he added. \"You need to do other things in your life as well, right?</p><p>\"If you have a model that is based solely on digital advertising, that can lead you down a path where the user isn't the user any more. The user is the product. The customer is the advertiser and the desire is as many clicks as you can get.\" He frowned.</p><p>\"The user is lost in that. Humanity is lost in that.\" Cook grew up in Robertsdale, Alabama, which he has described as a small town \"on the road to the beach\". He was one of three sons born to Don, a shipyard worker, and Geraldine, who worked in a pharmacy. A star student at high school and then at Auburn and Duke universities, he rose through the Silicon Valley management chain at IBM and Compaq. Looking back, though, he thinks he was \"rudderless\". \"I was spending a ton of time at work working really hard ... but the purposes were to become more productive or more efficient. There wasn't a north star that was the gravitational pull.\" Then, in 1998, Cook met Steve Jobs. At the time Jobs was embarking on his second stint in charge at Apple, the triumphal comeback that would cement his place in business folklore. \"My intuition told me that joining Apple would be a oncein-a-lifetime opportunity to work for a creative genius,\" Cook would later tell Jobs' biographer, Walter Isaacson. He loved Apple from day one.</p><p>Joining was \"sort of like being born again\", Cook says now. The company had a sense of mission, a \"different soul\" to it. \"There was a reason for the company and, for me, that was an incredible feeling that I'd never felt before.\" Cook slashed supplier numbers, warehouse numbers, inventories and the time it took to make an Apple product. He became Jobs' \"indispensable backstage partner\", Isaacson wrote.</p><p>In 2004, he filled in as interim chief executive for two months while Jobs recovered from cancer surgery. At the time some analysts ridiculed the idea that the steady Cook might become a longterm successor. But in August 2011, Jobs resigned and made his friend chief executive. Six weeks later, Jobs was dead. \"I had convinced myself that he would live longer than I would,\" says Cook.</p><p>\"And I look back now and I think, you know, the set of circumstances would have said that that was a really dumb thing to think, but I thought it. He always bounced. I had seen him go down before and always come back up.\" Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company and a good friend of both men, joined Apple's board shortly after Jobs' death. That period was perhaps Cook's finest hour, Iger tells me. \"He stepped into some rather large shoes at the beginning, knowing that there was no other Steve and also in deep mourning himself for his personal loss, with everybody at Apple. So he begins his real tenure as CEO with a dark cloud over everyone. A very painful thing. And from the beginning he was steady. His legs never seemed like they were giving out. Apple needed that. They needed someone to hold on to and he was that for them.\" Cook's leadership was tested in December 2015 when the Obama administration leaned heavily on Apple to unlock the iPhone of a homegrown terrorist who had carried out a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The company refused because of the precedent such a move would set. A national debate raged over how to balance privacy against security. Eventually the FBI found a mysterious third party who hacked the device anyway.</p><p>\"We learnt a lot,\" Cook says. \"The lesson I was most shocked over was that when the government turns against you, there's a very nasty side of it. And that the rule book I always thought was there can be thrown out the window. Obviously, I was naive.\" Steve Jobs hoped the enormous ring-shaped \"spaceship\" where we are sitting now would be \"the best office building in the world\". Time will tell - staff only began moving into Apple Park late last year - but at a reported cost of $6.5 billion, it is almost certainly the most expensive.</p><p>Sunlight pours in through the giant exterior curved glass panel that stretches four storeys from the floor to the ceiling far above us. At ground level, staff glide past on silver bicycles and gardeners with saplings tramp through the unfinished landscape. Glance in the opposite direction through more glass at the huge garden in the complex's centre and there are pathways, tables and more trees. Staff pace along glass corridors that wrap around the main interior wall. The ones on the higher floors look like they are striding through the sky. The overall effect of the place is so hypnotic that later, re-emerging through the security gate into the real world, I feel briefly violated by the ugliness of traffic, litter and boxy buildings.</p><p>The knock against Cook since he took over has been that Apple has not come up with a product to match the iMac, the iPhone or the iPad since 2011. One response would be: so who has? Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with the tech-focused research firm Creative Strategies, disregards the \"if Steve were alive\" grumbles, which she expects to continue for years to come.</p><p>There has been innovation - notably the Apple Watch. There have also been \"impressive improvements\" to existing products, well-managed expansion and diversification. Cook has come into his own, she says, by \"trading on his strengths\", especially through expanding Apple's engagement with social concerns.</p><p>And about his industry? What about that \"negative narrative\" around Silicon Valley he spoke about earlier? Is it a blip or here to stay?\"I think it's a combination of things,\" Cook says. \"Something's happened that has brought great focus on that. But it's [also] sort of the natural outgrowth of tech becoming a large percentage of the economy. With the success comes more scrutiny, which is right. I think scrutiny is good. I don't agree with all of the points being made by any means, but I think scrutiny in and of itself, for companies that are large and are in industries that touch so many people's lives every day - this is a must.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AustralianMagazine20180616Main30000374159937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJV-GCN1-F0JP-W444-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3183\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Magazine</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 16, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

(forcing) us to hyper-accelerate our movement to the cloud and to digital communication,\" Edgar said. While trends toward remote work existed previously, the pandemic has rapidly driven those trends forward. It has increased our susceptibility to security and privacy threats, such as by necessitating virtual communication platforms.\u00a0</p><p>Cybersecurity for communication</p><p>Zoom, the primary video communication platform used in much of the world and by the University, was initially unprepared to handle cybersecurity for the onslaught of new users due to the pandemic, Edgar said. The American company has made significant improvements in the past few months, such as giving users greater control of where their Zoom data is stored. But Zoom's technological dependence on China for its hardware infrastructure has \"raised a lot of concerns in many Western countries, including the U.S., about cyberspying by the Chinese government,\" Edgar said.</p><p>Still, in comparison to alternative platforms, Edgar said that the University cannot be faulted for relying on Zoom for courses and communication. \"Brown is in the same position as a lot of universities,\" he said, needing \"a platform that is easy to use and functional.\"\u00a0</p><p>Edgar's main concern with Zoom lies in the recording of lectures and discussions on the platform. Since the University's transition to fully remote learning in March, classes have commonly been recorded in order to accommodate students taking courses in different time zones. While Edgar understands the importance of recording university courses, \"we do need to be very careful that we don't simply decide that the recording of everything that we do is now suddenly acceptable for convenience reasons,\" he said.</p><p>The University's IT Service Center currently recommends that faculty download and post recorded Zoom calls through the Canvas website, which uses a secure software called Panopto, Director of Information Security Mark Dieterich said. Students taking asynchronous classes are only able to view recorded lectures on Canvas through Panopto, which allows \"fine-grain control\" - limiting access to those in a specific section of a class, for instance. But Zoom also allows hosts to download recorded meetings to the cloud; if this happens, the video will be automatically deleted after a year, and a Brown log-in is required for access if it is shared before its deletion.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Brown has been focused on flexibility. We want to do everything we can to make things secure, but we don't want to make it so hard to use that it's no longer attractive; that's one of the fine lines we need to walk in security,\" Dieterich said.</p><p>The University does not currently require the use of waiting rooms and passcodes, which would raise the barrier of entry for meeting attendees, and instead leaves the decision up to each faculty member, Dieterich said. The University notified the Brown community Aug. 28 that Zoom would mandate the use of waiting rooms and passcodes. But Zoom has since backed away from this decision, prompting the University to release a follow-up announcement Sept. 24 stating that these safety precautions are encouraged but not required.</p><p>Zoom-bombing - the intrusion of uninvited guests into a meeting - last occurred at the University in early April. No Zoom-bombings have been reported since, Dieterich said.\u00a0</p><p>A staple feature on Zoom is the chat function, which allows meeting attendees to send messages either publicly to everyone in the meeting or privately to a person of their choice. Public chats are accessible by the meeting host and the administration after a meeting ends; messages are not downloaded automatically, but may be downloaded by the host at their discretion. The University administration can also use chat information in the case that they are legally bound by subpoena, but will not use the information in any other situation, according to Dieterich. There is no record of private chats after the meeting ends, he said.\u00a0</p><p>As one recently added security measure, Zoom has employed staff to monitor public feeds on Twitter and notify respective meeting hosts about meeting links and passcodes that have been accidentally shared in tweets.</p><p>University measures to combat online security breaches</p><p>\"Higher education is one of the most attacked industries\" because of the profitability of intellectual property located within academic institutions' virtual systems, Dieterich said. The IT Center currently uses multiple firewalls within the University network that detect between 13,000 and 450,000 suspicious network connections each day. Only around two percent of these connections are permitted through the firewall to the next layer of defense, according to Dieterich.\u00a0</p><p>The University has implemented various types of security measures to build these barriers. Edgewise, a technology installed this fall, safeguards against attacks across different segments of the network. A different tool called STINGAR based at Duke University purposefully entices attackers to identify and block them, and it caught 5 million such users within its first day of use.\u00a0</p><p>The University has also partnered with the Department of Homeland Security to measure how effectively they're scanning for vulnerabilities in their security system.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But, \"there's no perfect security, and even very good security can sometimes be undermined (with) enough resources,\" Edgar said. For example, intelligence services \"with the resources of nation-states\" can scour digital platforms to uncover information - a topic he expands upon in his book Beyond Snowden: Privacy, Mass Surveillance and the Struggle to Reform the NSA.\u00a0</p><p>International privacy concerns and conflict</p><p>TikTok\u00a0 - a video-sharing social media platform owned by ByteDance, a company based in China - has also led to concerns about cybersecurity and exemplifies the dynamic surrounding technological dominance.</p><p>The platform \"raises a whole host of questions around global cyber power and what appears to be a shift from the existing situation in which the United States has been absolutely dominant,\" Edgar said.\u00a0</p><p>Previously, big tech companies in the United States have prevented strict regulations concerning technology \"on the grounds that we don't want anything to stifle the innovation that has given the U.S. such dominance in the global tech world,\" Edgar said. But cybersecurity concerns with China's leverage over Zoom and TikTok have revealed the ramifications of an unregulated technology market.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>John Savage, professor emeritus of computer science and member of the Rhode Island Secretary of State's Help America Vote Act Task Force, expressed concerns about security from this underlying competition. He is co-authoring the book Security in the Cyberage: Introduction into Policy and Technology with Derek Reveron, professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, about encryption, the ethics of artificial intelligence and laws regarding cyberspace.</p><p>\"What worries me the most is that domestic politics, both in this country and in China, are causing tensions between the two countries to be elevated,\" which may make the United States more prone to security threats, Savage said. There is additional concern over Russian interference through cyberhacking for the upcoming presidential election, he said.\u00a0</p><p>Fears of cyberattacks may lead countries to localize the storage of their data, leading to a less global Internet and limiting dominance by American technology companies within North America and Chinese companies within Asia, Edgar said. But a more likely scenario involves technology companies retaining their global reach while also accommodating for the interests of individual nations.</p><p>Proactive steps for individuals to stay cyber safe</p><p>New digital and technological developments raise \"lots of concerns, but it's like every other technology we've seen before. Somehow we humans found a way to cope with it,\" Savage said.</p><p>Given that, the legal system and its understanding of cyber issues are not adequate to address the issues that come with new technology, he added.\u00a0</p><p>A single election or law will not resolve cybersecurity issues, but people must \"try to work together to formulate some sound and reasonable policies that allow us to take advantage of (the benefits of technology) without giving up the fundamental rights that we all think are very important,\" Edgar said, echoing his sentiment.</p><p>To stay protected while using any kind of technology, Dieterich recommends updating devices' operating systems and applications, creating strong, unique passwords and using two-factor authentication (which sends a notification to a user's device to approve or deny a log-in) whenever possible.</p><p>Email users should also be wary of \"phishing,\" emails trying to obtain private information from the user, which may impersonate legitimate users through similar addresses.\u00a0</p><p>Recommended steps for protection are accessible to University students on the CIS Center website.\u00a0</p><p>Dieterich stressed to students that the IT Service Center is \"ultimately here as a service organization, and if you ever have questions ... we're there to help you.\"\u00a0</p><p>In this new digital age, \"you need to be an informed digital citizen that's looking after your privacy and those of others,\" Edgar said.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4771363</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YY-HS81-JBSN-3065-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Brown Daily Herald: Brown University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Providence</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>RI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DPHO</classCode><className>VIRTUAL EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000649</classCode><className>ESPIONAGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001696</classCode><className>TELECOMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Instead, readers will get an honest look at a burgeoning industry backed by big investors who see cultured meat\u2019s many upsides but also recognize its many hurdles.</p><p>You call it \u201ccell-cultured meat\u201d and not \u201clab-grown meat\u201d or \u201cfake meat\u201d or other names that sometimes come up. </p><p>The weirdest name I heard someone use was \u201cmotherless meat.\u201d Gross. The name game can be a bizarre rabbit hole. Because of that, I stuck to a term that\u2019s scientifically accurate and not aphoristic.</p><p>Were there any misconceptions you had about the industry going into it? </p><p>It turned out to be a more dramatic story than I anticipated. At one point, through pure happenstance, I watched firsthand the dramatic collapse of one startup\u2019s attempt to serve up cell-cultured meat in the Netherlands. That was the moment I really understood that there\u2019s an edible space race going on among cultured meat companies, and the winner will get the first shot at capturing public imagination \u2014 and tons of investment.</p><p>Who are the key players?</p><p>In the short term, in the U.S. folks in business are going to gravitate toward Memphis Meats, which has a regulatory edge; JUST, an already-functioning food company; and Finless Foods, which is ahead of the curve in seafood. Mosa Meat in the Netherlands has a great shot at getting E.U. approval first. In the long term, though, I\u2019m most drawn to what\u2019s happening in Israel, at Aleph Farms and Future Meat Technologies.</p><p>What\u2019s the strangest thing you ate during your reporting? </p><p>The first thing I was served was foie gras. On its surface that seemed pretty ho-hum, but then I realized it was basically just cultured meat paste that\u2019d been scraped out of a bioreactor. It was fine, but mentally took a minute to process.</p><p>What do you hope readers take away from the book?</p><p>There\u2019s enough money and influence behind cell-cultured meat that, even if it inspires squeamishness, it simply can\u2019t be ignored. There are a ton of upsides, especially in light of how the coronavirus has pummeled the U.S. meat industry. It may be the most optimistic and realistic shot we\u2019ve got at addressing animal agriculture\u2019s massive environmental footprint.</p><p>The speed read</p><p>Deals</p><p> The coming I.P.O. of Albertsons, the grocery-market giant, could raise as much as $1.5 billion for existing investors like Cerberus.

He says the Trump administration's approaches to tariffs and big-tech regulation are giving China the upper hand. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. President Donald Trump once declared, via his Twitter[2] account, that trade wars are \"good, and easy to win.\" That was more than a year ago. </p><p>Since then, he has escalated the trade dispute with China, threatened a new one with Mexico, and heightened the risk of an economic recession[3]. So maybe trade wars are neither good nor easy to win. Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor and founder of Duquesne Capital, is among those who disagree with Trump. \"I will go to my grave \u2014 you're not going to tell me that protectionism is as good as free trade,\" he said at a recent event hosted by the Economic Club of New York. \"I just don't believe it.\" Be it a financial or technological conflict between the world's two largest economies, Druckenmiller sees no path to victory for the US it continues on its current trajectory.  He realized the losing strategy after observing how Trump was waging his trade war. Trump wants to run on tariffs in 2020 and thinks it's a winning formula for the swing states he needs to secure a second term, Druckenmiller said. In turn, this means he's unlikely to budge on giving China's Xi Jinping a real deal.

While there's a real immigration issue, Mexico has cooperated with the Trump administration's reconstitution of the North America Free Trade Agreement, Druckenmiller said. \"To me, Xi Jinping and the hardliners just got a very, very big gift from Donald Trump doing what he did to Mexico,\" he said. And that's not all. Trump's approach to the so-called tech cold war between both countries will also hand China a win in the long run, according to Druckenmiller. His issue lies with how both countries are regulating their technology giants. \"The minute this trade stuff started happening last fall, they started easing up on their private sector, particularly Tencent[5] and Alibaba[6],\" Druckenmiller said. He added: \"They're huge supporters of Huawei[7]. They're oiling their whole tech machine. What are we doing? We're saving steel, coal, aluminum \u2014 they're really the future here guys. And what are we doing with our leading tech companies? We're throwing sand in the gears and making their lives miserable.\" He decried critics of American tech giants like Alphabet[8] who say that they're anti-competitive and harming consumers. Alphabet has already been probed and fined by European regulators, but the Department of Justice is reportedly gearing up for its own antitrust investigations[9].  \"I am not a nationalist,\" Druckenmiller said. \"But if we're going to be in some kind of conflict, it's going to be fought among the big tech companies. We're going to get rolled.\"NOW WATCH: Incredible animation shows just how big supermassive black holes can get[10]See Also: Investors are leaning on the Fed to keep the stock market's rally alive.

It is not quite the same as Instagram, where we can put up pictures of what we want the world to see of us.</p><p>InstaGrat is the instant gratification that is engineered into almost every social media application that we use today. It is that soft, sudden feeling of \u2018aah\u2019 that comes and goes, without quite making the same mess or causing all the same guilt of other sources of dopamine-shot releasing activities that boomers, Gen Xers and even nominally normal millennial creatures used to be used to.</p><p>Today, every human being within six feet of a smartphone and forty five miles of a 4G cell tower, has access to InstaGrat. And most of us are ODing on InstaGrat without ever knowing who we\u2019re working for as we furiously type out our rage against the machine on Facebook, or whilst we jealously click \u2018Like\u2019 on Insta videos of beautiful people with eyelashes thick as a brick, and cheekbones higher than the Himalayas, or as we mass forward the latest outrageous video of yet another injustice in this relentlessly cruel world over WhatsApp. With every click, every forward, and every expression of how we feel, we feel like we feel better (we don\u2019t really). That\u2019s InstaGrat.</p><p>The human physiology that Mark Zuckerberg, who runs Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, or Jack Dorsey, who runs Twitter, are exploiting is not particularly complicated, once we consider the wider ecosystem in which their algorithms are operating. Sean Parker, who founded Napster and was the first president of Facebook explains it in the best and most direct way possible: 'The thought process that went into building these applications was: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u2019'.</p><p>A global army of ambitious technology entrepreneurs are being egged on, and cheerled into an abyss of micro-manipulations and macro-catastrophe, by venture capitalists and Wall Street bankers, eagerly seeking the next Snapchat or the next TikTok, with little or no concern for how these technological applications are affecting individual and collective behaviors.</p><p>Of course, like any slow motion disaster, both state and society are so poorly equipped to handle the challenges posed by this phenomenon, that any attempt at addressing the problem likely only exacerbates it. For one, the easiest way to draw regulatory or legislative attention to these problems is to demonize the companies and individuals involved. Strangely, and paradoxically, this satisfies our insatiable need for InstaGrat, but it doesn\u2019t actually solve the underlying problems that are driving us over the cliff, way, way over the speed limit.Image: Statista</p><p>The role of social media in voice creation and amplification for ordinary people all around the world is no less revolutionary, at least in theory, than Gutenberg\u2019s printing press. But the human technology that fuels the magnitude of social media\u2019s impact seems as or more likely to be exploited by wealthy people at the expense of the non-wealthy quite exactly in the same way as any technological revolution ever did before, from the printing press, to the steam engine, to the radio and television.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, who was once responsible for \u2018user growth\u2019 at Facebook, recently explained his personal guilt about being associated with the social media business in rather stark and extreme terms, suggesting that the \u201cshort-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works\u201d. And if you take a long hard look at some of the evidence, this hyperbole may not be all wrong.</p><p>Last year, Trevor Haynes, a researcher at the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, wrote about dopamine and smartphones, claiming that social media applications essentially \u201cleverage the very same neural circuitry used by slot machines and cocaine to keep us using their products as much as possible\u201d. Now consider this: slot machines are heavily regulated by gaming or gambling commissions in some nations and entirely banned in many others. Cocaine, on the other hand, is a banned, illegal substance pretty much everywhere on planet earth. Yet there is hardly any country on the very same planet where social media is fully regulated (unless of course, we consider North Korea, or Iran, or China to be models of regulation).</p><p>The China question especially interesting, especially from the vantage point of Pakistan. The newest global fad among social media platforms is an application called TikTok. TikTok has about 12 million Pakistani users, which is nearly twice the number of Twitter users in the country \u2013 despite having only existed since 2017 (Twitter is about eleven years older, having been founded in 2006). So many of the world\u2019s most important people and pressing issues use Twitter as a source and an amplifier, but hardly any use TikTok. Why? Because unlike Twitter, TikTok is actually fun. It is video, after video, after video of inane (and sometimes insane) young people having fun.Have you read?</p><p>This algorithm can spot depression by studying your Instagram posts Is social media making people depressed? Facebook could be changing our offline social lives too</p><p>Since it is all about the \u2018fun\u2019, it is explicitly apolitical, or at least it says it wants to be. This matters little in the United States, where earlier this month, the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) initiated a national security investigation into TikTok. The ostensible reason is around concerns about user privacy, but this is about as believable as Alice Well\u2019s anguish about Pakistan\u2019s long-term external debt profile. The real reason that any technology company ends up in ostensibly hot water in the US is the ability of an antagonist to link the company to either Russia or China.</p><p>The national security angle to how countries respond to technology challenges is typical of the vulgarity and lack of sophistication that defines how public imagination is engaged on big tech\u2019s threat to our individual and collective well being and safety. Any country can manipulate the algorithms deployed by companies like Snapchat, or WhatsApp, or Twitter. The real question is whether governments and societies are willing to engage in a serious conversation about InstaGrat. This is unlikely.</p><p>The constant highs that social media applications offer through instant gratification undermine our ability to engage with information beyond the very temporary and superficial level. This means that any given viral video can have massive impact in terms of how fast it reaches people. Sometimes, this will produce \u2018instant\u2019 results \u2013 like the closure of a restaurant or a medicine store after viral videos of wrongdoing by such establishments surface. But these \u2018results\u2019 will not and cannot produce better legislation or regulation, or more vigilant enforcement of existing laws or rules. Decision-makers are just like all the rest of us. They too are being re-wired like the rest of us, and will therefore respond, and react more readily to the \u2018instant\u2019 notification, rather than the wider, creeping signs that scream out for reform.</p><p>InstaGrat heightens and transforms the micro-outrage into the macro-moment. But a moment is just that: a blip in time. Societies and countries are at sea in the face of a blitzkrieg of algorithms that have all the potential to positively transform the very micro-interactions within the human physiology that they have deconstructed and cracked. But this potential is being lost to the allure of the InstaGrat. We do not need a hashtag to do better. We just need to learn to say no to instant gratification. Can you say no?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2676755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN9-5JF1-F0YC-N3VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Both authorities and everyday citizens have access to search tools that can \"out\" someone from even the tiniest clues; even peaceable demonstrators are right to fear being fired or publicly shunned if their presence at a protest is discovered and then widely broadcast. Thus it is no accident that civil rights and privacy are intimately interlinked. Indeed, as law enforcement departments have become more militarized, they have equipped themselves with increasingly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/10/15/the-surveillance-state-goes-local-area-police-departments-may-be-using-stingray-technology-to-spy-on-you-without-a-warrant-and-the-feds-dont-want-you-to-know/\">sophisticated surveillance technology</url> - from devices that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/10/15/the-surveillance-state-goes-local-area-police-departments-may-be-using-stingray-technology-to-spy-on-you-without-a-warrant-and-the-feds-dont-want-you-to-know/\">intercept cell phone signals</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/09/29/whatsapp-backdoorwill-facebook-be-forced-to-break-message-encryption-as-reported/#15b143c11b38\">backdoors</url> into social media sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the civil rights battle over the right privacy is not waged on the street with protest signs and banners - at least, not generally. Privacy struggles are waged in more subtle ways, often through individual choices we make on our gadgets. We are told to \"resist\" by abandoning digital services; to \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/opinion/location-privacy.html\">break up with Google Maps</url>,\" so as to prevent some of our personal data from falling into the hands of the corporations who profit off of it.</p><p>Yet this very neoliberal notion of personal agency fails to acknowledge the role these services play in modern life. Being asked to resist only punishes those of us struggling to preserve our privacy. To imagine a world where privacy is preserved we need to explore what privacy truly means and to name it, for to name something is to own it.</p><p>What does it mean to see privacy as a civil rights struggle? The collapse of our privacy is exposing each of us to palpable risks: the erosion of the right to pray, to study, to congregate, or to participate in our democracy. In a digital world, privacy is the barrier between civil society and racial, political, or religious profiling writ large.</p><p>The rise of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/11/11/how-surveillance-capitalism-became-the-pre-eminent-business-model-of-silicon-valley/\">surveillance capitalism</url> - the buying and selling of our identities and our data - may herald the death knell of privacy. Social media and targeted online advertising are designed to allure us; in the process, we are losing our rights to anonymity and accelerating the erosion of our civil rights. Proposed individual \"solutions\" - such as configuring our       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/personaltech/protect-yourself-on-facebook.html\">social media privacy settings</url> or using the anonymous       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor web browser</url> - are at best half-measures. A personal example best illustrates why.</p><p>Like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/office-of-personnel-management-hackers-got-data-of-millions.html\">21.5 million Americans</url>, I too had my personal information stolen by Chinese hackers in the 2015 breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). To compensate me for their failure to protect my records (and that of every member of my family and relatives) I was provided with credit monitoring services from Experian, one of the big three credit bureaus. The primary result of this service is that I'm now flooded with offers to sign up for new credit cards carefully selected by Experian based on my credit score. My reward for being an OPM breach victim is to receive targeted spam that uses my personal information to benefit Experian and its commercial partners.</p><p>With the arrival of COVID-19, and the subsequent demands for contact tracing, we are all about to have our own individual privacy breach. In order to be effective, the results of any COVID-19 testing will need to be shared far beyond just you and your doctor. Counties, states, and possibly even national agencies will need access to test results. At scale, truly effective contact tracing will likely require very detailed location information, the kind your phone can trivially provide. In the current situation, your data won't be hacked by a foreign government, but freely given to assist with public safety.</p><p>Like many of us in the middle class, I and most writers on privacy tend to focus on the visible accoutrements of status, i.e., our phones, our online services, and our social media profiles. And with good reason, these are at the intersection of surveillance capitalism and consumers: services that have been instrumented to feed your personal information back into the engine powering those very services.</p><p>But the stakes are much higher than you may realize, for privacy is truly our civil rights struggle in the 21st century. Privacy violations are a gateway to identity-based targeting, which singles out individuals by race, religion, or gender identity. Yet with over 1 billion, mostly apathetic users, fighting Google (or Facebook or Experian for that matter) may move you to turn your despair into resignation.</p><p>So what does a world where our privacy is preserved look like?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy and personal information are not the same</emphasis></p><p>Many headlines call out the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/internet-death-privacy-google-facebook-alex-preston\">demise of</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/internet-death-privacy-google-facebook-alex-preston\">privacy</url>, but what they really mean is that some of your <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">personal information</emphasis> is being sold, or stolen, or simply misused. The two concepts are not quite the same. It is reasonable to consider the loss of personal information under the general heading of privacy, but separating the two concepts opens the door to a more effective conversation about how to protect them both.</p><p>When we read about Facebook or Google (or our own government) wanting to listen in on your phone calls, read your emails, or review your Facebook feed, we're talking about privacy, pure and simple. Privacy in this case means <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">freedom to engage in conversation or thought without unwanted or unknown surveillance.</emphasis> This is the notion of privacy that most of us think about when using the word \"private.\" Our outrage is palpable when this notion of privacy is egregiously violated. Even Amazon was forced to respond to public outrage when it was revealed that Amazon employees could listen to your Alexa commands. (Amazon recently announced that they'd enable \"options\" that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/amazon-gives-option-to-disable-human-review-of-alexa-recordings\">permit you to block sub-contractors</url> of Amazon to eavesdrop on your requests to Amazon Alexa.)</p><p>Protecting one's personal information takes us into a different realm with more everyday practical implications. When I give Google my phone number in exchange for a Gmail or Google Voice account, I'm exchanging my data for a service. And I suspect most of us are fine with this type of value-based trade-off. Google needs to know where to route my Google Voice phone calls or how to text me an alert related to my account. It's Google's subsequent reuse of this information where things start to go awry.</p><p>Whether it's Google, Facebook, or the gym down the street, companies reuse, release, and resell this personal information. They allow third-parties to use this information to figure out what ads to show you in your account. Most people who spend time online are familiar with this experience, which does not always feel intrusive. Just the other day I was researching the dog food we feed our dogs and by that evening Google had displayed several ads for dog food brands in my Gmail inbox.</p><p>Dog food is only the beginning. If you do a quick Google search of anyone's name, you'll find dozens of offers to sell you a background check and other information about the subject of your search, (as a side note, many of these services are owned by the same company, they merely rebrand themselves to fool you). In the digital world your personal data is collected, repackaged, then correlated with other information to enrich the commercial understanding of you as a consumer. Even a cursory examination of the websites you visit will quickly reveal your political and sexual orientation, your racial identity, your ethnic heritage, and socio-economic status. Add to that your buying history, your Facebook friends, the people you follow on Twitter or Instagram, and a detailed profile of you emerges that probably transcends your own understanding of yourself.</p><p>Even if you feel comfortable with targeted advertising, the use of your personal information as fuel for the digital economy has a sinister aftermath few realize.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy equals civil rights</emphasis></p><p>Oppression originates whenever one group marks another group as \"other,\" then uses that \"otherness\" to isolate, discriminate, and disempower. Often the markers for discriminatory behavior are obvious: darker skin, for example, or observation of gender.</p><p>But what if every marker of your individuality were known and sold, accessible to advertisers without your knowledge? The potential for manipulation or oppression is palpable, as one could easily use personal information for these suspect marking purposes. In 2016, the Russian Internet Research agency used Facebook to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/05/18/steve-bannon-tried-to-suppress-black-votes-cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-says/\">target ads at Black voters</url>, ads designed to depress their voter turnout. Facebook had already siphoned up all of their vital personal details; all that the Russian Internet Research agency had to do was click a few buttons picking out the demographic they wished to target.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/10/14/497911812/as-iraqi-forces-prepare-to-attack-mosul-a-civilian-exodus-could-follow\">2016 NPR article</url> mentions that the Iraqi army used Facebook data to identify students attending an ISIS run school. In the case of Cambridge Analytica,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/03/19/cambridge-analytica-faces-increased-scrutiny-over-harvesting-facebook-users-data/\">Facebook data that was inappropriately acquired</url> was used to create unusually manipulative advertising for valuable voter demographics. And let's not forget this horrific tidbit, that Facebook \"played a determining role\" in the mass slaughter and rape of Rohingya in Myanmar,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5197039/un-facebook-myanmar-rohingya-violence/\">according to the U.N.</url></p><p>These examples are points along a spectrum of uses of your personal information. Finding terrorists using social media should be a good thing. Targeting groups of voters by their age and income levels makes sense if you're trying to effectively use your limited campaign advertising resources.</p><p>Yet now that technology-mediated services have an outsize ability to shape culture at large, the malicious use of this same personal information threatens to undermine every advance made by modern liberal society. This is why I call privacy the last line of defense in the battle for civil liberties.</p><p>Imagine an Uber-like service that used publicly traded information associating your phone number to your race, and used that pairing to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/technology/uber-lyft-racial-discrimination.html\">provide slightly poorer service</url> to African Americans. Or a real estate site that used such data to surreptitiously tailor the house listings presented to you based on your assumed religious or ethnic background. What if ICE quietly bought ads on sites offering immigration assistance to migrants, only to raid and arrest everyone who       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/farmington-university-arrests-ice.html.\">clicked</url> \"I'd like to hire an attorney.\"</p><p>Race, ethnicity, and religion aren't the only types of personal information that can be maliciously exploited. With the utter abandonment of principled politics and the open use of the federal instruments of administration for political aims, profiling has taken on an even more ominous direction.</p><p>There are signs that regulators are catching on. Indeed, after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html\">announcement of a $5 billion dollar fine</url> levied against Facebook, you could be forgiven for thinking \"finally, someone is doing something to protect our privacy.\"</p><p>You'd be wrong. All of the regulations imposed on the major data brokers suffer from one fatal flaw: they reflect a belief that a statutory, regulatory response to this problem can succeed. One might say \"If Facebook violated their terms of use, then we must pass a regulation forbidding them from doing that\" or \"if Amazon's employees have access to Alexa commands, they should stop that practice.\" But none of these proposals fundamentally address when it is permissible to collect personal information and what can be done with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preserving our privacy</emphasis></p><p>If regulation is not enough, how are we to protect our privacy? Thus far, regulations do not clearly address when it's permissible to collect personal information and what can be done with it, and the fines are rarely punitive enough to change behavior. If we think broadly of privacy as a resource to be valued, perhaps we can find some insight on how to protect it.</p><p>Imagine you come to work one day, and find someone has put a nude picture of you on the wall. You quickly have it removed but the embarrassment and anger lingers. Eventually, even that fades - maybe you even move to a new job where no one knows you as \"the naked person.\" Embarrassing, but you recover. For those who have had their personal information stolen, there is no \"but you recover.\" It is impossible to fully remove published information from the digital web. Even if you could miraculously convince every legitimate web service to remove your data, you can never convince those who illicitly deal in personal data to erase it. This immutability of stolen personal data is part of the horror of modern crimes such as revenge porn.</p><p>This is again why an incremental, regulatory based approach to protecting personal information will always fail: because a wound to our digital privacy never heals. We can't wait for a loss, then regulate the circumstances that led to it. By then it is too late. Privacy must be preserved, not conserved; that is why I advocate for a \"preservationist\" approach.</p><p>The preservationist solution is simple and easy to visualize. Imagine a world where we didn't have to figure out how to reign in Facebook. Where creating a set of regulations wasn't something we had to do, but rather Facebook (or Google, or the furniture store down the street) had to figure out how to operate with the principle that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">personal information may not be bought or sold.</emphasis> That is, we preserve our privacy by simply forbidding our personal information from being used as a commodity. Would this eliminate the need for statutes protecting our personal information? No, we'd still want to regulate how and when a service provider could ask for and how they must secure your personal data. But we'd have a principled floor - a bright line not to be crossed - eliminating some of the worst abuses.</p><p>Would this mean the end of Facebook or Google? Of course not. These companies have legions of bright energetic people working for them and they'd quickly adapt. Capitalism, warts and all, is an incredibly effective means of focusing humans on specific problems. Nor does this mean that these companies wouldn't be able to provide services to you. Indeed, with proper assurances on data handling there's nothing to prevent you providing personal information to a company in order for them to provide a service. Google needs my cell phone number so they can route those Google Voice calls to me. But they'd not be permitted to re-use it or sell it.</p><p>With the potential arrival of a new administration in Washington, and new faces in Congress, now is the time for optimism and activism. The potential nightmares of contact tracing, social distance monitoring, and mass testing only increase the urgency of addressing these issues. As citizens we must require candidates to elevate the status of privacy as an issue that differentiates them from the status quo. Privacy is the spine of the body politic. Preventing the sale of our personal information is the only effective tool left to preserve our civil rights as they are assailed by both commercial and governmental bodies. People are not a commodity, and we need to legislate that it is wrong to imbue humans with attributes we reserve for property. It is deeply saddening that we need to call for laws to say: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I am not for sale.</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1592691432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605X-M481-DYTP-R3NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

There was even a White House summit about it last July. Online election \"interference,\" so called, meanwhile seems more likely to get portrayed as something benefiting the right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Either way, the prevailing sentiment seems to be that misinformation that rises to the level of requiring political redress is something that happens primarily online; an Internet phenomenon as opposed to mainstream media one.</p><p>Apart from the President's missives against \"fake news\" at CNN and NBC, we don't see (properly so) the same calls for regulation of mainstream media.</p><p>Neither mainstream nor social media speech should be regulated by government, but the apparent one-sidedness of the \"pass\" for mainstream media has implications for the future of expression if regulators get involved, as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has once again asked that they do.</p><p>For example, Nancy Pelosi got upset about an allegedly doctored and selectively edited video of her height-of-decorum ripping up of the State of the Union Address. While by no means a \"deepfake,\" regulation of such is a rising policy agenda item, and she wanted Twitter and Facebook to remove the video.</p><p>Mainstream media does selective editing every day, as anyone who's ever been quoted or interviewed can tell you.</p><p>Big Media's major institutions like print and broadcast editorial management marinate in left of center perspectives, and this will matter and will pose interesting dynamics for any content regulation like that espoused by Zuckerberg.</p><p>Most U.S. journalists support Democrats and policies deemed \"progressive, as is their right to do. To their left leaning agenda, though, \"misinformation\" can be whatever political viewpoints aren't advancing progressivism and politically correct attitudes.</p><p>Neither political party embodies classical liberal ideals, of course, so this is no cheer for Republicans. But since the Washington Post began endorsing presidential candidates major in 1976 (sitting out 1988) it has never endorsed a Republican; similarly the New York Times has not endorsed one in over 60 years. Broadcast news reactions on election night 2016 were as illustrative of the depth of mainstream journalistic support for a Democratic presidential candidate then, as daily cable news and Sunday morning news talk coverage of current political events is now.</p><p>NPR recently concluded a fundraising campaign (we need your help to raise $6,000 this hour!) complete with testimonials attesting to its \"unbiased reporting.\" Yet there are few, if any, controversies over Trump, nor over social issues, on which its hosts and commentators have not made up their minds, generally in favor of whatever increases a federal government role in society.</p><p>But it's OK for them all to do that.</p><p>It's also OK, I guess, that the first 2019 Democratic presidential debate underscored the pro-big-government progressivism of journalists. No moderator asked candidates, \"What are you going to do to get government out of healthcare?\" That would be a stunner. No; quite the contrary, candidates were actually asked if their plans would extend health care to citizens of foreign countries present in the United States</p><p>\"This is a show of hands question and hold them up so people can see. Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.\"</p><p>All onstage candidates answered in the affirmative; there is video. Republicans long ago were mocked for saying Medicare would lead to domestic socialism and single-payer, effectively turning America's doctors into federal government employees, and in turn reliably left of center voters (\"free\" college, ditto). We somehow arrived in the U.S. to point that media is all-in on non-criticism of socialism. There was no follow-up, \"Are you nuts?\" question.</p><p>Another example of media unity is fatuous, evangelical coverage of a so-called Green New Deal and its financing (the latter may be summed up as follows: When you run out of other people's money, keep spending anyway).</p><p>With one political party is on the verge of nominating one of its socialists, a line has been crossed; a revolution treated as ordinary politics by a saluting media that should have been suspicious and challenging.</p><p>The accusation hurled at social media is that it is overly vulnerable to propaganda and influence.</p><p>But guess what. Media normalization of socialism for the next generation constitutes \"meddling\" in and \"influencing\" elections.</p><p>Of course, newspapers already endorse candidates, something conveniently ignored in the social media election influence demand. The New York Times further bucked tradition to \"influence\" the upcoming election by publishing an anonymous \"resistance\" op-ed from a purported Trump administration insider. Again, it's OK for them to do that.</p><p>But look at your compass; where we are now? Mainstream election \"influence\" is OK, but \"bad\" if social media does it. But it can't be bad because it's something different, because influence is old school. It must therefore be bad because social media can potentially, at least so far, come to future conclusions that threaten mainstream ones.</p><p>If the latter anecdotes do not constitute improper election influence on the part of mainstream media (and they do not), then neither by extension (barring actual hacking and changing votes) are the other trivial-by-comparison things like \"trolling,\" advertisements, or other forms of disfavored attempts to persuade that happen online.</p><p>As for bots that some in this same campaign wish to regulate, their spewage is not misinformation, nor even information at all. Information on which decisions are based needs to be authenticated, just as even scientific knowledge is seen as tentative. Social media never had a golden age of reliability anyway and government cannot spawn one. But then neither did mainstream media have a golden age: As a recent Babylon Bee headline joked, \"CNN to launch real news spinoff site\" Bots are more a technological problem than a policy one.</p><p>Perhaps the deepest illustration of this problem now is that, despite the handwringing at global confabs over \"harm,\" \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation,\" these categories, tellingly, never include online or mainstream media socialist advocacy.</p><p>Despite 20th Century socialism's \"Everest of bodies\" of victims, socialist speech is popular and not under threat by those regulators; that myopia becomes the problem when they start to implement law, policy or guidance.</p><p>In the U.S. at least, such government regulation would stand in violation of constitutional principles of the protection of the unpopular speech or content (although that's not much of a barrier after the Constitution's progressive deconstruction). But global rules will affect speech in the U.S.</p><p>Industrial level non-impartiality even makes the \"third-party,\" \"fact check\" infrastructure suspect, as its function appears to be that of providing cover for liberals in its framing of events and in the choice of what to fact-check or to simply ignore. Given that, big tech's promises to pacify policymakers by relying on fact checkers are more a red flag than palliative.</p><p>\"Manipulated media\" and deep fakes are the new boogerman on social media, and companies like Facebook and Twitter are rightly taking action. Under the heading \"Authenticity\", Twitter posted on February 4 \"Our new rule\":</p><p>You may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide context.\"</p><p>But what does \"likely to cause harm\" mean, given what we know liberals think their authoritarianism is harmless?</p><p>Twitter's policy could be an excellent one, and that company alone should set its own policy. But it appears in context of assorted eruptions at social media firms and suggests to some a liberal bias and non-neutrality. These include accusations of contemplated search result manipulation to counter Trump's travel ban; staff departures and firings allegedly rooted in the holding of unacceptable conservative viewpoints; a controversial dissolution of an artificial intelligence committee after an employee backlash over a conservative foundation head's taking part; and crestfallen tech executives comforting employees with a \"history is on our side\" pep talk in an all-hands meeting after the election of Donald Trump.</p><p>Biases? Undeniable in some instances, less so in others. These are not the core concern.</p><p>The concern is that there are increasing calls, not for self-regulation like Twitter's version, but external regulation of social media (I discussed versions from the right and from the left elsewhere) while leaving conventional media alone.</p><p>Both traditional media and social media should be left alone.</p><p>Bias, misinformation, disinformation and similar subjective criteria become public policy issues only when government seeks to regulate content and speech or decide for us what is \"harmful.\" A brand new example of the kind of censorship to expect is a recent call by a Democrat in Congress for Google's YouTube to remove \"climate disinformation videos.\"</p><p>The up-with-socialism videos are OK, though. Those aren't misinformation or disinformation in need of being added to YouTube's \"borderline content\" roster, you see. (Nor, as should be obvious by now, am I demanding that they should be.)</p><p>Downstream, the administrative state that would carry out any of the various new directives is every bit as left leaning as mainstream media, academia and allegedly the big tech workforce.</p><p>There of course exists no political right not to be offended, nor even to be told the truth, for that matter. Finding that out is each of our jobs.</p><p>While I may point out monolithic thinking, Congress needs to protect it. It needs to preserve the right to express newspeak and groupthink, whether it comes from the right or left, or from conventional or newfangled media. We are or should be permitted to be independent thinkers who not only can but have an obligation to sort it out. If we literally as beings cannot handle misinformation and propaganda, we shouldn't be voting in the first place. And that's preposterous.</p><p>In today's policy climate, mainstream media gets to maintain its biases and proclivities. Will non-conforming social media of the future retain that essential freedom?</p><p>With members of Congress and social media companies alike coming out in favor of content regulation, a decision by mainstream media to pile on too would represent quite the challenge for dissident free speech.</p><p>This thinking out loud on social media has wound up turning into something of a series; here are other very recent \"installments.\"</p><p>Deepfakes And Beyond: Who Wins If Social Media Platforms Are Regulated?</p><p>How Conservatives' Campaign To Impose Political Neutrality Regulation On Big Tech Will Backfire</p><p>How Regulation Of \"Harmful Speech\" Online Will Do The Real Harm</p><p>Big Tech: Arise And Defend Online Bias And Controversial Speech From Aspiring Regulators</p><p>Later we'll take a look at some of the formulations of those who proclaim to be opponents of \"harmful speech,\" and present themselves as appropriate arbiters of what gets seen online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123501500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y80-T1X1-JCBF-S0FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We need a law to take some of it back.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two decades ago, at the dawn of the internet age, in an era before smartphones, before apps, before all manner of devices that monitor everything from your car-hailing practices to your dating preferences, the Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy made a startling claim:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You have zero privacy anyway,\" he said. \"Get over it!\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The in-your-face concept had the benefit of being completely prescient and even an understatement. We are now the most data-generating, most uploaded, most share-crazy humans in the history of the world, which means we are also the most monitored, the most data-chomped and, definitely, the most exposed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column </emphasis>on Twitter<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.]</emphasis></p><p>Our information - much of it private - is the rocket fuel of the ever-expanding internet. Our data keeps it humming along, even as tech companies abuse that data with increasing frequency.</p><p>So here's an idea: Maybe we refuse to get over it. Maybe we start to grok what we have become, and think harder about the trades we are making for the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules - rules that have real teeth - on big tech companies.</p><p>The question, of course, is what those rules should look like. Some argue the United States needs a hefty, multipronged national privacy bill that would include more stringent requirements for how tech giants run their platforms. (Some even think there should be a new agency to oversee the industry.) Others think that current law will suffice, with some tweaking including better enforcement and more money for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector, like the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>I would argue that we need both, and fast, before these data-hungry tech companies become even more enmeshed in our lives. Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company's top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don't. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don't. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you.</p><p>I have said yes too many times before, thanks to the greatest tracking effort in the history of humanity that we facilitate every day by using a smartphone.</p><p>Let me be clear - I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now. But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously. </p><p>You don't have to be paranoid to realize that you are being followed, watched and crunched in ways that are breathtaking, and more than a little questionable. We need a national law to signal to these companies that the jig is up and that they need to stop abrogating their responsibilities to their users and to society itself - and I think it's pretty inevitable we'll get one in the next few years.</p><p>At the same time, we don't want to impose undue burdens on new start-ups or throttle innovation. That's why I think it would be a mistake to overreact and crack down too hard, as Europe has done in some instances. </p><p>Europe has put in place strict laws like the General Data Protection Regulation of 2018, the most significant change in privacy law in decades. It gives a lot of power to individuals over how their personal data is collected and used, and is much more punitive when it comes to data breaches. </p><p>There are also ePrivacy rules there that govern how people can be targeted by advertisers. Some regulations, like the exceedingly complex \"right to be forgotten,\" would slam right into free speech laws here in the United States. This week, for example, Britain proposed creating a far-reaching regulator to punish tech companies, including their individual executives, for damaging content on their platforms.</p><p>Europe's message to big tech is increasingly clear: You made this mess, so you clean it up, or else.</p><p>This punitiveand suspicious sentiment had already jumped the Atlantic - all the way across to the Pacific - with California passing its Consumer Privacy Act last year. Less stringent than the General Data Protection Regulation (and criticized by some for being too soft), it makes California-based companies follow stronger data protection rules, including giving the state's consumers more insight and power over how their data is used and imposing fines when tech platforms don't comply. The law will go into effect in 2020, and there may be further additions to it. </p><p>There are also privacy bills in play in at least 10 other states, so we are off and running to a confusing patchwork of laws. We need a more unified approach, because right now, our privacy regulation looks like a goat rodeo.</p><p>We have to figure this out now, because more privacy-threatening technologies - such as artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, automation, robotics, self-driving cars and above all, facial recognition - are all part of the next wave of innovation. How the tech giants share data with  one another will also be an issue, because the ecosystem is increasingly intertwined.</p><p>There are some countries that have gone far beyond what Americans would be comfortable with, China being the most aggressive. Beijing has created a surveillance economy that makes our current privacy issues seem trivial. The last thing we want is to get into a race over which country can better stalk its citizens. But we also need to ensure that the version of the internet that was invented in the United States - one based on a principle of openness - is the one that should prevail.</p><p>Given how much is headed our way, I called Mr. McNealy to ask him if he  felt the same about privacy now as he did in 1999.</p><p>He said the harvesting of data wasunlikely to get any less invasive and noted that the information that is collected about us is like a \"digital tattoo\" that is impossible to expunge. Nonetheless, Mr. McNealy is not a fan of government regulation. He said that a federal privacy law would be a mistake because it would hinder innovation, and cautioned that the costs of compliance would hurt small companies.</p><p>He also said that there are still enough alternatives to allow consumers to escape being hostages of Google or Facebook or Amazon, and that if people are concerned about those companies' data collection, they are free to stop using their platforms. </p><p>\"There is nothing to be done about it but consumer choice,\" he said.</p><p>Besides, Mr. McNealy said, much of the data that is being collected is not actually that dangerous. \"Amazon knows that I buy toilet paper, but who cares if it is data that does not matter?\" he asked.</p><p>But at some point, I argued, it does matter. What happens if these companies go too far, and who is to decide how that data is meshed and mixed with other data? Mr. McNealy insisted that current laws, bolstered by antitrust action, should remedy any abuses.</p><p>\"There are plenty of laws to deal with it if, say, Google is reading my email\" without permission, he said. \"And if these companies do abuse their power by advantaging other parts of their businesses, then regulators ought to have long, hard conversation with them.\" </p><p>Until then, according to the Cassandra of privacy? \"I can live without Google, so it does not bother me,\" he said.</p><p>In other words, get over it? I don't intend to, and I don't think anyone else should, either. While we may have zero privacy, it doesn't mean that we have given up our right to control our digital selves.

We need a law to take some of it back.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two decades ago, at the dawn of the internet age, in an era before smartphones, before apps, before all manner of devices that monitor everything from your car-hailing practices to your dating preferences, the Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy made a startling claim:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cYou have zero privacy anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cGet over it!\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The in-your-face concept had the benefit of being completely prescient and even an understatement. We are now the most data-generating, most uploaded, most share-crazy humans in the history of the world, which means we are also the most monitored, the most data-chomped and, definitely, the most exposed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1116757522088517632\">on Twitter</url>.]</p><p>Our information \u2014 much of it private \u2014 is the rocket fuel of the ever-expanding internet. Our data keeps it humming along, even as tech companies abuse that data with increasing frequency.</p><p>So here\u2019s an idea: Maybe we refuse to get over it. Maybe we start to grok what we have become, and think harder about the trades we are making for the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules \u2014 rules that have real teeth \u2014 on big tech companies.</p><p>The question, of course, is what those rules should look like. Some argue the United States needs a hefty, multipronged national privacy bill that would include more stringent requirements for how tech giants run their platforms. (Some even think there should be a new agency to oversee the industry.) Others think that current law will suffice, with some tweaking including better enforcement and more money for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector, like the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>I would argue that we need both, and fast, before these data-hungry tech companies become even more enmeshed in our lives. Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company\u2019s top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don\u2019t. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don\u2019t. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you.</p><p>I have said yes too many times before, thanks to the greatest tracking effort in the history of humanity that we facilitate every day by using a smartphone.</p><p>Let me be clear \u2014 I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now. But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously. </p><p>You don\u2019t have to be paranoid to realize that you are being followed, watched and crunched in ways that are breathtaking, and more than a little questionable. We need a national law to signal to these companies that the jig is up and that they need to stop abrogating their responsibilities to their users and to society itself \u2014 and I think it\u2019s pretty inevitable we\u2019ll get one in the next few years.</p><p>At the same time, we don\u2019t want to impose undue burdens on new start-ups or throttle innovation. That\u2019s why I think it would be a mistake to overreact and crack down too hard, as Europe has done in some instances. </p><p>Europe has put in place strict laws like the General Data Protection Regulation of 2018, the most significant change in privacy law in decades. It gives a lot of power to individuals over how their personal data is collected and used, and is much more punitive when it comes to data breaches. </p><p>There are also ePrivacy rules there that govern how people can be targeted by advertisers. Some regulations, like the exceedingly complex \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d would slam right into free speech laws here in the United States. This week, for example, Britain proposed creating a far-reaching regulator <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/business/britain-internet-regulations.html\">to punish tech companies</url>, including their individual executives, for damaging content on their platforms.</p><p>Europe\u2019s message to big tech is increasingly clear: You made this mess, so you clean it up, or else.</p><p>This punitive and suspicious sentiment had already jumped the Atlantic \u2014 all the way across to the Pacific \u2014 with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/technology/california-online-privacy-law.html\">California passing its Consumer Privacy Act</url> last year. Less stringent than the General Data Protection Regulation (and criticized by some for being too soft), it makes California-based companies follow stronger data protection rules, including giving the state\u2019s consumers more insight and power over how their data is used and imposing fines when tech platforms don\u2019t comply. The law will go into effect in 2020, and there may be further additions to it. </p><p>There are also privacy bills in play in at least 10 other states, so we are off and running to a confusing patchwork of laws. We need a more unified approach, because right now, our privacy regulation looks like a goat rodeo.</p><p>We have to figure this out now, because more privacy-threatening technologies \u2014 such as artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, automation, robotics, self-driving cars and above all, facial recognition \u2014 are all part of the next wave of innovation. How the tech giants share data with  one another will also be an issue, because the ecosystem is increasingly intertwined.</p><p>There are some countries that have gone far beyond what Americans would be comfortable with, China being the most aggressive. Beijing has created a surveillance economy that makes our current privacy issues seem trivial. The last thing we want is to get into a race over which country can better stalk its citizens. But we also need to ensure that the version of the internet that was invented in the United States \u2014 one based on a principle of openness \u2014 is the one that should prevail.</p><p>Given how much is headed our way, I called Mr. McNealy to ask him if he  felt the same about privacy now as he did in 1999.</p><p>He said the harvesting of data was unlikely to get any less invasive and noted that the information that is collected about us is like a \u201cdigital tattoo\u201d that is impossible to expunge. Nonetheless, Mr. McNealy is not a fan of government regulation. He said that a federal privacy law would be a mistake because it would hinder innovation, and cautioned that the costs of compliance would hurt small companies.</p><p>He also said that there are still enough alternatives to allow consumers to escape being hostages of Google or Facebook or Amazon, and that if people are concerned about those companies\u2019 data collection, they are free to stop using their platforms. </p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to be done about it but consumer choice,\u201d he said.</p><p>Besides, Mr. McNealy said, much of the data that is being collected is not actually that dangerous. \u201cAmazon knows that I buy toilet paper, but who cares if it is data that does not matter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>But at some point, I argued, it does matter. What happens if these companies go too far, and who is to decide how that data is meshed and mixed with other data? Mr. McNealy insisted that current laws, bolstered by antitrust action, should remedy any abuses.</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of laws to deal with it if, say, Google is reading my email\u201d without permission, he said. \u201cAnd if these companies do abuse their power by advantaging other parts of their businesses, then regulators ought to have long, hard conversation with them.\u201d </p><p>Until then, according to the Cassandra of privacy? \u201cI can live without Google, so it does not bother me,\u201d he said.</p><p>In other words, get over it? I don\u2019t intend to, and I don\u2019t think anyone else should, either. While we may have zero privacy, it doesn\u2019t mean that we have given up our right to control our digital selves. In fact, as tech marches on, that might be the one right that needs to be protected most of all.</p><p>Follow <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/privacyproject\">@privacyproject</url> on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</url> and      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/nytopinion/\">Instagram</url>.</p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Max Loeffler FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000006452327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVR-FVR1-DXY4-X2TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1292\"/><timeReceived>17:04 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp;

Opposite them was the top brass of the Obama administration, including President Obama himself. It was a few days before Christmas 2013. The tech execs had come to convince the government to roll back its mass surveillance regime that had recently been revealed thanks to a whistleblower named Edward Snowden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two sides, tech and government, went back and forth, civil but tense. At one point, Obama said that as angry and concerned as Americans were about the NSA's practices, the tech companies in the room collected far more information on people than the government did. \"I have a suspicion,\" Obama told the executives, \"that the guns will turn.\"</p><p>That eerily prescient moment is told for the first time in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Weapons-Promise-Peril-Digital/dp/1984877712\">Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age</url>, a new book by Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, and coauthor Carol Ann Browne, a member of Smith's team. A long-time adviser to Bill Gates, Smith leads a huge swath of Microsoft but is also a public conscience of sorts for the grow-at-all-costs tech sector. He consults with presidents, foreign officials, and fellow tech leaders; the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/technology/microsofts-top-lawyer-is-the-tech-worlds-envoy.html\">dubbed him</url> \"a de facto ambassador for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/t/technology/\">technology</url> industry at large.\" Smith was in the Roosevelt Room in 2013, and he has been a driving force behind Microsoft's lawsuits against the Obama and Trump administrations as well as its efforts to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.christchurchcall.com/\">unite</url> tech giants, governments, and nonprofit groups to combat terrorist and extremist content online.</p><p>Smith's book is not the typical vanity project churned out by so many Fortune 500 leaders, the generic tomes on leadership and teamwork stocked at airport bookstores near the neck pillows. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tools and Weapons</emphasis> is a glimpse behind the curtain as Microsoft reckoned with the Snowden revelations, defended against the vicious cyberattacks, and took both the Obama and Trump administrations to court. Smith also doesn't shy away from taking Big Tech to task.</p><p>Smith recently spoke with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rolling Stone</emphasis> at Microsoft's offices in Times Square. We discussed breaking up Big Tech, why the Cambridge Analytica scandal was the Three-Mile Island of the tech sector, and what a digital September 11th attack on the U.S. could look like. \"We are not yet prepared either to fully prevent such an attack,\" he says, \"or to know how we would respond as a nation if it happened.\" The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The first story you tell in</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tools and Weapons</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">is about the Snowden leak in 2013. From that day to today, it feels like the major technology-driven events have skewed more toward peril than promise. Russian active measures, the Equifax hack in 2017, Cambridge Analytica in 2018, the Christchurch attacks in 2019. Are we at a crossroads, an inflection point, in how we think about technology and how it shapes our lives?</emphasis>It is fair to say we have reached a crossroads. We reached it last year when the Cambridge Analytica issue exploded. For years, there had been a debate within the tech sector about privacy and whether people actually cared about it. One school of thought said that privacy was dead and people should get over it, and another school said that that was not the case.</p><p>I have long felt that the tech sector ran the risk of following in the footsteps of the nuclear power industry in the United States. It was so enthusiastic about the good things it was creating that it wasn't preparing itself or the public for a broader conversation about potential privacy challenges. Cambridge Analytica was a bit of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/three-mile-island-accident.aspx\">Three Mile Island moment</url>. Suddenly, attitudes changed in Washington D.C., and it's as if we hit a fork in the road, went down a different path, and things like the Christchurch attack accelerated the progress down that path.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Three Mile Island comparison is a powerful one. You think that Cambridge Analytica is something we're going to continue to talk about for years to come?</emphasis>We may or may not talk about Cambridge Analytica specifically, but there was the nature of the conversation in the United States before Cambridge Analytica; it is a different conversation today. I don't think there's any going back to what existed before. Just in the same way that I don't think one can go back to pre-Snowden times when it comes to government-accessed information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York Times</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">once described you as a \"de facto ambassador for the tech industry at large.\" Was that something that you set out to do, or tripped into along the way?</emphasis>I was first pressed into service, if you will, when I was fortunate to become Microsoft's general counsel in 2002. My first mission was to make peace with governments across the world, and to build bridges across the technology sector. It was all about trying to find a more stable path for Microsoft on our antitrust issues.\u00a0</p><p>The Snowden events were an inflection point for many people across the tech sector, certainly including me. But they also pressed us into a more adversarial relationship with our government. It was a real rubicon to cross to file a lawsuit against the United States government. It was especially a rubicon for somebody like me who had spent a decade making peace and ending lawsuits to now be the one who was initiating them. In the years since we sued the Obama administration four times over surveillance issues. We've sued the Trump administration over immigration. And yet we need to work with government at the same time.</p><p>There are days when we get up and the world changes. For Microsoft, one day was when the Department of Justice sued the company in the late 1990s. Certainly, one day was when Edward Snowden decided to share documents, including information that even <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">we</emphasis> were not aware of. Another day was the election of Donald Trump.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Did you see a space there that needed to be filled?</emphasis>We saw spaces that needed to be filled, but we have seldom ever wanted to fill spaces by ourselves. I will say we, like everyone, have had certain learning moments over time. Interestingly enough, one key learning moment was on a different issue in 2012. It was the year the Washington state legislature was debating marriage equality. We decided we wanted to speak out. We also decided we didn't want to speak out by ourselves. We said we would speak out if we could get four other companies to speak with us.\u00a0</p><p>With the deadline to speak only 48 hours away, there was only one other company that was prepared to speak. I remember making the decision that come hell or high water, we would go forward, even if it meant going almost alone. And what we learned is once we said we would go, others found more courage as well. By the time 48 hours had passed, we had five companies, but what I'll always remember is, a week later after we went, Amazon and Starbucks joined us.\u00a0</p><p>That is a lasting lesson. In order to lead, others have to follow. Ideally, you'd all like to take the first step together, but sometimes you have to be prepared to go at it alone.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You talk a lot about that in the book - collaboration, cooperation. How do you balance that work when it's suing the federal government? When it involves privacy and surveillance, I see that connection pretty clearly. What about when it's over immigration policy?</emphasis>We felt there was also a close connection to issues that are fundamental to our business. Just as I think a company like ours should protect customers first, in many ways we have to protect our employees second. The industry is so fast changing that, in truth, we're only as good as the next product as distinct from the product we finished yesterday. Our next product is only as good as our employees can make it.</p><p>We have employees from around the world, even in the United States. We will stand up for our employees, and we will protect them. When the White House rescinded DACA and put literally the freedom of Dreamers at risk, that changed the potential future course of dozens of Microsoft employees who are Dreamers. The most emphatic statement that we made was when I said that if the federal government wanted to deport any of our employees, they would have to go through us.\u00a0</p><p>That was a decision that we made quickly. It was not a hard decision. We felt as a matter of principle that these individuals were, for the most part, as American as anyone else. They're people that deserve protection, and our business requires that we stand up for the people who bet their jobs, and in some cases their careers, on our company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In a chapter on cybersecurity you write, \"In a world where everything is connected, anything can be disrupted.\" You go on to mention the idea of a digital 9/11. What would that look like? Are we prepared for it?</emphasis>I don't think we're prepared for the kind of digital 9/11 that the world could confront. Especially because a digital 9/11 could take many different forms. One form of a digital 9/11 for the United States, or any democracy, would be to find the day after an election that we have no confidence in the tabulation of the votes because they were distorted by the interference of a foreign government. We are not yet prepared either to fully prevent such an attack or to know how we would respond as a nation if it happened.</p><p>The best way to envision this is to understand what happened in Ukraine when the Russians unleashed the NotPetya attack against that nation. Banks stopped working; people could not get cash out of ATMs. They couldn't use their credit card at the grocery store because the grocery store registers stopped working. They couldn't buy gas for their cars because they had no way to pay for it. In the worst case you can imagine the electricity going off, the heat being lost in the middle of winter, and hospitals stop working. That was a real-life issue as we share in the story about what happened at St. Bartholomew's hospital in London as a result of WannaCry.</p><p>If you want to just look ahead a decade or more, in some ways I think an ultimate digital 9/11 is a government or some other nefarious actor hacking their way and destructing autonomous vehicles. What does it mean when cars are going 60 miles per hour down the highway, controlled by computers, and then someone else takes control of those systems?</p><p>We believe emphatically that the public is not yet fully alert to these issues. Until we have an informed public, I think the danger of a digital 9/11 will continue to increase.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There's an idea in the book that comes up in the book through the voice of</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/technology/denmark-tech-ambassador.html\">Denmark's first-ever tech ambassador</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">, which is the idea of the world's largest tech companies as nation-states basically. Do you agree with that?</emphasis>I mostly don't like the comparison. I believe companies should be regulated by governments and not ever be considered equals to them. I believe that one of the fundamental tenets of American history is that no one is above the law. That means that no individual, government, company, or technology is, or should be, above the law.\u00a0</p><p>There is something distinctive about the role of technology companies that create the opportunity for us to hopefully contribute to new solutions in new ways. Technology is global. Technology companies are global. Cyberspace, unlike land, water, and air, is constructed and operated by the private sector. We have arguably a unique role to play in addressing these issues. The 21st century requires a new era of not just multilateral, but multi-stakeholder initiatives. We need to bring governments, companies, and nonprofits together, because we can do so much more together than we'll ever accomplish if we're all separate or apart.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Something stuck out to me in the beginning and end of the book. It's in Bill Gates' introduction, and it's a point you make in the book's conclusion. You write, \"Microsoft was in the hot seat two decades ago. We recognize that we needed to change. I took from our battles three lessons that we continue to learn from and apply,\" and you go on to describe what those lessons are. The hot seat is Microsoft's antitrust battle. Does it only take a similar experience for any of the other of the world's largest tech companies to make the sort of changes that you and everyone at Microsoft have?</emphasis>Many things helped force Microsoft to change beginning in the late 1990s. But most fundamentally, the collection of pressures from the government and the media - and it really was both - forced us to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as other people saw us.\u00a0</p><p>We were forced to see what other people saw in us. Once we saw that, we could appreciate in a better way that there were impacts that we were having that were affecting others in a manner that we didn't necessarily intend or anticipate or even understand. That was the first step in what really was a multi-year journey to find a new way of working with everyone else.</p><p>I think the entire tech sector needs to go on something like that journey. That's the only way across the industry we're all come to appreciate the various needs and opportunities to change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you think that moment of recognition, that kind of reckoning of sorts, needs to be a more updated, revamped, aggressive antitrust policy?</emphasis>Any time you want someone to slow down, you engage in the proverbial warning shot across the bow. And if someone heeds the warning shot, you don't need to fire again. And if they fail to heed the warning, then clearly more and stronger steps will be needed. The question for all of us in the technology sector is whether we're listening sufficiently to the warning shots that are now being fired by many governments and many other people around the world.\u00a0</p><p>On the positive side, I would say, that in some critical respects, the answer is yes. You hear people talking about the importance of regulation in ways that were unheard of in the tech sector just 24 months ago. On the negative side, until people go beyond talking about this as a generality and roll up their sleeves with some thoughts about what it may mean specifically, it's not yet clear that we are where we'll need to go.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If tech companies are the ships in this metaphor, what happens if you get so large that the shot across the bow becomes a pea shooter?</emphasis>I don't think companies tend to become too big to be beyond the reach of regulation. People can become too hard-headed to listen and, often times, when governments feel compelled to bring the toughest of antitrust cases, it is because the company is big and the individuals are pretty darn hardheaded. I personally am not an advocate for breaking up companies in part because I think it tends to be a very long process that is less impactful than many other approaches for solving a problem.</p><p>Having lived through it ourselves, it was a wake-up call that we heeded. It's not wise to force people to feel they have no alternative but to break you up. You're much better off listening before then. You're better off figuring out how to solve the problems that are bothering people. You should learn from our experience that life does go on, and that nobody ever died of humility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy, the size of major tech companies, and antitrust are having a moment in the Democratic presidential primary. What do you see in what these candidates are saying that you think is on the right or the wrong track?</emphasis>It is unusual, and even ironic, to see so much populism in the world at a time when macro-economically, we have had almost a decade of growth. Most of the time, you see populism rise economies fall. The first thing we have to do is ask: What is going on and why is this happening? The answer, fundamentally, is that some people are moving forward while other very large and important groups of people feel left behind.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inequality.</emphasis>Yes. But what is most interesting about the present moment is we're seeing populism on both sides of the political aisle. In the United States, we're seeing populism fuel the Republican Party, in part based on rural communities that feel left behind. We can go to major cities like New York and San Francisco and Seattle where left-wing populism is very strong. We're seeing the people who have traditionally lived in those communities being pushed out. That, too, has a technology root.</p><p>What do we do? My fear is that we will fail to understand the technology forces as fully as we should. That's why we spend time in the book talking about what it's like to see the inside of a data center, because only when you see the inside of a data center do you understand how these technology forces work. It's why we take readers on a trip to Ferry County in the little town of Republic, Washington, so they can see for themselves what it's like when other people don't have access to what those in major cities take for granted every day. It's why we tell the story about the affordable housing issues in Seattle and how they evolved.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You ask in the book, \"If technology continues to advance, can the world control the future it's creating?\" What are the fundamental elements of trying to control that future technology is creating?</emphasis>It is one of the most important questions for our country and every country for the next decade. We do analogize explicitly in the book to the 1930s. Albert Einstein captured, in such a prescient way, the huge problems that were arising with the maturation of the machine age. He said that the organizing power of mankind needed to keep pace with humanity's ability to keep moving technology forward. And as history showed, it failed, and tens of millions of people paid the price.</p><p>We're not here to say that we're on the horizons of approaching World War III, but the same question applies today. Do we have the will and determination to do what needs to be done? Second, let's appreciate the 21st-century tools we have to address these problems. Namely, we can move ourselves forward as an industry to be creative and effective in new ways. Let's also push governments, and help governments move faster so they can catch up with the pace of innovation. Let's then build on multi-stakeholder opportunities that didn't really exist, in a significant way a century ago like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.christchurchcall.com/\">Christchurch call</url> and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber-security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in\">Paris call</url> so we bring governments, companies, and nonprofits together.</p><p>Cultural change is needed for us as an industry. At an even more fundamental level, cultural change is needed for us as a broader community of people in this country and in other countries. We can't just spend year after year arguing with each other. We've got to build the coalitions of the willing, and we can't stop based on our daily shortcomings and winning support from everybody, because we will have those shortcomings every day. But if we start strong, move forward, and just persist through sheer determination, there's at least a path.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RLNGST-881314</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RLNGST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X12-0GV1-DYJW-X4VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468655</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Rolling Stone</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1921\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Kantayya builds a far-ranging examination of automated decision-making tools already deployed in our institutions and illuminates the threat to civil liberties across the globe, from an apartment complex in Brooklyn to the streets of London to government-sponsored surveillance in China.An official selection at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Coded Bias has been compared to An Inconvenient Truth in breaking down the diffuse issues of surveillance, data mining, and machine learning. Variety[2] calls Coded Bias both a 'wake-up call' and 'a call to action,' and The Hollywood Reporter[3] hails it as 'a chilling plunge into Orwellian reality.' The film releases nationally in November.Kantayya spoke with me via Zoom about the making of the film, why algorithmic justice is an urgent civil rights issue, and how AI can become more just.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. </p><p>Reena Shah: I understand that you love tech and also are attracted to how tech influences inequality. How did these two impulses influence Coded Bias?Shalini Kantayya: I'm a science fiction fanatic, I love imagining the future of tech, and tech is part of my practice as an artist and my fascination as a human being. All of my work has to do with how disruptive technologies impact equality and whether they make the world more or less fair for marginalized communities, including people of color and women. My first film [A Drop of Life] is based on a true story about a woman who puts a prepaid system on a village water pump in India, so you can only get water with a prepaid card. And Catching the Sun is about how small-scale residential solar can uplift the working class and the economic and innovation opportunities in building a clean-energy economy. With Coded Bias, I discovered the work of two of the women in my film, Joy Buolamwini and Cathy O'Neil, the author of Weapons of Math Destruction, and fell down the rabbit hole of the dark underbelly of Big Tech.RS: The film begins with Joy Buolamwini's discovery about facial recognition technology and then quickly, and startlingly, expands into a broad range of surveillance technology and automated systems in our daily lives. Was that your intent?SK: I definitely did not know that narrative before I started. What I discovered was Joy Buolamwini, who was trying to make an art project work by making a Snapchat filter recognize her face. She stumbled upon this crazy thing: that facial recognition, already deployed widely and to a large part secretly, without an elected official approving it, had serious racial and gender biases. Through Joy's story, I follow how automated systems have become invisible gatekeepers of opportunity, deciding who gets health care, who gets hired, who gets into universities, who gets parole, who shows up on your feed.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[4]Facial recognition is in some ways the easiest algorithm to understand because it's so invasive and because of surveillance cameras. But I think with the research of so many brilliant and badass women in my film, the story is able to approach more invisible, opaque algorithms.RS: What were some of the challenges in making the issue of bias in tech come alive for the general public?SK: Well, I couldn't talk to people for two years. I'd go to a party and someone would ask, what are you doing, and I'd say, 'I'm making a film about how robots are racist and sexist.' It was really hard to explain. There are seven Ph.D.s in the film. I was talking to so many smart women and trying to figure out how to weave the story together.What I learned in the making of Coded Bias was that data rights really intersect with human rights and civil rights. What I'm trying to do in the film is bridge a gap in scientific understanding. We see with COVID-19 that understanding, translating, and acting on science are really important to civic engagement. I feel that the geniuses in my film, like Joy, do a really good job of showing why the science matters and to whom it matters most.RS: What was the moment, in making this film, when you felt most concerned, and perhaps most overwhelmed, as a citizen?SK: First, I'm not just saying this, but I do feel a tremendous amount of hope. I watched the research of Joy Buolamwini to Ravi Naik [human rights lawyer] to Deborah Raji [tech fellow at the AI Now Institute at New York University] change the world. In June, IBM said that they would get out of the game, stop researching, deploying, and selling facial recognition. Microsoft said it would stop selling to police, and Amazon said it would take a one-year pause. Of all the outcomes that I imagined at the beginning of the journey, I never expected this kind of sea change. Perhaps it's only a gesture, but I do feel that we have a moon shot moment to shape these technologies of the future.Right now, all of the power is on one side and that's not healthy for democracy. For instance, if you go to a protest and police take a picture and load it into a system and pull up your whole social media profile, do you have freedom of assembly? If you post something on an algorithm that's criticizing Facebook, and Facebook places it on the bottom of their feed, do you have freedom of speech? There are so many things that we haven't thought about because we lack a basic understanding of how these systems work. What's most alarming for me is how widely these systems are already being deployed. We're outsourcing our decision-making to machines that have biases that can hurt people and have real consequences for people's lives. If the public knows more, we can put pressure on Big Tech to do the right thing. The technology is still wet, like the cement is still wet, and we can still imprint our values on these tools. But we need balance and we need laws. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[5]RS: There are several organizations, including the Algorithmic Justice League, pushing for a kind of FDA of tech, a regulatory body.SK: I saw essentially three approaches [by governments] to data. There's China, which is like a Black Mirror episode inside the film in which surveillance is literally part of grocery store purchases and vending machines. There are the Europeans, who have a framework around data rights being human rights.Then we have the U.S., which is a Wild West. Here, tech is not regulated like other sectors of society. I'm hopeful that we'll start to question, like Cathy O'Neil says, 'the blind faith that we have in big data' and that we can enact a balance of power and advocate as citizens to protect our civil rights.I saw in the making of my film a 14-year-old Black British boy in school uniform wrongly identified by the police. There's a particular danger when these racial biases are weaponized with the power of the state. When Joy spoke to Congress in 2019, Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said, wait a minute, 117 million Americans are in a police database and no one in elected office made a decision on that? That's a cause for alarm, and he looked as terrified as the Democrats.I think the current sea change owes a debt of gratitude to the people in the streets. That movement has changed how people view systems of oppression and systematic racism and sexism. In June, we got the first-ever legislation on the table that would ban federal use of facial recognition. Hopefully, it's the beginning of a conversation. I'm hoping the film offers a way to talk about these issues and connect them to the things that people care about. As we peel back the curtain on the Wizard of Oz, on Big Tech, we can see it for what it is. It's made by flawed people coding their own biases into these algorithms. Knowing this can change the way we think about technology.RS: In the film, a young woman in China discusses the benefits of surveillance and the social order it helps her make sense of. It's a scary moment. How does this compare to the U.S.?SK: She loves Big Brother! And we all do a little bit. People [in the U.S.] talk about that idea like it's far away. But how many times have you looked at someone's Twitter or Instagram followers or Facebook likes and made a judgment about them? We are all being scored all the time in different ways. We are engaging in what Cathy [O'Neil] calls algorithmic obedience training. We're all being trained to be obedient based on our score.The reason for the scene in China is to illustrate that we have no protection against that happening in the United States. We don't have laws that would prevent large-scale, invasive surveillance, either by a state or corporation.RS: How does our love affair with efficiency and convenience play a role? Are human rights and civil rights being trampled in the name of ease and automation?SK: For me, that's a Gattaca-esque future. Really we are more than our past data. We become the first people to go to college. We become larger than the sum total of our parts. But the race to efficiency denies our humanity.I was especially happy to have Coded Bias screened at the New YorkHuman Rights Watch Film Festival in the context of human rights. The current protests are a process of fighting for the inherent value of every human being, including Black life and inalienable rights. We're learning that we only have as many rights as the most vulnerable among us. Like COVID taught us, we are only as healthy as the most vulnerable among us. We're being asked to build a more humane culture. But the race to efficiency that is making a few people very rich is undermining this. Efficiency culture and greed are working against building a human rights culture.RS: The film brings up great questions about the purpose of technology and AI. Are these technologies helping us?SK: Well, this is the only way we can talk right now. The only way we can be together. So I'm grateful for it. But I think tech can work in ways that serve us better. I don't think that efficiency should always be the goal. And the power of tech needs to be kept in check, like it might have to pay some taxes and obey laws. Respect small business, human rights, let people unionize.We need tech to uphold democratic values as more of our lives go into a virtual public square. We can't opt out of these systems. Increasingly, this is our way of communicating. There should be some [clarity] of what we're consenting to in terms of how our data is used. We should all be suspicious when Google and Apple get together and say, we're going to solve COVID by tracking everyone and we just need to know where you've been and who you've been with. We should all be suspicious when Google and Apple have the kind of data that makes the East German Stasi look like it had a light touch.RS: There's a moment in the film when Cathy O'Neil talks about the 'black box' of these algorithms and that bias gets ingrained into these technologies as a feedback loop. Are the people creating these technologies unaware of these biases?SK: I think a lot of times the biases are unintentional. And that data can be passed into the wrong hands and used in a predatory way. In the example of Amazon, they were trying to hire people and make a system that was fairer, and unknowingly the algorithm discriminated against anyone who had a women's sport or college on their resume, because of who had been successful in the past. So unwittingly the data was predicting the future.I think the tech industry knows this issue exists and wants to fix it. But Silicon Valley wasn't the main audience for my film because I don't think it should be up to them. As long as it's up to big tech companies, we're doing something wrong.RS: It seems that AI needs humans.SK: AI needs diverse humans. AI needs women. AI needs to be inclusive. Fourteen percent of AI researchers are women. I couldn't even find stats on people of color. That's really inexcusable. We have to find out what's going on in terms of that pipeline. Inclusion makes technologies more innovative and it's critical for technologies being deployed to everyone.Technology is a reflection of ourselves. It reflects our human bias. The process of checking for bias is something we have to do continually. It's like the conversation about inclusion. It has to happen all the time, and it makes us healthier and more competitive and humane.

Looking back at 2019 and forward to 2020, Verdict heard from some of those at the heart of the financial industry on how the future of open banking can benefit fintechs, banks and consumers. Obstacles created through missed deadlinesAlthough the PSD2 directive - a regulation designed to allow third parties to access customer data through application programming interfaces (APIs) and also bring in stricter security to reduce fraud - first came into force in 2018, 2019 has seen several key deadlines in its implementation. Banks had until March 2019 to establish a \"sandbox\" environment that third party providers could access and use to test products. However, according to open banking platform Tink, 41% of the 442 European banks surveyed failed to meet the deadline. </p><p>They had until June this year to make their production APIs available to third parties to help them build services for consumers. However, Tink found that none of the 69% of European banks who complied by the deadline provided APIs \"of sufficient quality to have met the required regulatory standards for integration\". The second deadline was for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). This regulation is designed to better protect consumers against fraud by requiring banks to ask for three layers of authentication, such as PIN codes or biometrics, before a payment can be made. Although the original deadline was in September, banks were given an 18-month extension. This failure to meet key PSD2 deadlines demonstrates the challenges that the introduction of open banking has faced, with many criticising banks for not being proactive enough in meeting deadlines, threatening to stifle innovation. Ralf Ohlhausen, executive advisor and European TPP Association vice-chairman believes that progress has been slow due to banks only complying with minimum requirements. Speaking at a roundtable hosted by PPRO he said: \"We spent all of 2018 negotiating with the banks about, what is the right requirements...The banks, surprise, surprise, implemented all those which were explicitly required and they had to do, and they did not implement any one of those which were not explicitly legally required. Now, in our mind, they're still legally required, because their absence creates obstacles, which is also another clause in the RTS.\" The groundwork needs to be completed before the innovation can startAccording to The State of Open Banking 2019, a report published earlier this year by 24% of banks and 29% of fintechs confirmed that they are ready to comply with PSD2. Jack Wilson, head of policy and regulatory affairs at TrueLayer, believes that this has stalled innovation in the fintech sphere: \u00a0\"Leaning on what I could see from my regulatory position, the FCA had 90 plus firms come through its registration process to become third party providers, so you could see this excitement around the opportunities of PSD2 and they're all there ready to make a play, especially in the data space, but then you've got this kind of lurch because there's so much movement needed to be done by the banks to actually roll out the infrastructure that these TPPs can use... it's not available because that bank hasn't yet connected into the infrastructure. So, there's the willingness and the excitement and the start of the innovation but the groundwork needs to be completed before the innovation can start whirring really quickly.\" \"We're still very much at the early offset\"Looking to 2020, what can be done to correct some of the shortcomings of 2019, and ensure that innovation is not stifled? According to research by PWC and the Open Data Institute only 18% of consumers are currently aware of how open banking could affect them, but this is expected to increase significantly to 64% by 2022. James Booth, head of partnerships for Europe and Eastern Africa at financial institution PPRO, believes that although open banking has potential, it has not yet lived up to it, partially due to a lack of widespread awareness: \"I still believe there's a lot of potential in open banking and where we're taking it, but we're still very much at the early offset, we're still debating about how it's going to look, how a lot of it is going to take to market. From my point of view we're only 50% there because there's a whole going to market plan, there's the whole branding side of it from specific partners, there's no consumer interest in any of these products because as mentioned the majority of the consumers don't know about open banking, they don't know about any of the benefits. And without the consumer side demanding some of these products it's going to be very hard to get uptake and get any attraction behind it.\" Ohlhausen believes that greater education is needed, with fears over data sharing deterring some consumers from fully engaging with open banking: \"I think people are more scared about sharing their transaction and banking data than they are about sharing their medical data, when asked the direct question, do you want to share your data. But, if it's packaged up in, do you want this product, this is what you need to do to get it, it would be a completely different question.\" \"You need to incentivise the banks\"As well as educating consumers about how open banking could help them unlock new financial services and manage their money in a more innovative way, it is also important to educate financial incumbents on the ways they can also benefit. According to The State of Open Banking 2019, \"risk averse culture\" was a major barrier for many traditional banks embracing open banking. However, many banks can in fact benefit from the technological advancements open banking may bring, and may have to do so if they are to prevent customers from moving over to tech-savvy competitors. Tom Catchpole, Open Banking Lead at Account Technologies, believes that as well as compliance through regulations, it is also important to highlight what traditional banks can gain from engaging with open banking: \"You need to incentivise the banks to make a success of it. The FCA stick, or the CMA stick, incentivises so far, but I then think we need to look at how we incentivise through greed, essentially, how they could actually earn money for it.\" Wilson explains that this should help prevent some of the \"cliff-edge\" scenarios that have occurred this year: \"The FCA saw the panic that the fourteenth of September cliff-edge was creating amongst TPPs, who hadn't necessarily finished their migration to APIs, and also banks who hadn't necessarily, although they should have built their APIs and put them live. So, they've got this six month adjustment period that runs up to the fourteenth of March. But, if, again, TPPs leave migration to the fourteenth of March and banks leave finishing their APIs to the fourteenth of March, then we've got another cliff-edge. Unlocking the potential of dataOhlhausen believes that ultimately, open banking and PSD2 have the potential to allow customers to unlock significant benefits from their own data: \"They think their data is now being exploited by the big techs, while they cannot do it the other way around. However, I would argue that, based on GDPR, we already have the mechanism in place to also access the big tech data... If I want to switch my car insurance and I have this comparison site which asks me to fill in all the data about my car, and at the end of the form, after half an hour, I make a suggestion and then it shows me which other insurance I could use and I could save money. \"All that, I could avoid, by just giving my car insurance access credentials to that service, to pull out the data from my car insurance and do that for me. Or my telecoms, my electricity. All that data that I have buried somewhere should be made available\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-093B4C0EC7C344B1A809597F181744CE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMY-90H1-DYG0-74CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1322\"/><timeReceived>2:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Photo: Vincent Tullo, New York Times 2017</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David Fincher's 2010 film, \"The Social Network,\" chronicled the rise of Facebook from Harvard dorm rooms to a revolutionary multibillion-user social network. It also etched a particular impression of a set of twins named Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The two were remembered flatly as the chiseled, privileged jocks that sued Mark Zuckerberg for stealing the idea behind Facebook. In the years since, things have changed, with twists of irony. Zuckerberg has become the face of the pitfalls and evils of big tech, and the twins are now lauded as the prescient poster boy entrepreneurs behind the tech breakthrough known as cryptocurrency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Winklevoss brothers are cast in this fresh light in \"Bitcoin Billionaires\" the new book from Ben Mezrich, the very same author of \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" which \"The Social Network\" was based on. Mezrich spoke with The Chronicle about his new book, scheduled for release Tuesday, May 21, and how it serves as both a corrective origin story of the Winklevoss twins and a thrilling primer on the future of currency.</p><p> Q: What led you back to the Winklevoss twins for this book?</p><p> A: For the past couple years, people have been calling me and emailing me saying, you should write about bitcoin, because I write about that sort of thing. But it's never interested me. \u2026 But I read the New York Times headline that the Winklevii twins were the \"Bitcoin Billionaires.\" It blew my mind. Because these were the same guys who were the bad guys in \"The Social Network,\" and suddenly they were standing sort of at the beginning of another revolution.</p><p> Q: Part of the perception of them as 'bad guys' comes from your book \"The Accidental Billionaires.\" But in this new book, you re-evaluate them. What was initially wrong about your understanding of the twins?</p><p> A: When I wrote \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" the twins were one of my main sources. I had gotten to know them pretty well. But I had judged them. They were easy to judge. \u2026 But at the same time, there was this kind of really incredible streak of 1950s kind of morality that I think their characters always had. They really believe in this sort of \"Men of Harvard\" and this idea of right and wrong, and this idea of \u2014 you get knocked down and you get back up. They really felt that Mark Zuckerberg screwed them. It wasn't about money. It was about being betrayed. And I think there's something very respectable about that, even in the initial telling of the story.</p><p> I really do think that as much as we got Mark Zuckerberg right in the original telling, we got the Winklevii twins wrong. They are those guys. They are the mirror twins rowing together. They are the big men on campus, and they are the guys who wore suits to meet with Larry Summers. But at the same time, they speak multiple languages and they studied Latin. They can computer code, and they understand economics. They weren't part of these two revolutions by accident.</p><p> \"Bitcoin Billionaires,\" by author Ben Mezrich, will be released Tuesday, May 21. Photo: Flatiron Books</p><p> Q: Zuckerberg's own public standing has shifted dramatically in his relationship to issues of privacy and the choices he's made with Facebook. What are your thoughts on this narrative shift?</p><p> A: I do think this is who he's been all along. I really think from the very beginning, he set out to dominate and change the social order. He believed from the very beginning that the walls we build of privacy are bad. And that the more we share and the more our data is out there, the better the world is.</p><p> Q: Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, recently wrote an opinion piece that called for breaking up the \"monopoly\" that is Facebook. What was your reaction?</p><p> A: The idea of breaking up Facebook \u2014 I don't even know what that really means. Cut out Instagram so we all either join Facebook or Instagram? That doesn't make any difference. And I don't know how breaking it up really changes anything. The problem with these technologies is they need to dominate. They have to be a monopoly for them to work. If everyone's not on Facebook, then Facebook is kind of useless, right? I think what Chris Hughes is really trying to say is there shouldn't be a Facebook anymore. And I don't know if that's the answer either.</p><p> Q: What do you see as an answer?</p><p> A: I think a simple fix to Facebook is it becomes a subscription, that you pay a certain fee to be on Facebook that gets rid of the whole idea of selling data. You can wall your privacy as much as you want because they're not making any money off of it. I think that's one possibility \u2014 a subscription method. There's a couple of other possibilities.</p><p> The idea of regulation \u2014 everyone hates regulation, but at the same time, when you have something so dominant in our lives, so incredibly powerful, there has to be some oversight. It can't just be Mark Zuckerberg sitting in a room, saying I'm going to decide who gets to say what.</p><p> Author Ben Mezrich has reconsidered his view of the Winklevoss twins. Photo: Courtesy , Ben Mezrich</p><p> Q: You write in the prologue that cryptocurrency is \"a fundamental paradigm shift, and it will eventually change everything.\" How do you see the future of cryptocurrency?</p><p> A: I know that's somewhat controversial. I do think there are going to be people on either side of that. Listen, 100 years from now, we are not going to be paying for things with cut-down trees in an animal-hide wallet. We're not going to be bartering with cash. Cash is not going to exist in the future. I really don't see that happening.</p><p> I can't imagine 100 years from now, with our automatic cars and with our phones that pay for everything, there's going to be any need or want for cash. The future is crypto. It's some sort of electronic currency that is instantly transferable, that doesn't have any particular government making decisions over it and that isn't run by a single bank. As long as you've got stable governments, cash makes sense. But as soon as your country doesn't do so well, your cash becomes very scary.</p><p> In Cyprus, literally overnight they just took everyone's deposits, took a percentage of everyone's money. Up to 50% of your money just vanished the next day. And you think, well, it can't ever happen in America. No, it can't right now happen in America. But one day, if things go to s\u2014, certainly it could.</p><p> Q: Two of your books have become films (\"21\" and \"The Social Network\"). Are there similar plans here as well?</p><p> A: It's going to be a big movie. I don't have any specifics to tell you, other than Columbia (Pictures), which did \"The Social Network,\" would be distributing it. I would love to see Armie (Hammer) play (the twins) again, but it's too early to tell at this point. But, yes, it is going to be a movie.</p><p> \"Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption\"</p><p> By Ben Mezrich</p><p> Flatiron Books</p><p> (288 pages; $27.99)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-7c4322eb989f67c7071587f47a450e66e895f24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W58-KNV1-DXVP-V36G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But with this growth come new problems and, inevitably, new regulation. We must ensure that this regulation does not stifle tomorrow's innovations, whose details we cannot predict in advance.<br/>In a recent New York Times op-ed, Kara Swisher zeroes in on the way the large tech companies on which we've come to depend violate our privacy. She writes that it's time to \"think harder about the trades we are making from the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules - rules that have teeth - on big tech companies.\"</p><p><br/>Readers will likely concentrate on Swisher's call for greater government regulation. Many of us favor less regulation, and others more. That's an important debate, but in the world in which we currently live government regulators won't be closing up shop anytime soon, nor will tech companies be nationalized.<br/>Much of the near-term answer to how to protect our privacy online lies in the other regulatory force Swisher identifies. We as consumers must think harder about when and how we divulge private information. This kind of regulation truly has teeth in that it deploys billions of points of observation and response, which keeps mistakes limited and local and allows companies to continue to innovate and disseminate best practices.<br/>Rather than assuming that online privacy lives and dies in their hands, government regulators should focus on how to create the right conditions to deploy this powerful decentralized force.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Teeth Cut Both Ways</emphasis><br/>Swisher imagines new government regulation of companies like Facebook and Google taking the form of new laws and agencies to enforce them:<br/>The question, of course, is what those rules should look like. Some argue the United States needs a hefty, multipronged national privacy bill that would include more stringent requirements for how tech giants run their platforms. (Some even think there should be a new agency to oversee the industry.)<br/>In the aftermath of Facebook's fiasco with Cambridge Analytica and several smaller scandals involving Google, some might say the answer is simple: tech companies shouldn't compile or sell the personal data they receive during the course of operations. But that is a fundamental part of what this generation of tech companies does.<br/>Targeted advertising, finely tuned internet search, and customized product recommendations are the lifeblood of companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. The ability to use and profit from these data, theoretically anonymized at the individual level, is why so many of their services are \"free\" to consumers.<br/>New regulations must therefore draw boundaries while allowing some uses of data not deemed as great a threat to consumers' privacy. But some activities may be safe or at least tolerable in the hands of one type of company and problematic in the hands of another. As regulations grow more complex and arbitrary across lines of business and ultimately firms, familiar problems with government regulation also grow teeth.<br/>Regulators want to remain independent from firms in the market, but cannot possibly be as knowledgeable as those firms. But with interaction between the two parties comes influence peddling. Market-leading incumbents are known to influence government to get rules that raise barriers to entry or yield advantages over existing competitors. With observers already concerned about tech giants' market power, a flood of new top-down regulations could make the problem worse.<br/>The dilemmas become even more vexing when considering innovation that hasn't yet happened. Swisher's call for regulators to act now before tomorrow's technology becomes a threat to privacy actually exposes the problem inherent in doing so:<br/>Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company's top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don't. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don't. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you.<br/>Swisher is right to worry about the privacy implications of these technologies still in their infancy. But the applications she names are speculative; the only certainty is that there will be many uses we haven't come close to thinking of yet. A complex web of inflexible rules will tie the hands of future innovators, throwing a wrench in the gears of the evolutionary process that makes technological innovation so valuable to society.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Knowledge Is Power</emphasis><br/>While Swisher may not approach the issues described above with enough caution, she does do a good job of stressing the importance of an educated consumer base. Relying exclusively on regulators to protect oneself against identity theft and other inappropriate uses of data is like leaving one's car keys in the ignition because a would-be car thief faces the threat of jail time. No matter the strength of that regulatory backstop, a well-informed consumer also locks the door and pockets the keys.<br/>Consumers must demand clear and accurate disclosure from tech companies regarding how their data will be used. Such disclosure should include taking steps to keep individuals anonymous, to limit internal uses of the data, and to govern whether and how companies can sell data to third parties.<br/>Top-down rules from regulators on how data may and may not be used can prevent certain behaviors, but an educated consumer base causes tech companies to take consumer decisions into account to find optimal outcomes. Suppose Facebook earns substantial revenue from uses of data that many consumers, when informed of that fact, find unacceptable. In a market in which consumers are informed, Facebook could offer two tiers of service, one at which consumers pay a monthly fee for services, and the other at which consumers pay no fee but Facebook has greater rights to use consumers' data.<br/>Such multitiered solutions are unlikely to develop under a tight regulatory regime because such complex outcomes are far more difficult to enforce than simply putting a rule in place for everyone and preempting consumers' choice. More generally, a system in which informed consumers interact with innovation by firms can reach outcomes that regulators could never formulate in advance.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Billions of Regulators</emphasis><br/>We live in a world of active government regulation. Using the arguments above to say we don't need regulation of tech companies or that any regulation will be harmful may be theoretically satisfying to some but is not a realistic outcome of the current debate.<br/>Government regulators can be part of the solution to privacy issues surrounding tech companies by drafting and enforcing clear rules requiring thorough, accurate, and straightforward disclosure of how they will use consumers' data. Rather than having regulators guess what outcomes consumers want and risking curtailing future entry and innovation, this path for regulators helps foster an educated consumer base.<br/>We are much better off with billions of decentralized regulators who own their own data and can make informed decisions than a few centralized bodies that guess which rules are ideal. Hopefully the centralized regulators we do have will take steps to empower the rest of us.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-59330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRK1-F03R-W000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1210\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 AIER, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Institute For Economic Research</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You bet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, anyone beyond the dwindling band of tech- utopians will be more aware of how easy it is to offer up your data to a tech platform or third parties, without understanding who could access it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But are we concerned or even aware enough about the speed of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, gathering by authoritarian governments, potentially with far greater impact on the global data ecosystem and our own lives? Not remotely. Of the emerging interfaces of policy, regulation and digital innovation, this is the one that troubles me most.</p><p>More so than the arrogance of Silicon Valley, because for all the many shortcomings of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, they are being dragged into a public debate about their activities and forced to change some of their conduct - or suffer the competitive consequences.</p><p>For truly unaccountable power in data-use and AI, look to major state players with weak accountability. Foremost is, China, where the speed of innovation and implementation of robotics and advanced machine learning is matched by a tightening of control by the state.</p><p>Last year I interviewed some Chinese tech figures for The Economist and found their scale and ambition awesome; Didi Chuxing, having seen off Uber, is now working with manufacturers to introduce driverless cars to Chinese cities within the decade.</p><p>WeChat, the micro-messaging service with nearly a billion users, is the means by which many Chinese customers pay for goods and exchange information, creating a vast info-harvest on how its users live. Hangzhou as the country's leading the \"smart city\" can track every resident, their social media activity, purchases and movements. Promethean in its ambition, many of these developments are also prospectively dystopian when it coincides with a system of state surveillance, combined with rejection of the rights of citizens to change their system of government. A pilot scheme in Suining has awarded people points for \"good\" behaviour, and deducted points for \"bad\" behaviour, from traffic offences to politically inconvenient activity.</p><p>\"Social ranking\" - in which data on everything from your credit score to your traffic fines is logged and coded to produce a score of your usefulness as a civilian - most benefits those who seek to exert control.</p><p>These projects are now so closely intertwined with the interests of those who govern China that they appoint its representatives to the boards of major companies - and new laws enshrine the ability of the state to grab data on wide-ranging grounds.</p><p>For all the grubbier opportunism of Western tech companies, they have a more cautious relationship with government. A free press means that abuses are revealed and titanic companies such as Facebook can crash into icebergs. Big-data systems in democracies are most often designed for profit, meaning that users have the ultimate sanction of simply switching off their accounts.</p><p>By contrast, we are only just starting to pay sufficient attention to the Kremlin's growing, threatening obsession with AI. The point of Vladimir Putin's boast about his new nuclear weapons cache was not just the return to Cold War competition in deadly missiles - but that AI might help even up the scales with the US. \"AI,\" Putin says, \"is key to Russia beating the US in defence.\"</p><p>The power and threat of AI lies in the fact that it is now so close to all our lives and impervious to state borders, as companies increasing integrate search engines, speech-recognition and automated customer-service bots into their products and services.</p><p>The West cannot opt out of the race against AI developers in undemocratic countries, because it is a globalised business, whose products can be transferred at low cost across borders. That makes it virtually impossible to guard against some data ending up in the wrong hands.</p><p>So far, our ability to regulate has lagged: the former UK information commissioner Christopher Graham reckons Britain is 10 years behind developments in data-gathering. But that is changing as the public mood becomes more testing. In an open society, more pressure for transparency, a free flow of information and noisy pressure groups create checks and balances that will help us better understand and deal with AI.</p><p>Where these are lacking, beware the true Behemoth of data- collection: largely unaccountable big states embracing big tech.</p><p>- Telegraph Group Anne McElvoy is senior editor at The Economist.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>CAPTION:</p><p>A pilot scheme in the southwest Chinese city of Suining has awarded people points for \"good\" behaviour, and deducted points for \"bad\" behaviour, from traffic offences to politically inconvenient activity.</p><p>Picture: GETTY IMAGES</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DOPST-TDP180403A0071139448621-BM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOPST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S12-KPX1-DYTR-J50M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax New Zealand All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Dominion Post (Wellington, New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SQW</classCode><className>PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000298</classCode><className>CITIZENSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

It s my Constitution! It s my decision! , I shouted, but my black Labrador, Jess, just rolled over and went back to sleep. I tweeted my indignation, but my followers took Jess s lead on the issue.</p><p>I thought I had imagined it all when I saw a letter by David McRedmond, chief executive of TV3, in a national newspaper.The letter said:  Googlecould equally have had a message, subject to its unregulated whims, that said Googlebelieves marriage is between a man and a woman. Would that be acceptable?  It wouldn t, of course. There would have been a terrible hoo-haa.</p><p>But there was barely a complaint, because Googlewas playing to the position of most Irish googlers and, as a publicly quoted company, it would be very foolish to have done otherwise. McRedmond made the valid point that had the broadcast moratorium not been in place, TV and radio could have registered complaints about  interference in the referendum . Because of the moratorium, TV3 could not even highlight the story on air.</p><p>McRedmond argues that the broadcast moratorium should be abolished outside the hours of voting. That would give Googlecompetition when it sends out a political message.</p><p>McRedmond says the broadcast moratorium   which includes UK broadcasters who are widely available in Ireland, yet not subject to our national rules   is anachronistic in the age of global communications.</p><p>Others, including some within the tech industry, argue that platforms such as Googleshould be subject to national regulation, to stop them pushing a political agenda in the run-up to a national vote.</p><p>Googles declaration of its support for a  Yes  vote, as well as Twitter s, has been the subject of debate behind the closed doors of tech companies.</p><p>READ MORE: How Googleworks hard to keep staff happy</p><p>Some employees have huge issues with their companies making political statements. One senior techie explained the background to the declarations of support for gay marriage as competition with Apple, whose CEO, Tim Cooke, recently came out as gay and slammed  religious freedom  laws in Indiana and Arkansas that open the door to discrimation. One hundred similar bills are pending in 12 US states.</p><p>Salesforce has threatened to limit its dealings with states that have such regressive laws, but some senior techies are privately unconvinced by the depth of the big tech companies  social commitment, because they are not threatening to pull out of other countries that have discriminatory laws against gays or against women.</p><p>Googleis under investigation by the EU for allegedly rigging searches to lead users to its own selling platforms. In the US, the company has lobbied on a big scale to fight net regulation measures that might limit it, stating:  Googles political spending decisions are based exclusively on what s best for Googleand an open internet. </p><p>Whether that s right or wrong, it is understandable from a business point of view. What s more open to question is why Googleshould be advocating a  Yes  to same-sex marriage in Ireland.</p><p>Tech expert, Karlin Lillingon, explains the move as a commitment to  diversity  in the workplace, and Cooke has said, again and again, that discrimination is not good for business.</p><p>The stance is also a marketing tool, appealing both to the companies  own workforce and to their consumers. Gay rights are not threatening to corporate culture. Gay people are less likely to have their own families than straights, and that gay reality must also appeal to creative corporations. In her trailing-blazing book, Willing Slaves: How the Overwork Culture is Ruling our Lives, Madeleine Bunting described a Microsoft office in which employees  work became their lives, complete with yoga, grocery delivery and a well-being centre. The average age of employees was 34. When Bunting asked what happened when the employees had children, she was told,  If you choose to have a family or play golf, you have to be honest about what kind of job you can do. </p><p>Personally, I found the declarations of support by Googleand by Twitter, for same-sex marriage, demeaning. I m not going to tailor my vote on my Constitution to please any American multinational. But that is a different level of penetration into a national debate than when Google, whose excellent product accounts for 95% of internet searches in Ireland, tell me how to vote when I use the search engine. Particularly as most of us use Googleas if it were neutral, as if it were a publicly-owned utility.</p><p>There is quite simply no comparison between the power of a company like Googleand the power of the Catholic Church in Ireland, today.</p><p>But we don t seem to care how we are manipulated, as long as we agree with the message.</p><p>What happens next, of course, is that we stop noticing the manipulation and stop having minds of our own.</p><p>If we have learned anything from our mid-20th century history, it s that you don t give your mind over to an organisation, even if it s telling you to love your neighbour.</p><p>DISCOVER MORE CONTENT LIKE THIS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-333209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G38-8D91-JCW9-239G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1015\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The entire series of posts is available here[1].]This post is authored by Kristian Stout[2], Associate Director at the International Center for Law ...onomics.There is a push underway to punish big tech firms[3], both for alleged wrongdoing[4] and in an effort to prevent future harm[5]. But the movement to use antitrust law to punish big tech firms is far more about political expediency than it is about sound competition policy.For a variety of reasons, there is a current of dissatisfaction in society with respect to the big tech companies, some of it earned, and some of it unearned. Between March 2019[6] and September 2019[7], polls suggested that Americans were increasingly willing to entertain breaking up or otherwise increasing regulation on the big tech firms. No doubt, some significant share of this movement in popular opinion is inspired by increasingly negative reporting from major news outlets (see, for a small example, 1[8], 2[9], 3[10], 4[11], 5[12], 6[13], 7[14], 8[15]). But, the fact that these companies make missteps does not require that any means at hand should be used to punish them.Further, not only is every tool not equal in dealing with the harms these companies could cause, we must be mindful that, even when some harm occurs, these companies generate a huge amount of social welfare. </p><p>Our policy approaches to dealing with misconduct, therefore, must be appropriately measured.To listen to the media, politicians, and activists, however, one wouldn't know that anything except extreme action \u2014 often using antitrust law \u2014 is required. Presidential hopefuls want to smash the big tech companies, while activists and academics see evidence of anticompetitive conduct in every facet of these companies' behavior. Indeed, some claim that the firms themselves are per se a harm to democracy[16].The confluence of consumer dissatisfaction and activist zeal leads to a toxic result: not wanting to let a good crisis go to waste, activists and politicians push the envelope on the antitrust theories they want to apply to the detriment of the rule of law. Consumer concerns Missteps by the big tech companies, both perceived and real, have led to some degree of consumer dissatisfaction. In terms of real harms data breaches[17] and privacy scandals[18] have gained more attention in recent years and are undoubtedly valid concerns of consumers.In terms of perceived harms, it has, for example, become increasingly popular to blame big tech companies for tilting the communications landscape in favor of one[19] or another[20] political preference. Ironically, the accusations leveled against big tech are frequently at odds. Some progressives blame big tech for helping Donald Trump[21] to be elected president, while some conservatives believe a pervasive bias[22] in Silicon Valley in favor of progressive policies harms conservative voices.But, at the same time, consumers are well familiar with the benefits that search engines, the smartphone revolution, and e-commerce have provided to society. The daily life of the average consumer is considerably better today than it was in past decades thanks to the digital services and low cost technology that is in reach of even the poorest among us.So why do consumers appear to be listening to the heated rhetoric of the antitrust populists?Paul Seabright pointed to one of the big things that I think is motivating consumer willingness to listen to populist attacks on otherwise well-regarded digital services. In his keynote speech at ICLE's 'Dynamic Competition and Online Platforms' conference[23] earlier this month, he discussed the role of trust in the platform ecosystem. According to Seabright,Large digital firms create anxiety in proportion to how much they meet our needs They are strong complements to many of our talents and activities - but they also threaten to provide lots of easy substitutes for us and our talents and activities The more we trust them the more we (rightly) fear the abuse of their trust.Extending this insight, we imbue these platforms with a great deal of trust because they are so important to our daily lives. And we have a tendency to respond dramatically to (perceived or actual) violations of trust by these platforms because they do such a great job in nearly every respect. When a breach of that trust happens \u2014 even if its relative impact on our lives is small, and the platform continues to provide a large amount of value \u2014we respond not in terms of its proportionate effect on our lives, but in the emotional terms of one who has been wronged by a confidant.It is that emotional lever that populist activists and politicians are able to press. The populists can frame the failure of the firms as the sum total of their existence, and push for extreme measures that otherwise (and even a few short years ago) would have been unimaginable. Political opportunism The populist crusade is fueled by the underlying sentiment of consumers, but has its own separate ends. Some critics of the state of antitrust law are seeking merely a realignment of priorities[24] within existing doctrine. The pernicious crusade of antitrust populists, however, seeks much more. These activists (and some presidential hopefuls) want nothing short of breaking up big tech[25] and of returning the country to some ideal of 'democracy'[26] imagined as having existed in the hazy past when antitrust laws were unevenly enforced.It is a laudable goal to ensure that the antitrust laws are being properly administered on their own terms, but it is an entirely different project to crusade to make antitrust great again based on the flawed understandings from a century ago.In few areas of life would most of us actually yearn to reestablish the political and social order of times gone by \u2014 notwithstanding presidential rhetoric. The sepia-toned crusade to smash tech companies into pieces inherits its fervor from Louis Brandeis and his fellow travelers who took on the mustache-twisting villains of their time: Carnegie, Morgan, Mellon and the rest of the allegedly dirty crew of scoundrels.Matt Stoller's recent book Goliath[27] captures this populist dynamic well. He describes the history of antitrust passionately, as a morality play between the forces of light and those of darkness. On one side are heroes like Wright Patman, a scrappy poor kid from Texas who went to a no-name law school and rose to prominence in Washington as an anti-big-business crusader. On the other side are shadowy characters like Andrew Mellon, who cynically manipulated his way into government after growing bored with administering his vast, immorally acquired economic empire.A hundred years ago the populist antitrust quest was a response to the success of industrial titans, and their concentration of wealth in the hands of relatively few. Today, a similar set of arguments are directed at the so-called big tech companies. Stoller sees the presence of large tech firms as inimical to democracy itself[28]\u2014 'If we don't do something about big tech, something meaningful, we'll just become a fascist society. It's fairly simple.' Tim Wu has made similar claims (which my colleague Alec Stapp has ably rebutted[29]).In the imagination of the populists, there are good guys and bad guys and the optimal economy would approach atomistic competition. In such a world, the 'little guy' can have his due and nefarious large corporations cannot become too economically powerful relative to the state.Politicians enter this mix of consumer sentiment and populist activism with their own unique priors. On the one hand, consumer dissatisfaction makes big tech a ripe target to score easy political points. It's a hot topic that fits easily into fundraising pitches. After all, who really cares if the billionaires lose a couple of million dollars through state intervention?In truth, I suspect that politicians are ambivalent about what exactly to do to make good on their anti-big tech rhetoric. They will be forced to admit that these companies provide an enormous amount of social value, and if they destroy that value, fickle voters will punish them. The threat at hand is if politicians allow themselves to be seduced by the simplistic policy recommendations of the populists. Applying the right tool to the job Antitrust is a seductive tool to use against politically disfavored companies. It is an arcane area of law which, to the average observer, will be just so much legalese. It is, therefore, relatively easy to covertly import broader social preferences through antitrust action and pretend that the ends of the law aren't being corrupted.But this would be a mistake.The complicated problem with the big tech companies is that they indeed could be part of a broader set of social ills mentioned above. Its complicated because it's highly unlikely that these platforms cause the problems in society, or that any convenient legal tool like antitrust will do much to actually remedy the problems we struggle with.Antitrust is a goal-focused body of law, and the goal it seeks\u2014optimizing consumer welfare\u2014is distinctly outside of the populist agenda. The real danger in the populist campaign is not just the social losses we will incur if they successfully smash productive firms, but the long term harm to the rule of law.The American system of law is fundamentally predicated on an idea of promulgating rules of general applicability, and resorting to sector- or issue-specific regulations when those general bodies of law are found to be inapplicable or ineffective.Banking regulation is a prime example. Banks are subject to general regulation from entities like the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, but, for particular issues, are subject to other agencies and laws. Requirements for deterring money laundering, customer privacy obligations, and rules mandating the separation of commercial banking from investment activities all were enacted through specific legislation aimed to tailor the regulatory regime that banks faced.Under many of the same theories being propounded by the populists, antitrust should have been used for at least some of these ends. Couldn't you frame the 'problem' of mixing commercial banking and investment as one of impermissible integration that harms the competitive process? Wouldn't concerns for the privacy of bank consumers sound in exactly the same manner as that proposed by advocates who claim that concentrated industries lack the incentive to properly include privacy as a dimension of product quality?But if we hew to rigorous interpretation of competition policy, the problem for critics is that their claims that actually sound in antitrust - that Amazon predatorily prices, or Google engages in anticompetitive tying, for example - are highly speculative and not at all an easy play if pressed in litigation. So they try 'new' theories of antitrust as a way to achieve preferred policy ends. Changing well accepted doctrine, such as removing the recoupement requirement from predatory pricing in order to favor small firms, or introducing broad privacy or data sharing obligations as part of competition 'remedies', is a terrible path for the stability of society and the health of the rule of law.Concerns about privacy, hate speech, and, more broadly, the integrity of the democratic process are critical issues to wrestle with. But these aren't antitrust problems. If we lived in a different sort of society, where the rule of law meant far less than it does here, its conceivable that we could use whatever legal tool was at hand to right the wrongs of society. But this isn't a good answer if you take seriously constitutional design; allowing antitrust law to 'solve' broader social problems is to suborn Congress in giving away its power to a relatively opaque enforcement process.We should not have our constitution redesigned by antitrust lawyers.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...kname=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20Lawyershttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...kname=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20Lawyershttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...kname=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20Lawyershttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...le=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20LawyersThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...kname=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20Lawyershttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...kname=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20Lawyershttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...kname=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20Lawyershttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fwe-should-not-have-our-constitution-redesigned-by-antitrust-lawyers%2F...le=We%20Should%20Not%20Have%20Our%20Constitution%20Redesigned%20by%20Antitrust%20LawyersThe</url> post We Should Not Have Our Constitution Redesigned by Antitrust Lawyers[30] appeared first on Truth on the Market[31].

With President Trump and members of the US administration absent due to the US shutdown, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanual Macron also not present, the event was more business focused than in 2018. Business leaders had a mixed view on the economy, and were focused on the opportunities and risks presented by emerging technologies. DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Davos is done for another year. The World Economic Forum'sannual meeting[3] in Davos, Switzerland, wrapped up on Friday after a whirlwind few days of forum sessions, meetings, dinners, and night caps. </p><p>Business Insider had a team of six editors in the Swiss ski resort, who met with more than 40 CEOs and business leaders over the course of the week. Here's what they were saying:Actually, the economic picture isn't all that badThe mood was generally pessimistic around the global economy, what with the trade war[4], a slowdown in China, and the notable absence of several world leaders due to domestic policy challenges. That said, few people said they expected there to be a recession[5] in the next 12 months, and several globally renowned investors told Business Insider they thought the US economy in particular is in much better shape than the mood would suggest, saying economic data doesn't fully capture the benefits of advancements in technology. Specifically, we repeatedly heard about the risk of the US \"talking itself into a recession,\" and one of the investors said that while this could be the 8th inning of the economic cycle[6] in the US, like a recent World Series match-up[7], the game could last 18. As for China, well, sure it's slowing down. But China's likely to introduce measures to juice the economy again, currency outflows are less of a concern than in the past, and even with a slowdown in growth, 5% growth ain't bad[8], several attendees told us. \"Obviously the China-US situation is probably the biggest threat that could see a slowdown, especially in the Chinese economy,\" Martin Gilbert, co-CEO of $736 billion Aberdeen Standard Investments, told Business Insider's Sara Silverstein, echoing others at Davos. \"We shouldn't overreact to that. Even if there were no exports, the Chinese economy would still grow 5% a year on domestic growth. It's still pretty resilient. Most countries would love to have a 5% growth rate.\" The mood around Europe was much less positive, in contrast, with the UK facing an extended period of political turmoil, Macron missing from Davos amid the yellow vest protests, and Germany close to a recession[9].Tech's getting ready for regulationMicrosoft, Palantir, Google Cloud, Facebook, AWS, Wipro, Infosys, and Cloudflare all had prominent spots on the Davos promenade, and much of the discussion over the course of the week centered around the possibilities offered by things like AI, big data, and cloud computing, along with the responsibilities and potential regulation of big tech. Google's CFO Ruth Porat set the tone on Tuesday at a panel discussion, highlighting how data could be used for good before praising European data privacy regulation GDPR[10]. Microsoft president Brad Smith told my colleague Jake Kanter that US federal privacy laws are inevitable[11], and could come into force as early as this year. \"In a world where we're all working with data I think we all have opportunities to ask how we can manage it better and in a way that sustains the public's confidence,\" Smith said. Smith's boss, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, also praised GDPR later in the week on a panel[12], saying he hoped the US would have something similar. And Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg spent the week telling Davos attendees that Facebook was ready for regulation[13].The healthcare industry's excited about the potential of AIOne of the areas where tech has a huge amount of potential is in the healthcare space, from applying AI to data to aid drug discovery, to tracking patients to better measure improvements in their quality of life after treatment.  That's lead to some dramatic shifts at drug companies.Novartis for example now has 400 data scientists on staff, according to Jay Bradner, who heads the pharma giant's drug research and discovery as president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. And it's triggered lots of conversations between different parts of the healthcare system and the tech sector. Peter Lee, corporate vice president of Microsoft Healthcare, told me that the company's recently announced partnership with Walgreens[14] would hopefully be the first of several with different parts of the healthcare system. And Marc Harrison, the CEO of health system Intermountain Healthcare, said he was keen to work with tech companies with Microsoft. \"We're interested in, not only automation, but how do we understand predictive analytics, how do we understand social biometrics,\" Harrison said. \"How do we really get as complete a non-creepy view of our patients as possible.\"Everyone's talking about their company's purposeYou couldn't go far at Davos without hearing someone talking about their company's purpose or mission. Most would tell you that's been a focus for years, of course. But it was put in sharp relief last year just before Davos when BlackRock chief Larry Fink sent a letter to CEOs[15] stressing the need for a clear long-term strategy and an understanding of the societal impact of their business. At the time, it ruffled some feathers. A year after that letter (and a Davos panel on the same theme led by Insider Inc. CEO Henry Blodget[16]), it's clear that the idea's now mainstream. In simple terms, practicing better capitalism appears to be good for business[17]. Unilever's chief marketer Keith Weed told my colleague Nich Carlson it's proven the business case for operating sustainably[18], saying that the company's sustainable brands are outpacing its other brands and delivering 70% of its growth. \"Companies are realizing that they can have an impact on improving the environment, and improving their quality and growing at the same time,\" Marc Pritchard, marketing chief at consumer giant P...told me. \"In fact, the two go hand-in-hand.\" And the chairman ofLombard Odier[19], a Swiss private bank founded in 1796 with over 274 billion Swiss francs ($275 billion) in assets under management, said this shift represents \"one of the most interesting performance opportunities[20]for our clients than we have ever had for the last 25 years.\"Who's going to take responsibility for closing the skills gap?Regardless of whether you think AI is going to create jobs or displace them[21], it seems fairly clear the skills required to succeed over the next 20 years are going to be different to the skills required in the last 20 years. The Edelman annual trust survey, published just before the WEF meeting opened, [22]found that 59% of employees worry about not having the training and skills necessary for a well-paying job, and 55% worry automation and other tech will make their job obsolete. A WEF report released a few days after the Edelman survey said 1.4 million US workers are likely to lose their job over the next decade. \"There is a large part of society that does not feel that this is going to be good for their future,\" IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, said on a panel.  KPMG global chairman Bill Thomas told Henry Blodget that companies need to see investing in internal training programs as a competitive advantage[23]. \"If you think about the evolution of where our workforce is going, whether that is the needs of our clients, whether that is the recognition that artificial intelligence, some of the disruption from technology that that's going to have on our workforce \u2014 the truth of the matter is I'm not going to wait for a government response,\" he said. And a number of attendees we spoke to highlighted the increased importance and appeal of \"learnability,\" or an ability to continue learning news skills throughout one's career. A certain percentage of employees will always jump at the chance to attend additional training, just as there's a group that won't be interested. The challenge is how to nudge the group in the middle. Ellyn Shook, Accenture's chief leadership ...man Resources officer, said the firm had created a Job Buddy for staff, making them aware of how much of their current role was at risk of automation, and which skills they should pick up given their current strengths. 4 in 5 staff said they'd take up the new training. Still, a heavy weight is likely to fall on governments. According to the WEF study, the private-sector can only profitably reskill 1 in 4 of the 1.4 million workers likely to be at-risk workers over the next decade. With collaboration between companies, that number gets close to 1 in 2. That leaves the small matter of 700,000+ people in the hands of the government.See Also: Barclays CEO says Edward Bramson, the activist investor agitating for change at the bank, hasn't laid out a

I support the bipartisan and commonsense \u2018bright line\u2019 rules for net neutrality \u2013 no blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization \u2013 that protect consumers, but the Save the Internet Act reaches far beyond these commonsense protections. In rural districts like mine, this bill would slow down or reduce network expansion, a critical delay as I fight to expand broadband connectivity in remote areas.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t even the first time we\u2019ve had a net neutrality debate. When <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>first announced he was repealing regulations, liberals would not stop talking about how this would radically change the internet as we knew it. But when the regulations ceased, these doomsday predictions fell flat. Life continued uninterrupted, and Americans enjoyed affordable and reliable internet access.  \u201cThis so-called attempt to \u2018save the internet\u2019 has nothing to do with better internet service; it\u2019s a gift to edge providers who want to market personal data. GOP members have introduced at least three bills that would protect consumers without overbearing government involvement \u2013 let\u2019s focus our attention on those practical solutions instead.\u201d  Background:  The Save the Internet Act would:      Allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to set prices, sanction investments and dictate how broadband companies interact with their customers.     Lay the groundwork for taxing and overregulating the internet.     Require FCC approval for development of new 5G and other innovative technologies, which would discourage, delay or block them altogether.     Limit access for rural Americans. Studies show that 80 percent of providers in rural areas incurred additional expenses when complying with the Obama-era net neutrality regulations, which led to delayed or reduced network expansion.     Allow big tech corporations like Facebook and Google to undermine American families\u2019 privacy. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN959466920190412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW6-4W61-DXCW-D1MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"397\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
