Nadat een dertigtal organisaties al verzet aangetekend had, vraagt nu ook het Amerikaans Congres om het project op pauze te zetten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Van onze redacteur  Karsten Lemmens</p><p>BrusselHet is nog maar enkele weken geleden sinds Facebook de virtuele munt libra voorstelde, en het protest blijft toenemen. Nu mengt ook het Amerikaanse parlement zich in de discussie. Maxine Waters, voorzitster van de commissie Financi\u00eble Diensten van het Huis van Afgevaardigden, schreef een brief naar de ceo en coo van Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg en Sheryl Sandberg, en naar David Marcus, die het libra-consortium zal leiden. Ze vraagt hen onmiddellijk de plannen te staken.</p><p>'Het lijkt erop dat dit een globaal financieel systeem wordt dat opereert vanuit Zwitserland, bedoeld als concurrentie voor het Amerikaanse monetaire beleid en de dollar', stelt de brief. 'Dat doet ernstige vragen rijzen over privacy, handel, nationale veiligheid en monetair beleid. Niet alleen voor de meer dan twee miljard Facebookgebruikers, maar ook voor investeerders, consumenten en de wereldwijde economie.'</p><p>De libra werd op 18 juni officieel voorgesteld. Het wordt een virtuele munt, waarmee gebruikers online kunnen betalen via apps als Messenger en Whatsapp. De libra heeft gelijkenissen met virtuele valuta zoals de bitcoin, maar verschilt toch fundamenteel van 'echte' cryptomunten. Zo zal de libra gekoppeld zijn aan een korf van internationale munten en zal ze worden overzien door de 'Libra Association'. Dat is een organisatie die in het Zwitserse Gen\u00e8ve wordt opgezet. Behalve Facebook zitten er partners in zoals Mastercard, Visa, Paypal, Spotify en Uber.</p><p>Door de libra in zo'n non-profitorganisatie onder te brengen, kan de munt strikt genomen geen 'Facebook-munt' worden genoemd. De negatieve connotatie, die na een onaflatende stroom van schandalen aan Facebook kleeft, zou de acceptatie van de libra niet bepaald helpen.</p><p>Rookgordijn</p><p>Volgens de Amerikaanse Congresleden is dat niet meer dan een rookgordijn. Zij verwijzen direct naar het problematische parcours dat Facebook heeft gereden. 'De risico's zijn nog veel ernstiger als we het problematische verleden van Facebook in acht nemen', klinkt het.</p><p>Waarna de brief de schandalen allemaal netjes opsomt: van privacyinbreuken zoals het Cambridge Analytica-schandaal en privacyboetes, over het verspreiden van haatdragende boodschappen, tot het be\u00efnvloeden van verkiezingen. Conclusie: Facebook is wel het laatste bedrijf waaraan je de controle over een virtuele munt kunt overlaten.</p><p>Omdat Facebook al wordt gebruikt door meer dan een kwart van de wereldbevolking, oordelen ze, is het noodzakelijk dat Facebook en zijn partners de implementatie onmiddellijk staken. En wel tot overheden en regulatoren onderzoeken hebben kunnen voeren en acties hebben kunnen ondernemen.</p><p>Indien niet zou er 'een nieuw Zwitsers financieel systeem kunnen ontstaan dat  too big to fail is.' Facebook reageerde in Amerikaanse media dat het aan de onderzoeken wil meewerken.</p><p>Het mag niet verrassen dat de brief vanuit Democratische hoek komt. In de VS tonen de Democraten zich almaar vijandiger ten opzichte van  big tech, dat volgens hen te veel macht heeft. Democratische presidentskandidaten zoals Elizabeth Warren pleiten er zelfs voor om de Silicon Valley- giganten op te splitsen.</p><p>Eerder deze week stuurde een dertigtal Amerikaanse non-profitorganisaties een brief naar Amerikaanse parlementsleden met de vraag Facebook te dwingen om de libra voorlopig niet verder te ontwikkelen. Zij menen dat 'de risico's te groot zijn om het plan verder te laten gaan terwijl er zoveel onbeantwoorde vragen zijn.</p><p>Believers en  non-believers</p><p>De libra kent intussen heel wat believers en non-believers. Zo noemde econoom Geert Noels de lancering 'een kantelpunt voor het financi\u00eble systeem.' Tegelijk denken anderen dat het zo'n vaart niet zal lopen, zoals professor economie Gert Peersman (UGent). Hij noemt de libra 'een financi\u00eble revolutie die er geen is', onder meer doordat libra's gedekt zijn door een korf van klassieke valuta, en er ook steeds voor kunnen worden ingeruild. Daardoor is de libra volgens hem wel degelijk onderhevig aan het monetaire beleid dat de klassieke centrale banken voeren. Mocht de libra een succes worden, dan is er volgens hem maar \u00e9\u00e9n grote winnaar: Facebook zelf.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESTAN-b06326029e5d11e9acf37c2000654eda</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESTAN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGW-PFN1-F151-W1W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343691</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Corelio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>De Standaard</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"60996\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>West-Vlaanderen Editie</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>5 Juli 2019 Vrijdag</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Krant</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>DUTCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>NEDERLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Yes, the company's founder will tell me how he'll avoid the fate of pets.com. Remember them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live from the world's financial capital, New York City. It's Friday, June 14th. I'm Paula Newton in for Richard Quest. And this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Okay, good evening, we continue to have developments on our top story. President Trump has firmly laid blame for the twin tanker explosions at the door of Iran despite fierce denials from the top brass in Tehran.</p><p>Now the U.S. military has released video which it says -- you can see it there -- shows an Iranian patrol boat removing an unexploded mine from one of the vessels hulls. This is what the evidence are pointing to.</p><p>But get this, the Japanese company that owns it says it doesn't believe it was attacked by a mine or a torpedo. A U.S. official now told CNN that small Iranian boats are preventing tugboats from actually towing away one of the tankers. That same officials says an Iranian boat tried to block the USS Bainbridge from getting to the scene.</p><p>And in just the last hour, the U.K. has said it is almost certain the Iranian military attacked those tankers. Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, Sam Kiley now at the Port of Khor Fakkan for us, where one of the sabotaged ships has now docked.</p><p>And Fred, we will get to you in a moment. But Sam, I want to turn to you in terms of where we're getting the evidence for this. What has transpired in the last few hours to get any clarity, if possible on what happened and who is responsible?</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it remains a very confused picture, Paula, but principally because we have this grainy videos, as you say, coming from the United States, which shows an Iranian vessel removing something from the hull of the Kokuka Courageous.</p><p>Now, that is not proof that they put that something there in the first place. That would be proof positive that they put perhaps an explosive device on the hull of this ship at the same time, we've got sources in British intelligence, as you say, saying that they believe that the Iranians may well have been behind it.</p><p>But whether that belief is based on American evidence, or their own British, evidence we don't yet know. Now, the Iranians are absolutely adamant that they had nothing to do with it, and indeed, that they rescued 23 crew members of one of the ships, both ships are still out in the Gulf of Oman. And there are reports that one at least is being harassed, or at least those involved in the salvage of it. And this is the Altair are being harassed by Iranian gunboats in international waters.</p><p>But again, we've only got the Pentagon's word on this. We have no separate evidence and cynicism about what Americans say, in regard to the sorts of issues that could be a cause of war, of course, set off alarm bells around the world, when one recalls the gigantic lies told by the British and the Americans in the run up to the Iraq invasion of 2003.</p><p>Notwithstanding that level of cynicism, there is a strong belief here in the Gulf, in Saudi Arabia, and in the UAE, and of course, in Israel further afield that the Iranians are using this sort of asymmetric tactic to signal just how dangerous they could be, if they chose to try to close that Strait of Hormuz, only 12 and a bit miles wide, a third of the world's oil goes through it.</p><p>And you can just see -- I don't know if you can see on the camera, but just on the horizon here, only about half a mile to a mile offshore where I'm standing, the horizon is absolutely choked effectively with tankers trying to come and go through the Straits of Hormuz, it's an extremely busy waterway and one really, one of the main arteries through which the economic blood of the whole planet pumps.</p><p>So from the perspective of the Americans who do believe the Iranians are behind this, this is a sign that they can pinch that artery -- Paula.</p><p>[15:05:20] NEWTON: And pinch, they are apparently, Sam, as we can see from that map, that is quite a choke point. And yet, Fred, you have been on the front lines of this, getting information from the Iranian government saying, look, these are strong, strong denials.</p><p>And yet what's that work there in Iran in terms of those denials, and yet, they have said quite, you know, aggressively in the last few months that they will change their behavior because of the Iranian deal that was cancelled by the United States.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you're absolutely right, Paula, and the Iranians really are very much denying that they were behind any of this. The interesting thing that we're seeing, especially from Iranian state media, which we've been watching very closely as well, they haven't really shown that video that we've just seen of that Iranian boat coming up to the tanker.</p><p>So certainly, that's not something that the Iranians have commented on, and certainly not something that is being really publicly widely shown here on media outlets.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Iranians are saying in the form of Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, saying, look, there's not even circumstantial evidence, he says that Iran was behind this. And it's interesting, if you see the semi-official farce news agency, it came out not too long ago, with report saying, and this is a quote, again, \"The American narrative is false,\" citing what we had at the beginning of our show, the owner or the operator of that tanker that was seen in that video, saying that the crew of that tanker does not believe that it was attacked by a mine or that it was hit, or that the explosion was caused by mine, but rather that projectiles were fired at the ship.</p><p>They are also apparently saying that one of the reasons why the crew seems to believe that is because all of the hits seemed to be above the waterline. Now, how much they really got to know of when this was taking place, how much situational awareness they would have had at that moment, we don't know.</p><p>But that's certainly one of the things that the Iranians are talking about here. At the same time, you're also correct. They are ripping into the U.S. They're saying, look, the U.S. is the side that's essentially inflaming tensions here in the Persian Gulf area, but also between the U.S. and Iran, and in general here, in this region.</p><p>Iran's Foreign Minister coming out and saying that the U.S. is trying to prevent de-escalation in this area. Of course, one of the reasons why the Iranians are saying that is because this attack took place as Iran's Supreme Leader was meeting the Prime Minister of Japan to try and talk about de-escalation, possibly also about an offer from President Trump to try and jumpstart at least talks or some sort of negotiations once again.</p><p>And the Iranians are saying, look at that point in time, there simply is absolutely no reason why Iran then would have attacked a tanker in those very narrow international waters, as Sam was just talking about.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, Fred and yet, as you've pointed out to us many times before, there are factions within Iran themselves that are sometimes at odds, we'll see if we get more information in the hours in the days to come about exactly what happened there. Our thanks to both Sam and Fred, appreciate it.</p><p>Now to try and get more perspective of this. I'm joined from Washington by Ambassador Barbara Leaf. She is a former U.S. Ambassador to the UAE. Now, you are saying of course, Ambassador, that this is not headed for war, and yet what kind of collateral damage could we see here, especially of the economic kind?</p><p>BARBARA LEAF, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UAE: So what I would say is this specific event, like the event off -- the set of events off of Fujairah, don't themselves rush us into to war. And both the Iranian leadership and President Trump have reiterated repeatedly over the past month that they do not desire to go to war. That said, there's a clear escalatory pattern at work now.</p><p>And of course, two countries that have had -- what I would term, an oftentimes violent non-relationship for over 40 years can nonetheless find themselves at war and some would argue we have been in a kind of shadow war, a twilight war, in David Crist's words for 40-some years.</p><p>NEWTON: Does this, partially though, you know, we've had in the last hour or so, we've had the U.K. -- Britain come out and say that they believe with almost near certainty that Iran was also involved in this.</p><p>I mean, everyone who has been following this, Britain was one of the country's trying to get the United States and Iran to stay in that deal. Does this carry more weight? And does it give more weight to what you call really a dangerous escalation that could be going on here?</p><p>LEAF: Look, this is a dangerous escalation. And I will say quite forthrightly, I haven't seen the evidence or the intelligence et cetera, but my first thought when I heard of the reports yesterday, as on May 12th, was who is the likely suspect? It's indisputably Iran.</p><p>I mean, Iran has a history of targeting commercial shipping, commercial cruise, even. They have the capabilities to pull off a highly complex, sophisticated attacks like these, and they have the motivation and this is like the Fujiwara attacks. It has all the hallmarks of a state actor and who has the motivation? It is Iran and they do have the capabilities.</p><p>[15:10:17] NEWTON: Where do we go from here now? You know, it's interesting when you look at the regional players here, and especially if you're talking about the UAE, which we have a lot of experience in Saudi Arabia, what do you think they do now, if they start to see this escalation, because as we've pointed out, there is a lot at stake?</p><p>LEAF: Well, it's not just these two countries that have a lot at stake. And I would note that both of the tankers had had recently departed from Saudi Arabia and a petrochemical refinery in UAE. So again, you have that connection that you have back in May.</p><p>All that said, this is really becoming a global problem, because of course, any disruption in the oil supply the spike in prices, et cetera that has an immediate bearing on global energy, global economies. So nobody is left undamaged in the end, if this persists.</p><p>NEWTON: And quickly, you do believe though that Iran is sending a message here one way or the other?</p><p>LEAF: Iran is sending multiple messages in multiple directions. First and foremost, to the administration, testing the proposition that the U.S. has any ability to stop this sort of thing and directing itself to two of the closest partners of the U.S., Saudi Arabia, UAE, to remind them that they too, are vulnerable, and they too will share in the pain that Iran is feeling from the so-called maximum pressure campaign.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and it will be interesting to see the U.S. -- the next moves from the U.S. both diplomatically and if there is any kind of reaction militarily, Barbara Leaf, thank you so much, really appreciate your perspective.</p><p>LEAF: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: And as the Ambassador was just saying, you know, we talk about oil prices, they had spiked a little bit, but now those oil prices are climbing a little bit after having really a bad day amid concerns over potential supply disruption.</p><p>That's one issue here after those tanker attacks, but they remain on track for a weekly loss, why? Weighed down by continued concerns over that trade dispute between the U.S. and China and we will have much more on that in just a little bit.</p><p>On Wall Street, the Dow has finally made it into positive territory when I had turned my back. There you go. They had spent most of the day in the red. Tech stocks are among the worst performers. Of course, they're being hit by an unexpectedly downbeat outlook from the chip maker, Broadcom.</p><p>Broadcom posted bleak results Thursday and issued -- and this is what's interesting here -- they issued a warning about a slowdown in demand. That warning caused Broadcom shares to plummet. You can see it down there dragging down the entire sector.</p><p>It's actually picked up a little bit, they're now down five percent. They had been down almost about eight percent. Those gloomy earnings are on that U.S.-China trade war. And of course, that Huawei export ban.</p><p>Matt Egan has been tracking all of this, what I was so interested in this was that it seemed to be the canary in the coal mine. They were, you know, dead factual about it. This is what it's going to cost us. And this is how we think it's going to spread.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: They did not mince any words here. And if you're looking for evidence of how the trade war is actually impacting business, just look at the chip makers.</p><p>Broadcom was pretty clear. They said that there's two major factors here. One is the trade war. And that is related to Huawei and the export ban on Huawei. And two is this global slowdown. And so they had some pretty negative things to say. They downgraded their outlook for the rest of the year by $2 billion dollars. To give you some context around that, that's twice as much as Bank of America had anticipated.</p><p>And they really called out that export ban on Huawei because Broadcom got about a billion dollars, almost a billion in sales last year, just from Huawei directly. And so that is a big deal for this company.</p><p>NEWTON: A big deal. And yet, it wasn't just Huawei, right? That's what I was so intrigued about. They are actually looking this totality. I mean, when we start to think about things like recessions or the true impacts of trade wars, we are really starting to see it with this company and the whole sector.</p><p>EGAN: Right. That's right, because as I said, it's only a billion dollars from Huawei, but actually, they cut the outlook by $2 billion. And they acknowledged that and so what they said was they have this broad base, slowdown in demand, and that's got to be concerning.</p><p>Now, we've seen investors knock down the shares of the rival companies, NVIDIA and Qualcomm down; Apple, which gets chips from Broadcom is down as well. And this is another piece of evidence for those people who are worried about an economic slowdown or even a recession. And there was other numbers out this morning that were disappointing, too.</p><p>China had industrial output at the slowest pace in 17 years, and you have the bond market that is still flashing all these concerns. I certainly don't envy the Federal Reserve, which of course is meeting next week and it's going to decide just how much of a rate cut signal do they want to send.</p><p>NEWTON: And how much to listen to the President's Twitter feed which we will also get to in just a few minutes. Matt, thanks so much. It is an important sector to look at. As I said, they usually get is the first indication of what's going on there.</p><p>When we come back CNN's exclusive interview. You don't want to miss this with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai. What he thinks of growing calls to break up big tech; and Amazon hitting back at 2020 hopeful, Joe Biden after the former VP takes direct aim at the taxes paid by Amazon.</p><p>[15:15:57] NEWTON: A real news making interview we have for you here. The Chief Executive of Google says he is not surprised his company is facing antitrust scrutiny. But he says he is concerned about his words here -- unintended consequences of tech regulation.</p><p>Sundar Pichai is speaking out for the first time since news broke of a potential probe into Google by the U.S. Justice Department. He sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: There's reporting that the D.O.J. is laying the foundation for a possible antitrust investigation into Google. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: No, we have always felt as a large company, we have gone through similar, you know, scrutiny in other countries, including in the U.S. before.</p><p>You know, I think it's perfectly fine that, you know, as companies get to big scale, there is scrutiny. Scale does offer many benefits. It's important to understand that. As a company, we now invest sometimes thinking five to ten years ahead without massively worrying about short term profits.</p><p>And if you -- if you think about how technology leadership directly contributes to leadership in a global economic scale, big companies are what -- who are investing in tech colleges like AI the most.</p><p>So there are many benefits, taking a long term view, you know, driving long term development, which big companies can do. But I think it's important to make sure that we are also able to create a healthy competitive ecosystem in which other companies are able to emerge.</p><p>And you know -- and that's the important question, you know, and I think scrutiny is right. And, you know, we will participate constructively in these discussions.</p><p>HARLOW: Did you expect it to come, Sundar? Or were you surprised by this news?</p><p>PICHAI: Maybe the specific timing of it. But you know, we had always expected, you know, we have gone through similar situations in Europe. And so it's not a surprise to us.</p><p>HARLOW: Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has also launched this top to bottom antitrust investigation into you and your competitors, the whole tech industry, all the big tech. And I'm interested, if that has changed any action you take within Google?</p><p>[15:20:05] HARLOW: Meaning has it changed what you and the Board are talking about? Has it made you rethink potential acquisitions for anything that may look anti-competitive?</p><p>PICHAI: You know, for Google, the scrutiny has been there for a while now. So we've always taken that into account. There have been times when we've looked at some acquisitions and said, \"Look, this is not, you know, something that may be possible.\" And so we've always taken that into consideration.</p><p>HARLOW: Because of this concern.</p><p>PICHAI: Yes, potentially, you know, making sure there's not too much concentration in a sector or so on. So-- but I think for some of the other companies, maybe the scrutiny is newer, but for us, you know, we've had this for a while.</p><p>HARLOW: You're used to it.</p><p>PICHAI: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: As you may have heard, some 2020 contenders and lawmakers think you guys and all your competitors are way too big. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 contender has even put a billboard in San Francisco talking about breaking up big tech. And she says that Google and its competitors are in her words, they have too much power. She says, you hurt small business and stifle innovation. Is she right?</p><p>PICHAI: I mean, you have to look at the actual facts. And we, first of all, as a company, we do many things. Some areas, we are upstarts. We are challenging other established companies. And so if you look across the breadth of what we do, you know, you look at every area. You look at whether there's other competition and the users have choices.</p><p>And above all, are we doing well, because we are executing well as a company or you know, and doing the right things and doing well or not. And so, you know, the details end up mattering.</p><p>And you know, so, I also think it's important that when we look at it globally, our tech companies are going to contribute to our economic growth in an important way. And we compete against other countries, other companies. And so I think it's important to keep that in mind as well.</p><p>HARLOW: It sounds like you think she's wrong.</p><p>PICHAI: I think there needs to be healthy debate, you know. Any campaign has, you know moments around that. But what matters to me is the healthy, thoughtful conversations around it.</p><p>HARLOW: Your argument about other countries and America's competitiveness is similar to an argument Mark Zuckerberg has made basically, we're going to do it or China is going do it. Is that essentially what you're saying? Don't stifle this growth in America or it will go elsewhere.</p><p>PICHAI: You know, it could you know, when being in Silicon Valley, for example, I always think, I mean, you can't take for granted that you will always be successful. I think you have to own it. You know, now there are many countries around the world, which aspire to be the next Silicon Valley, and they are supporting their companies, too.</p><p>So we have to balance both. This doesn't mean you don't scrutinize large companies, but you have to balance it with the fact that you want big successful companies as well.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, to that point, I mean, I know that you view Google as more than an American company, you view it as a global company. So are you essentially saying, look, look at us, you've even asked for regulation for rules of the road, but if we are too squeezed or broken apart, we won't hesitate to build more elsewhere.</p><p>PICHAI: It's basically -- I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences. If you take a technology like artificial intelligence, you know, it will have implications for our national security.</p><p>PICHAI: And you know and how we offer you know, other important areas of society.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: So unintended consequences, our tech expert, Shelly Palmer is here with us, I am really glad you're here to help us parse this interview. Look, we all know what's at stake here. And it's whether or not the government -- governments, I should say, not just in the United States are going to have a larger say, I'm going to preface all of this by saying you have told us for years that if you look at a company like Google, your point is that they are one of the most data rich, that means able to make money and control our lives, all of that data in the world.</p><p>In that context, what do you think of that conversation you just heard, especially when we look at the political debate right now?</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, CEO, THE PALMER GROUP: I think political debate is taking the easy populist scare everybody get everyone riled up approach. And I think that when you're explaining, you're losing, and we are going to be explaining the whole time because tech is not a sound bite.</p><p>There's no soundbite answer to that what you should do with Google or Facebook or Amazon. If you really -- I don't want you to feel bad for Google right now.</p><p>NEWTON: Don't worry, I won't.</p><p>PALMER: But with the Cannes Lions Festival starts tomorrow, and YouTube Beach has been turned into Google Beach and their entire Marketing Cloud team is there. And they are fighting for their marketing existence in a way that they never had to before.</p><p>Because when you go to buy a product right now, you are as likely to start your search on Amazon as you are to search for it in Google. This is not good for Google. So they need to answer that because a very high percentage of advertising dollars that used to exclusively go to Google and Facebook. Now they have a new competitor called Amazon.</p><p>So you're not going to care about that as a consumer, you're going to go -- they're all big tech, they should all you know be regulated. But as a turns out, there's a lot of healthy competition.</p><p>NEWTON: So your point is the market is working because they're in this American ecosystem, which in the long term works. Okay? Now, big tech regulation is obviously becoming a major talking point. I don't have to tell you in 2020 campaign, even with all of those candidates, and for the first time, it is actually a topic and this month democratic debates.</p><p>[15:25:19] NEWTON: Amazon is hitting back after Joe Biden criticized how much the company pays in taxes. I want you to have a look at this tweet with us -- in a tweet, as we said, Amazon says it has paid every penny that it owes. In fact, it says right there, Shelly, $2.6 billion.</p><p>You know, their argument is a good argument. It says, look, if you want to change the tax laws, you go to Congress, and you do it.</p><p>PALMER: By the way, there are a lot of things in tech where everyone in tech would say, if you want a different law, change the law, that's what Congress is supposed to do.</p><p>NEWTON: Because he is acting -- Joe Biden is acting like somehow they're skirting the law there.</p><p>PALMER: No, look, I think everybody, like I said, has their own agenda here. The politicians are trying to get elected. And this is the time they're trying to get elected. It's unfortunate because right at this moment, we're seeing one of the biggest technological transitions we've ever seen. And big tech is part of it. But new tech is part of it.</p><p>Sundar mentioned artificial intelligence in passing. And he said, it's going to have dramatic implications in national security and dramatic implications in economic growth.</p><p>Well, who are the big AI players? They are Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix, -- our biggest tech companies are our biggest AI players. Why? They have the most amount of data. They are data rich to use my words that you gave me back, right? They are data rich, and so they need to do something with the data and human beings can't deal with large data sets.</p><p>So yes, if you want to be a world leader in data, you're going to have to be as good as Alibaba and Tencent, or you're not going to be.</p><p>NEWTON: And this is where we get back to your point where it can't be done in a sound bite. Apparently, it can't be done in a billboard, either. I mean, look, Elizabeth Warren to name one on the Democratic field has a plan for everything. And one of her plans is this billboard.</p><p>You know, it's become a pinata. Break up big tech. It's a good slogan. Why is that dangerous, though? And I challenge you, Shelly, because for some of us, we think we cannot be too enamored with these companies. Precisely the reason that you said, competition does work, let the startups try and take on some of the big guys.</p><p>PALMER: Break up big tech would be great with specifics. And it's really easy to take something giant and put a giant target -- a big target on its back and go ahead and hit that target.</p><p>I remember just metaphorically being in Uber during the financial crisis or car service, and the guy was saying the big banks have to be broken up. And he was going through the whole thing about breaking up big banks. I said, \"How'd you buy this car?\" And he said, \"Well, I took a loan.\" I said, \"Where do you think that money came from?\"</p><p>Like the whole capital structure was lost. He just wanted to break up big banks, because that was his thing. This is that. This is take a giant shot for no reason.</p><p>If you break up Google, exactly how are you going to break it up? Will you separate search from let's say something else inside of Google? If you break up Facebook, how do you break it up? When you take the Messenger Services apart? Versus the Facebook itself? Like what would you do to break it up?</p><p>NEWTON: We have to go now, but I have to put you on the spot on this. Do you think something has to be done? Or do you think just leave it?</p><p>PALMER: I think you need to regulate because there are things that are regulatable. I'm all in favor of it, as are by the way, every single CEO in the tech business.</p><p>The question is how? Because if you over regulate, you're going to make -- just study Standard Oil, the breakup of Standard Oil. That's what's going to happen if you don't be careful with breaking up big tech.</p><p>NEWTON: You had to bring that up. I had to study that in school. You just had to bring that up. Nightmares continue. Listen, you brought up a good point about the AI. We're going to get to that in future segments on this show. It is really important as a disruptor and the Google interview proves it. Appreciate that.</p><p>Still ahead, hundreds of America's biggest brands have a warning for President Trump, find out what's in a joint letter to the White House. That's next.</p><p>[15:30:00] NEWTON: Hello, I'm Paula Newton, there's more of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment when President Trump says he's waited long enough for the Fed to cut rates. And sit, stay, trade. Shares of Chewy.com soar in their market debut, before that though, these are the headlines at this hour.</p><p>A U.S. official has told CNN that Iranian boats are preventing tugs from moving one of the tankers hit by an explosion in the Gulf of Oman. Now, the U.K. says it is now almost certain a branch of the Iranian military was responsible for the twin attacks on Thursday. Iran denies any responsibility.</p><p>Kenyan police have arrested a member of parliament for allegedly hitting a female colleague. Fatuma Gedi shared this video on social media describing how a fellow MP confronted her over a budget and struck her several times in the mouth and jaw. All female lawmakers walked out of parliament in protest as they learned of the alleged attack.</p><p>Women in Switzerland are on strike for 24 hours to try and draw attention to gender inequality and the gender pay gap. Demonstrations are taking place all over the country despite Switzerland's Gender Equality Act that passed way back in 1995.</p><p>Swiss women say they still face systemic discriminate. It's day eight, yes, of the women's football World Cup. In group D, Japan got a key win over Scotland, meantime, Italy are advancing to the last 16 after beating Jamaica 5-0. Now, England and Argentina, that will be a good one, facing off, the score right now stands at 0-0.</p><p>OK, more than 600 companies have written to the White House, warning increased tariffs on China will lead to job losses and higher prices for shoppers. Now, in a joint letter, the brand which include obviously some really big names here, Wal-Mart, Target and Gap say quote, \"an escalated trade war is not in the country's best interest and both sides will lose.</p><p>We are counting on you -- they mean the president, to force a positive resolution.\" Now, public hearings on the proposed tariffs will begin Monday. And all of this comes as China is aiming to try and drum up trade outside of the United States. President Xi has just met the Russian and Indian leaders at the Shanghai Corporation Organization Summit, it's a key forum for central Asian, economic and security issues.</p><p>Robert Lawrence Kuhn is a long-time adviser to Chinese leaders and the author of \"How China's Leaders Think\", and we have you here again to get some insight. You have just returned from China. When we take a step here and look at the escalation in the trade war recently, what do you think is at stake now and what do you think will get China to move to a place of compromise?</p><p>ROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN, AUTHOR &amp; LONG-TERM ADVISER TO CHINA'S LEADERS: The double irony here is that everything the U.S. asked for is in China's best interest. Intellectual property rights protection, opening up of markets, reduction of subsidies on enterprises, et cetera. Second irony is that the U.S. and China trade negotiators have pretty much reached agreement on most of the substance.</p><p>[15:35:00] On the intellectual property rights, China passed a law that now reduces the requirements of forced technology transfer and joint ventures. The problem has been on the -- on the enforcement and the public perception of what it means. What the U.S. is assisting and what China wants to do privately.</p><p>So we have this double frustration because tariffs are terrible for everyone, it reduces the economic efficiency. And by President Trump recently saying he's going to put 25 percent tariffs on $300 billion more if Xi Jinping doesn't show up, really puts China in a very awkward place. A lesser leader than President Xi would have had to reject that just because he would lose so much in his own perception. Fortunately, President Xi is strong enough that hopefully he'll be able to overcome that and meet the President Trump.</p><p>NEWTON: And all this is incredibly complicated, as all of this has been going on, Robert, as you know, we had those protests in Hong Kong. Now, Beijing has been in the center of that story this week, those protests as were saying, China has summoned the U.S. envoy over quote, these -- its quote, \"irresponsible remarks\" made about that controversial Extradition Bill with Beijing saying it will not accept, and it says the United States is meddling in Hong Kong affairs. Listen, you just said it that it takes someone of the strength of Xi to kind of get through this.</p><p>And yet, when you look at the Hong Kong protests, and you look at so many people including Secretary of State Pompeo said quite concretely, we stand on the side of democracy.</p><p>KUHN: Sure.</p><p>NEWTON: How does this all get resolved when you've got so much at stake on the state?</p><p>KUHN: Let's understand why Hong Kong is so important to Beijing. First of all, economically, it is -- it has been the window to the world, but that has changed with the growth of Shanghai and Shenzhen and other areas. But now Hong Kong is the lynch pin of what's called the Greater Base Strategy, which is an integration of Hong Kong and Macau with the major cities in Guangdong Province.</p><p>Together, they have about 12 percent of the Chinese GDP, about $1.5 trillion, if that were a country alone, it would be in the top 15 in the world.</p><p>NEWTON: The number is staggering --</p><p>KUHN: So, it's the -- it's the center of the -- China's economy and the idea of regional coordination, they're doing it in the Yangtze River around Shanghai and north with Beijing, Tianjin and the new city of Shanghai. So, there are three areas, but this is the big one, you know, around the Bay area -- the Greater Bay area.</p><p>So, Hong Kong is critical to make that happen in many different ways, technology, logistics, et cetera. There are two other reasons, one is that this is a demonstration of the Chinese method of governance, and third, it's an expression of national pride. So that puts that at the highest level of significance, especially at this time in the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic. So, those are the stakes.</p><p>NEWTON: And let's be clear, Robert, they believe that system of governance is superior. Closely --</p><p>KUHN: No question, and the great majority of the people think the same. That doesn't mean it's perfect, and there's a lot of people who complain about no access to the internet and different thing, but bottom line, people's lives are better --</p><p>NEWTON: OK, but --</p><p>KUHN: Eight hundred million people have been lifted out of poverty --</p><p>NEWTON: OK, but --</p><p>KUHN: People see that.</p><p>NEWTON: We're not talking about -- perfect though, we're talking about repressive, which is a completely different issue. But we had an interesting issue come up, the global chief economist of UBS has been put on leave over a phrase and it was incisive(ph), in a phrase used and he said that, he apologized. He was discussing consumer prices in China and Paul Donovan had attributed higher price to quote, \"sick pigs\" which was interpreted by some as a slur. Now, he as I said apologized. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL DONOVAN, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I apologize for anyone who took any offense from my remarks which were clearly not intended to offend. I got it wrong, I made a mistake and I wittingly used hugely, culturally, insensitive language.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: And yet, this is even from the group -- from groups of financiers and securing these people in Hong Kong. They're saying we don't want any part of UBS anymore. They are taking a stand, and yet not taking a stand on what's going on in Hong Kong with the extradition treaty. Can you explain that to me?</p><p>KUHN: You know, this goes well beyond China culture. This is a human tendency. We all have a sense -- it's based on an evolutionary process of in-group and out-group. And we're always more willing to accept physical abnormalities or problems if -- in order to elevate our pride. That is just the case.</p><p>And this is a -- this is perceived as an attack on Chinese pride. We see that everywhere in all human societies. And so, that is the most sensitive thing. That gets people's emotions the highest. And that's what they're reacting to. They're reacting to the simple, cultural in and out group situation. I wouldn't read more into it than that.</p><p>NEWTON: Having said that, I've got to go, but quickly, you just returned from China, hopeful about the tariff talks or not?</p><p>KUHN: You know, I look for hope in strange things. China published --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>[15:40:00] China published an aggressive -- an attack against the U.S. after the U.S. attacked China for back-tracking, and China went after. I look upon that and -- positively, because now China is setting an equal thing. it's not that the U.S. has been attacking them and they're -- now, the attack is equal.</p><p>So there are an equal position. They had a phrase in that document which was important. They basically said that China has said publicly and strongly that it will abide by anything that they agree to --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>KUHN: Including intellectual property protection, and therefore the kind of restrictions that the U.S. was wanting to do in terms of laws would be exceedingly an offense to their dignity. And so, if the U.S. would trust China -- it's a bad word, I know -- but you can always go back. But China is going on record to say --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>KUHN: They will -- they will agree.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, Robert, thank you so much again --</p><p>KUHN: Good to see you.</p><p>NEWTON: Up next, President Trump tears into the Fed yet again, and the chairman he picked, Jerome Powell. He says he's waited long enough for a rate cut. We'll explain when we come back.</p><p>NEWTON: President Trump is not about to stop bashing the Federal Reserve. Did we think it was going to be any other way? And he'll continue to pressure the U.S. Central Bank to cut rates, a point he made incredibly clear to \"ABC's\" George Stephanopoulos. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was my pick and I disagree with him entirely, I'm not happy with what he's done, I'm not happy with the fact that they've done quantitative tightening. If we --</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, TELEVISION JOURNALIST: Even concerned you're putting him in a --</p><p>TRUMP: Let me explain, yes, I do, but I'm going to do it anyway because I've waited long enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Just so unorthodox. The president may have that wish granted very soon. Investors put the probability of an interest rate cut by the end -- I want to remind everyone, it wasn't that long ago we were talking about interest rate rise. OK, you got that 90 percent according to the CME groups Fed watch tool.</p><p>Clare, I am absolutely taken aback by the fact that he continues. And to me, it almost seems like he's getting his way because as if the Fed is listening somehow.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN REPORTER: Well, I mean, the Fed wouldn't want you to think that because the minute the market thinks that they're bowing to the president's pressure, that's when they lose credibility. But the bottom line is, they are starting to signal that this could be in play, not just July, but possibly even June, that's about a 25 percent probability the market thinks there will be a rate cut in June. So, this could be happening as soon as next week.</p><p>There's a lot of data out there, not just the jobs report that was weak last week, there's manufacturing, there's construction. There are signs of slowing and that's what they're reacting to.</p><p>[15:45:00] But this would be an interest rate cut like you see in a downturn. This is what they call an insurance, this is something to shore up confidence, something to try and avert a faster downturn. So, that's what we're possibly looking at here. But it's still not a good sign, it's still not a sign that President Trump's economy is doing what he calls necessities which is growing at the fastest rate, you know, we've seen in years.</p><p>This is a sign of something that's a fit in the economy.</p><p>NEWTON: Well, when you look at kind of the factors that they're bringing into it, you know, we had Matt Egan here talking about Broadcom and the chip sector --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right --</p><p>NEWTON: Is that trade war, you think starting to slide? Do you see those indicators starting to slide in the economy, and that's why Powell wants this insurance.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The trade war is a conundrum because there's direct impact which haven't seen to its full effect yet, because so far the 25 percent tariff right there only comes into effect this weekend. The 10 percent was broadly manageable if we get another set of tariffs and the remaining --</p><p>NEWTON: He says he might do --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Kinds impose $300 million, then that really will start to see macro impact. But it's not just direct, it's also confidence, like we could talk ourselves into a recession through fears over the trade wars, through businesses not being able to invest in things, not being able to expand, holding back on plans even when it comes to hiring. But we talk a lot about how businesses can't deal with this uncertainty, I think the same applies to the Fed. How are they supposed to know what to do when any minute, the trade war could escalate or the trade war could be rolled back?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, you make such a good point, that is such a good point. If you're sitting there and you're Chairman Powell, that is what you're weighing --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right --</p><p>NEWTON: As well, because you're dealing with a completely different set of economic principles coming out of the White House.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Great.</p><p>NEWTON: Clare, thanks so much, we'll continue talking about it. The economy will be a huge talking point as Clare and I will know for the 2020 campaign trail, but so will, of course, abortion. Top executives from more than 180 companies have a message for lawmakers restricting abortion is in their words bad for business.</p><p>Executives from H&amp;M, Tinder, Slack and Yelp among many others recently took out a full page ad in the \"New York Times\", saying that it's time for companies to stand up for reproductive healthcare. Now, Richard spoke about the issue with corporate social responsibility expert Susan McPherson; founder and CEO of McPherson Strategies.</p><p>Now, she welcomes the move, but says more needs to be done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSAN MCPHERSON, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, MCPHERSON STRATEGIES: Well, this -- I look at this as the last kind of straw for corporations. We've seen companies step up to fight for proper gun use. We've seen them fight for LGBTQ equality. We've seen them galvanize around climate change issues, but we had yet to see them step up for women's access to reproductive healthcare.</p><p>So, this was the natural next step that we saw companies take.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN: Right, but this is in many ways different.</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: From the others.</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Because you can be for LGBTQ, transgender bathrooms, all those other issues --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Many in the population don't feel strongly one way or the other.</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: But there's a large number of men and women who are pro-life who are not in favor of termination. And they may resent companies doing it.</p><p>MCPHERSON: Well, they may resent companies, but it's a much smaller number than you'd think. Seven in ten, actually support Roe v. Wade as it stands right now. But more importantly, companies believe in equality for their employees and equal access to jobs. And if something that's going to prevent a woman from going to work, that puts them at a difficult situation.</p><p>QUEST: But this is a highly --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Oh, absolutely --</p><p>QUEST: Controversial issue --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: That is dividing a large number of people. And I wonder whether -- what is -- what is the responsibility of a company in this situation? They don't like to get involved --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: In high controversy.</p><p>MCPHERSON: No, I couldn't agree more. And as somebody who's worked with companies for 30-plus years, I know that. However, when you have individuals in these states that would miss work for a week, it causes problems with productivity. And so companies are looking at it through the lens of economics and through productivity. And quite frankly, this causes challenges in the day-to-day operations of companies.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that -- it's fine to sign a letter --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: But ultimately, what we saw with transgender bathrooms in Carolinas --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Was, you had to threaten to leave. You had --</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: To withdraw jobs.</p><p>MCPHERSON: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: We know Bob Iger of Disney has said, look, we will remove movie- making or some of it from Georgia. What do you hope will happen?</p><p>MCPHERSON: Well, I hope -- well, what we hope -- excuse me, what I hope will happen is that this will open up companies to the importance that this plays in the economics of the business. And yes, the stronger the companies can be, what is going to change the leaders' minds in those states, then let them do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:50:00] NEWTON: OK, Chewy starts trading on Wall Street, it's the third IPO this week, we'll tell you how the latest unicorn plans to deliver goods.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, I can't promise this will be a pun-free zone, but Chewy.com is delivering --</p><p>(DOOR BELL)</p><p>(DOG BARKING)</p><p>Something new. The company has everything, yes, orthopedic dog beds, ferret leashes, cat clothes -- no one needs cat clothes, I'm just saying -- even a protective mask for your horse. Now, they're offering investment returns as well. Shares are way up on the first day of trading, I mean, way up.</p><p>Investors have had big helpings of the market this week with three IPOs, not just one. Now, Chewy, OK, Chewy, up some 60 percent since Friday morning. Just this morning. Fiverr debuted Thursday, it climbed 90 percent on the first day and crowd strike started trading on Monday, it rallied more than 70 percent.</p><p>Ryan Cohen is the founder of Chewy. Ryan, look, I am telling you, I would have never been a person to invest in your start-up ever. You look at pets.com, you look at -- they went out of business and you look at what Amazon is doing, why are you doing well in the market? What's happening here?</p><p>RYAN COHEN, FOUNDER, CHEWY: Yes, well, I think the world has changed a lot from, you know, the days of Pets.com until today. And so, you know, the market back then was underpenetrated, people weren't shopping online. Today e-commerce is a way of life. People are scared just to put their credit card information online.</p><p>Then also, you have the humanization of pets and people have, you know, moved up market. And so ASP is in the margin structure has moved up. And then you just have the shipping density where shipping as a percentage of revenue is a lot less today than it was in the past.</p><p>And so, we've really built the business where this is a category that focus is incredibly important, and so, you know, we do all that fly wheel of fast shipping, price, being competitive, that's all -- you know, basically table stakes in e-commerce. But then when it comes to being the category experts, right? You want to know what's the best weight loss foods. Great and free foods, you call us and we know the product better than anyone else, we're the best in the business.</p><p>NEWTON: You know, when you started this, so come on, you had to have the skeptics lined up around the door and not so many investors thinking -- Ryan, you've got to be kidding me, this isn't going to work.</p><p>COHEN: We didn't have any investors, I mean, I went to Silicon Valley, it took me over two years to finance the business, over a 100 investors passed, lots of \"Nos\", you know, at the demise of Pets.com, going head-to- head against them is on and vertically integrated e-commerce.</p><p>[15:55:00] But we kept on scaling the business, so we just heads down, blocking, tackling, focusing on amazing execution. And I think everyone underestimated how well we would execute and how big of a business we can build.</p><p>NEWTON: You're still going up against Amazon.com.</p><p>COHEN: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NEWTON: That is a confident man, people, yes. So, what -- because you know they're looking at you and thinking, no, they're not taking any piece of our pet business.</p><p>COHEN: Yes, I mean, the vision for the company was really to replicate the experience I had in a neighborhood pet store, but do it online and do it at scale. And so, you know, the handwritten holiday cards from the beginning, the pet portraits, the flowers, doing all these things to really delight our customers and show our customers we're bringing a face to e-commerce.</p><p>And within a category like pet where pets -- where customers are so fanatical, all of those small things just create this loyalty, and once customers shop at Chewy, they continue shopping at Chewy and they tell all their friends and family about this incredible experience.</p><p>NEWTON: But they're very low barriers to entry and you know people will fickle about where to shop. If you just look at how many times people change their pets food, it's dizzying.</p><p>COHEN: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: Do you worry at this point in time that, you know, yes, the market looks like this year. What makes you think the market will be there next year?</p><p>COHEN: I mean, it's really -- it's just a game of scale within e-commerce. And so, you need enough revenues to get your fixed cost, you need enough velocity with your suppliers. You need enough fulfillment centers --</p><p>NEWTON: And you think you're there?</p><p>COHEN: I mean, Chewy has seven fulfillment centers, 11 million active customers, the 3.5 billion in revenue in 2018, so if you wanted to replicate that model, sure, with enough capital, it's possible, but it would require significantly more capital than we had invested into the business.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, there are some crazy things you can buy at Chewy.com for people who are with me with pets and spend way too much money.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But we will continue to really track your development and also the IPO markets which has been --</p><p>COHEN: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: Extraordinary this week, appreciate it, Ryan.</p><p>COHEN: Thank you, thank you for having me.</p><p>NEWTON: Just few more minutes left on that trade on Wall Street, we will have those final numbers for you right after this.</p><p>NEWTON: Well, it's not as flat as a pancake, but pretty close, that's what we're dealing with on the Dow. It is trying to cling on to any gain it could eke out here, but no, it's just flat. The key thing here though is that we're up half a percent for the week. Tech and energy shares though are down for the day.</p><p>And that is it for me and the markets as you see, we will end on a down day there. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton in New York. The news continues right here on CNN.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019061401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WBN-H0N1-JB20-G19D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 14, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For some, the sheer number of bills, combined with the proven inertia of Congress, spells a long and fruitless period of debate. For others, it seems proof that Congress is finally preparing to take some action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is no straightforward, \"it-passes-or-it-doesn't\" game. There are three classes of legislation up for consideration. The first group deals with politically safe issues such as tax credits for rural broadband deployment. This part of reform is almost a slam-dunk; nobody will oppose it. The second group is aimed at slapping the Bells harder for noncompliance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The third group concerns letting the Bells into the data services market with fewer or no restrictions. How these last two groups of bills might fare in Congress is the question I'll try to answer.</p><p>First, it's likely that there will be at least a vote on some substantive reform. The telecom and networking industry has been the fuel driving the whole tech sector, and technology is the fuel behind the economy. We can't really hope for recovery without a big tech rebound, and we can't get that without some real advance in networking's fortunes. High-tech executives have been telling Congress that story, and congressional leaders will probably listen.</p><p>Second, it's certain that if anything emerges from Congress, it will be a compromise of the \"carrot-and-stick\" nature. The Bells want relief from the wholesaling and unbundling requirements of the telecom act in the data services area - that's what the Tauzin Bill, the much-debated House measure, would offer. Bell opponents, mostly the interexchange carriers and supporters of the surviving competitive local exchange carriers, want the penalties for Bell foot-dragging in complying with competitive requirements of the telecom act to be increased. Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), Senate commerce committee chairman and chief antiBell player, wants to use the threat of breaking up the Bells into a wholesale and retail component as a \"punishment of last resort\" for regional Bell operating companies intransigence. It wouldn't take a genius to craft a bill that would do both, and that's probably what will happen.</p><p>What's left out of this compromise? Probably us. We're in our current mess because Congress forgot about the data market when drafting the telecom act. They're now remembering data, but forgetting that there are many kinds of data. The critical questions of today will be answered by accident, just the way the telecom act \"accidentally\" answered how data services were to be regulated: just like voice. What that may do is make even a regulatory change less than completely effective in bringing about the kind of industry we want.</p><p>The bills don't address DSL infrastructure support, voice over DSL, streaming video or fiber to the home. Will we have very high bit rate DSL after asymmetric DSL? Will SONET be phased out, pared back, or grow? Is there a hope for voice over IP? None of these questions are really addressed in any of the pending legislation. Might something substantive be introduced in amendments? Sure and, as an old relative of mine used to say, \"If fish had feet, they'd be mice.\" Congress has no track record of dealing with telecom details like that, and yet it will be the details that will determine the shape of the market.</p><p>We're going to start, in the next year or so, on a capital buildout for new-generation services that will cost about a quarter-trillion dollars. Do you think if we get it less than just right because of regulatory oversights, we'll get to go back to Wall Street for more money and just do it over? We're stuck with the \"network of the future\" for the foreseeable future, and the makeup of that network will be decided by little legal nuances in legislation, created as often by accident as by design.</p><p>This is a lousy way to try to save an industry, but I'm behind it. I'll smile at Hollings, shake hands with Tauzin, and kiss all the other congressional babies. I'll overlook the tired politics, the \"accidental\" solutions because bad as this may be, it will be better than nothing.</p><p>Nolle is president of CIMI Corp., a technology assessment firm in Voorhees, N.J.

We need one law.\" Attorney and AT&amp;T veteran Robert Quinn at Wilkinson Barker, agreed. \"If you don't have a federal law, you're going to have 45 state laws.\" If the issue isn't addressed, he told the Phoenix Center, \"that's a fail for the federal government.\"</p><p>Wilson will continue to resist any \"hipster antitrust\" arguments about telecom competition or big-tech breakups. \"I think about how we weigh the benefits of a merger in addition to the costs.\" She said few people within her agency want to return to the days when the FTC was considered \"America's nanny.\"</p><p>Consumers can no longer assume privacy is an expectation online, said NCTA Chief-Government Relations Joanna McIntosh. \"We have no privacy and we are free to be monetized in every way possible.\" McIntosh backed middle-ground legislation between no privacy and complete transparency from industry. The stakes go beyond a company's tracking customer purchasing habits and sending annoying advertisements, she suggested: \"This is not about red shoes. It's about how you're going to vote in an election. It's about how you feel about social issues.\"</p><p>Consumer data handling entails risk management, said Shane Tews, American Enterprise Institute visiting fellow. But privacy \"is something you have to decide emotionally how you're going to manage.\" She would like consumers to regain control over their own data and how it's used to target them with content. \"I don't mind having someone target ads to me,\" she said. \"I'd just like to have some control over it. Is there a way to introduce some humanity into the equation?\"</p><p>Net neutrality will likely get more debate among federal regulators, speakers predicted. Quinn expects the judiciary to remand the issue to the FCC (see 1902060036): \"Courts do the easy thing. They punt all the time.\" He doesn't believe the current commissioners would be happy to relitigate the matter: \"It's not clear whether the FCC wants to scale that wall again.\" Quinn said the only true answer to net neutrality is legislation. \"If you get a Democratic Congress in 2020, they'll put it back in a nanosecond.\" He said it would be difficult for federal agencies to regulate net neutrality without legislation to back it up. \"Reasonable people 10 years ago could have come up with a solution,\" he said. \"We didn't make it happen.\"</p><p>One way or the other, net neutrality is probably headed back to the FCC, said McIntosh. \"It's a zombie issue\" and a wedge issue that politicians can use to raise money, she said.</p><p>Phoenix Center President Lawrence Spiwak urged policymakers to find a way to move spectrum from low-value to high-value use. McIntosh said in the move to build out 5G broadband networks there will be conflicts on how to repurpose spectrum from incumbents not just to core facility holders but for Wi-Fi. \"We need more spectrum for Wi-Fi,\" Quinn agreed. But moving stakeholders away from their existing spectrum licenses takes money. \"Somebody's got to pay for that,\" Quinn said. \"Moving people is costly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF2-G3D1-DYRJ-052Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Frank[1] Lobbyists have a bad name for good reason. Activist Post has reported before about telecom and tech companies spending beaucoup bucks to sway elected officials and government employees to force the installation of risky technology - including utility 'Smart' Meters[2] and 5G[3] - in communities across the U.S. (see 1[4], 2[5], 3[6], 4[7], 5[8]). Thanks to Comparitech.com for providing more nauseating details in this recent article, 'How much does your ISP spend on lobbying?'</p><p>[9] Comparitech researchers compiled and analyzed 51 ISPs' lobbying expenses from the US Senate's Lobbying Disclosure Act database, which dates back to 1998. Here are the highlights of our analysis: 2018 was the biggest year yet for ISP lobbying at $80 million. Top spenders include AT...Verizon, and Comcast, which have amassed lobbying expenses of $341 million, $265 million, and $200 million, respectively since 1998. Since 2011, yearly spending on lobbying across all ISPs hasn't strayed below $72 million. The largest amount spent by any provider in any year was AT...n 1999, at almost $23 million. AT... acquisition of Ameritech Corp[10] accounted for much of this, and the merger eventually led to the creation of America's largest telecom company. Total spend from 2016 to 2019 is set to exceed lobbying expenses between 2012 and 2015, which totaled $295 million. Lobbying in favor of mergers and acquisitions accounted for many of the biggest expenses for individual ISPs in a single year. $1.2 billion has been spent by ISPs on lobbying since 1998. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ISP-lobbying.jpgRegister\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ISP-lobbying.jpgRegister</url> Now for The 5G Crisis: Awareness ...countability Summit.

Regulators have also pushed that trend, as they look to attain universal 5G coverage quickly, and want to ensure traditional not-spots are reached by the new technology.<table><title>5G Network-Sharing Agreements</title><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Date</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Country</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operators</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>18-Apr</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>South Korea</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>All three mobile operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG U+) and SK Broadband</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>18-Dec</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Sweden</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Tele2 and Telenor</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Jan</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>UK</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Vodafone and O2</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Feb</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Italy</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Vodafone and TIM</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Apr</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Spain</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Vodafone and Orange</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Jun</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Italy</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>WindTre and FastWeb</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Jun</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Latvia/Lithuania</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Tele2 and Bite</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Jul</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Belgium</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Orange and Proximus</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Jul</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Japan</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>SoftBank and KDDI</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Sep</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>China</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>China Telecom and China Unicom</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Oct</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Spain</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Masmovil and Orange</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Nov</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Germany</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica and Vodafone</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>19-Dec</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Malaysia</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Maxis and Celcom</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: Fitch Solutions   The second trend relates to spectrum. It is true that in many regions, specifically Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, 5G will take some time to launch before the regulators make the right frequencies available to operators. But new models of licensing have also emerged, with an eye towards its use for industries. The German regulator was the first to reserve a quarter of its frequencies in the 3.4-3.8GHz band for local use, and the autos industry has been quick to take advantage, rolling out private networks, where manufacturers can exert greater control, in some of their factories. This is not a path the French regulator has followed, arguing that industry was not ready yet for 5G, while some operators are looking at alternatives, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3 Sweden</emphasis> with its partnership with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ukkoverkot</emphasis>, where some of its frequencies will be leased for private applications.A second idea is the one of spectrum sharing, where multiple applications will be using the same frequencies, based on their location and length of use. The UK's Ofcom is the leading European regulator in this trend, having decided to make the 3.8-4.2GHz, 1,800MHz, 2,300MHz and 26GHz bands available for sharing, on the assumption that the higher the frequencies, the easier they are to share, because it is easier to manage interference and to roll them out for localised use. The FCC in the US is also leading, with its plans to auction the CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) band in 2020. Sharing will be based on three tiers, with the incumbents at the top, the Priority Access License (PAL) in the middle, where frequencies will be allocated through a 2020 auction, and the General Authorized Access (GAA) at the bottom. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis>  5G: First An Evolution, Then A Revolution, April 9 2019 3 Sweden Offers Alternative To Avoid Spectrum Bottleneck, May 30 2019 Germany 5G Auction: Limited Spectrum And Competition Drive Bids Up, June 13 2019 Autos At Forefront Of Industrial 5G With Mercedes Deal, June 20 2019 More Network-Sharing Expected In European 5G Market, July 12 2019 Network Sharing Agreement To Boost China's 5G Rollout, August 28 2019 5G Will Underpin The Healthcare Revolution, October 11 2019  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4IR Efforts Begin To Take Shape</emphasis> As already noted, we believe 5G will be a key enabler of 4IR developments, but it will not be the only disruptive technology available to industries. The private sector, together with governments are beginning to understand what disruptive technologies are, and the need for these technologies to be interconnected to generate greater value. We believe that this will lead to continued government interest in 4IR initiatives, as the need to drive productivity gains from technological advancement becomes apparent, given that capital deepening and increases in labour become increasingly unreliable growth drivers.Through 2019, technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, 5G, cloud, and blockchain have continued to feature prominently in national growth plans, and governments have been doubling down on programmes to subsidise and invest into these new technologies. We expect this trend to accelerate in 2020, as new networks built on these disruptive technologies begin to proliferate.While interest in 4IR initiatives across both developing and developed economies is strong, there will no doubt to be a divergence between the plans of both sets of countries in the short term. In developed markets, the relatively high availability of advanced communications infrastructure and the maturity of the policy environment will enable the exploration of new, advanced monetisable use-cases, such as autonomous driving, while in developing countries, the use of the new technologies will be limited. While countries at all points within the developmental spectrum will draw up ambitious 4IR plans, successful implementation will be contingent on other factors, including the legal environment, the trade environment, and the economic climate.Alongside initiatives, regulation will continue to be a key sticking point in 2020, much like it was in 2019, when there was a strong focus on cybersecurity and data privacy. While these two areas will receive continued focus, more deep-seated issues surrounding disruptive technologies, such as the ethical development of AI, could become an area of concern for regulators. Lawmakers will be forced to balance dual objectives: sustained economic growth, and the obligation to advance AI in a responsible manner. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis>  Telcos Look At Edge Computing, But Risks Remain High, November 14 2019 Quick View: Quantum Computing To Have The Biggest Tech Impact, If It Really Exists, October 24 2019 What Our Clients Want To Know: The Fourth Industrial Revolution, October 2 2019 Regulation Part Of Global Tech Battle, June 12 2019 <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"536\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Different Factors Will Contribute To Success Of 4IR </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Global - Selected 4IR Index Scores</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file20150DSgUwxyUd939\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Fitch Solutions Fourth Industrial Revolution Maturity Index </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disruptive Technologies And Regulation</emphasis> Globally, development of smarter infrastructures using disruptive technology will be driven by corporates, in turn driven by their own agendas. This will not always mean that such activities will be undertaken with wider societal and economic considerations in mind. We therefore expect ro see in 2020 greater government focus on developing regulatory frameworks which will govern smart infrastructures. Key issues which will increasingly be brought to the fore will centre on data collection and management as well as privacy.New and emerging technologies continue to advance at a faster pace than regulation. On one hand, this relative freedom has provided a supportive environment for players to innovate and develop. However, looking forward this will increasingly become a hindrance for global tech players. We expect the challenges of the lack of uniformity in regulation of key technologies, with regulation largely playing out at national level, will weigh heavily on players who are becoming increasingly internationally focused necessitating compliance across a number of jurisdictions. Regulators will also continue to seek ways to rein in Big Tech, as well as ensuring that the rules have global application, as evidenced by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>'s case which sought to limit the European Court of Justice's ruling around the deletion of illegal content to the EU only.Digital services taxation will also remain a focus in 2020 as authorities will continue to grapple with methods to ensure a fair taxation system which includes the growing number of digital players. As global regulators move towards a more harmonious approach, they will look to expand on the G7's consensus on taxing digital companies, notwithstanding their physical presence being in another member country, to achieve the approval of the G20 and work towards developing a roadmap for taxation.In terms of digital financial services, we believe fintech players will face better opportunities to scale and innovate in markets which have prioritised the establishment of supportive regulatory environments, while markets characterised by relatively inflexible regulation will see weaker growth. We also expect <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>'s plans to launch its cryptocurrency <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Libra </emphasis> to face heavy opposition, key concerns will be around risks Libra poses to traditional currencies, the risk of abuse of its systems, as well as Facebook's trustworthiness following a number of highly publicised controversies. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis>  Quick View: Wide International Agreement Required For Digital Services Tax To Work, July 19 2019 Quick View: BA's Fine Shows That GDPR Is Not Only For Tech Companies, July 9 2019 Quick View: Growing Tension Between Global Tech Companies And National Regulation, October 3 2019 Drone Construction Dividend Contingent On Supportive Regulatory Environment, October 7 2019 Thailand Fintech: Proactive Regulators To Support Industry Growth, June 7 2019 India Fintech: Strict Regulation Could Impede Sector Growth, September 27 2019 Quick View: Growing Tension Between Global Tech Companies And National Regulation, October 3 2019 Regulation Part Of Global Tech Battle, June 12 2019 Digital Taxes In Asia: Recent Developments, Implications And Challenges, April 10 2019 Sub-Saharan Africa Mobile Financial Services: Key Drivers Of Potential And Risk, March 27 2019  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Streaming To Continue To Shape The Media Industry</emphasis> So far, our year ahead assessment has largely focused on the enterprise or industrial impact of new technologies. But these advances are also being leveraged to develop new entertainment-based content propositions for consumers and the media sector will be a major user of disruptive technology in 2020 and beyond. For the year ahead, we expect streaming to be the key theme in the media industry, with competition set to increase and new services scheduled to be launched. The streaming trend will dominate the video, gaming and music segments, powered by shifting consumer habits and better mobile connectivity standards (eg: 5G).In the video streaming market, the streaming wars have begun. Incumbent <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis> will face a more crowded marketplace, with new rivals both at a global and local scale. Content and pricing as well as consumer interface and viewer engagement tools will be key to succeed. That said, we believe Netflix will still retain a key advantage, namely having both tech and entertainment know-how. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis> has the former, but not the latter, while large media companies lack a solid tech expertise. Disney+'s technical problems on the day of launch are testimony of this as well as the fact that thousands of its customers' accounts were hacked in the first week of the service being live. Disney+'s biggest draw so far has been its original Star Wars TV serial, The Mandalorian; with a relatively short run of episodes and little other original material based on major established titles to sustain interest, the new player could easily lose customers in the longer term.An interesting development to watch will be the launch of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quibi</emphasis> in April 2020. The service, the name of which is short for 'quick bites', will be a mobile-exclusive streaming service offering premium content with a length of under ten minutes. Long shows will be divided into short chapters, with the service conceived to be appealing to millennials and used on-the-go on mobile devices, as 5G will potentially boost this type of video consumption. Quibi - founded by former Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman and former Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg - could therefore intensify the streaming competition also 'outside the living room', betting on the fact that mobile streaming will find a large audience also in developed markets. The service counts notable investors, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disney</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sony</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BBC</emphasis>, and has already sold its USD150mn advertisement inventory for the first year. Netflix - which already has mobile-only subscriptions in India and Malaysia - and other streaming players could double down on their mobile offerings and produce new content to be consumed specifically on the go, should Quibi prove successful.With more viewers shifting to streaming - and advertisers with them - traditional linear broadcasters will face lower revenue. Some established players are looking to fight back by launching their own OTT platforms with localised content - examples include BritBox in the UK and Salto in France. We believe that sporting content will be vital for broadcaster to retain pay-TV viewers, although broadcasting rights will be extremely expensive. That said, some streaming players already have sports in their crosshairs, with Disney leveraging <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESPN+</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> having secured rights for a limited number of Premier League matches in the UK. Furthermore, the low latency provided by 5G will enhance viewers' experience in streaming sport events, eliminating any delay.Streaming will be a key theme also in gaming and music. As for the former, 2020 will see some important launches of cloud gaming services, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>'s Project xCloud, following <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> Stadia's launch in November 2019. Telecoms operators are also looking for opportunities in this market, although we expect Microsoft and Sony to remain best positioned, especially following their partnership in May 2019. That said, we believe cloud gaming to still be in its early days; thus it will take time, beyond 2020, for the segment to fully mature.As for music, we expect podcasts' momentum to persist, with possible further investment to strengthen this type of offering. A considerable development would be the launch of a new music streaming service by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Tiktok </emphasis>'s parent company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bytedance</emphasis>. Reportedly, Bytedance is already in talks with large record labels and will initially focus on emerging markets, intensifying the competition for players like Spotify in developing countries, where large, young populations promise lucrative opportunities. TikTok's user base, reportedly of more than 1bn users, will be a key asset in fostering the uptake of the new service. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Video</emphasis>  Price And Content Could Soon Be Joined By A Third Key Aspect In Deciding Streaming Players' Success, October 30 2019 Netflix To Increase International Focus Amid Rising Headwinds In The Domestic Market, October 17 2019 OTT Streaming Continues To Erode Thailand Pay-TV Operator Revenues, August 27 2019 An Accurate Strategy Key For ViacomCBS To Succeed, August 16 2019 Quick View: Netflix's Emerging Market Strategy A Risky Gamble, July 19 2019 South Africa Pay-TV: Multichoice Overstates Netflix Threat, Regulator Underestimates Content-Restriction Impact, May 30 2019 Quick View: Breadth And Depth Will See Disney+ Beat Netflix In Children's Content, May 13 2019 Interactive Content An Appealing Opportunity For Media Players, May 2 2019 Content Deals Show Malaysia Pay-TV Market's Future Is In Streaming, April 29 2019 Disney Has Netflix In Its Crosshairs', April 15 2019 The BBC And Discovery Preparing To Challenge OTT Streaming Players In The UK And Around The World, April 3 2019 Competition To Heat Up In The French Video Streaming Market, March 18 2019 BritBox: Pricing, Content Breadth And Relevance To Challenge UK's New Streaming Video Platform, March 1 2019 Hulu: Limited Risks From Price-Cuts As US Streaming Video Market Heats Up, January 25 2019  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gaming</emphasis>SK Telecom - Microsoft Cloud Gaming Partnership Highlights Importance Of 5G, September 4 2019 Telcos Look To Cloud Gaming With Different Strategies, August 22 2019 Sony-Microsoft Partnership To Reinforce Gaming Dominance, Opens New Consumer AI Possibilities For Microsoft, May 17 2019 Quick View: Google Enters Gaming, But Strong Competition Afoot, March 20 2019  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Music</emphasis>  Quick View: Spotify To Double Down On Emerging Markets With Lite App, July 9 2019 Google And Amazon Use Music Streaming To Boost Home Speakers And Subscriptions, April 26 2019 Localised Content And Costs Key Criteria For Africa Music Streaming Uptake, April 11 2019 Podcasts The Next Hit For Spotify, March 28 2019 Music Streaming In India The Next Big Hit, March 14 2019  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sustainability To Drive Investment And Strategy Decisions</emphasis> The topic of sustainability came forcefully to the fore in 2019 and as concerns regarding climate change and environmental degradation are coalescing around the notion of a global climate emergency, we expect TMT companies to be subjected to greater scrutiny regarding sourcing, production and dispersal of products and services in 2020 and beyond.Setting aside the question of the sustainability of the consumer electronics sector - where single-use non-recvclable plastics and chemicals account for a high proportion of a device's construction and manufacturing process and have long been under the spotlight for improvement - we believe there will be a growing awareness on the part of the tech sector to improve energy usage and lower carbon emissions before consumer and investor backlash can taint their all-important brand reputations. Improved operational costs deriving from such initiatives will be a secondary, but still important consideration.The telecoms sector, in particular, has come in for considerable criticism in 2019, as older networks were never really designed with power utilisation efficiency (PUE) and zero-emission standards in mind. This extends up to and including the latest 4G and fibre networks, with cell towers often using fossil fuel-powered national electricity grids and/or diesel generators and fibre networks powered also generally powered by local electricity grids. Renewable power sources are available, but are not always located close enough to the networks or are reliable enough to meet consumers' and industry's always-on requirements; this will not change, although availability of renewable power will increase, helping to lower generation and delivery costs.5G and other next-generation wireless technologies (especially low power wide area networks, LP-WANs) will be built with high PUE standards in mind, but it will be at least two decades before these fully supplant older, inefficient networks. And, in any case, overall power usage for 5G and fibre will still be several orders of magnitude higher than all older infrastructures combined, especially as smart infrastructures will increasingly require decentralised remote computing (edge computing) to function most effectively. This will put a tremendous strain on local power grids and may even see technology power requirements squeeze out other industries' (most likely, utilities and social services) needs.The main issue is that consumers' (both private and corporate) awareness of the environmental impact of their indispensable always-on communications, information and entertainment services is practically zero and unlikely to change unless this can be easily and forcefully demonstrated. It will be very difficult to quantify the impact of different types of services, however, as the global Internet infrastructure is so widely spread and the routes by which communications traffic is delivered is now so diffuse, that coming up with a reliable impact assessment is difficult to the point of uselessness.By and large, the tech sector's needs for power will likely continue to grow faster than mitigation efforts can be realised, so we expect that tech companies will need to turn to power purchase agreements and green bonds to at least show a willingness to deal. This will be the main focus of tech companies' activities ion 2020. Behind the scenes, there will be greater efforts - particularly by data centre operators - to improve PUE ratios to 1:1 status or better. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis>  Cost-Efficiency-Focused Corporates A Key Driver Of Sub-Saharan African TMT Sustainability, November 26 2019 Sustainability - Drivers And Implications For The Technology Sector, May 15 2019 Balance Of Power In Energy Sourcing Shifts To Datacentre Players, May 13 2019 Renewable Energy To Have A Modest Impact On Vodafone Egypt's Sustainability Goals, March 21 2019 Ireland's Datacentre Boom To Strain Power Grids, February 5 2019  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1508991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-N0N1-JD33-J541-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

The monopolist can also be expected to roll out at a relatively fast pace (assuming there are sufficient contractual incentives in place) and to deliver coverage at a lower total cost than in the Enhanced Competition scenario (as there is no network duplication).However, this model is likely to involve a lengthy implementation period (as it is incompatible with the existing legal framework) and might also face several other implementation challenges. Moreover, this model would result in a significant reduction in competition (compared to the baseline and the Enhanced Competition model), with a potentially negative effect on future investment and innovation.In its evaluation, Frontier concluded that nationalisation would cost about \u00a320bn, which is perhaps where Labour have got their (disputed) cost from. That's \u00a312m cheaper than enhancing competition, and more or less the same as maintaining the current situation.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>You can read the full report here (the summary is on page 11).</p></bodyText></listItem></list>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/15/bt-claims-labours-openreach-nationalisation-plan-could-cost/\">12:45PM</url>Reuters: Shell appoints Citi for $1bn Egyptian asset saleRoyal DutchShell has appointed Citi to run the sale of its onshore Egyptian oil and gas asset, which are expected to fetch around $1bn, Reuters reported.

The roll out of full fibre broadband across the country is underway, and all renationalisation will achieve is to slow down a process that needs speeding up.It is private sector investment that has driven connectivity, massively widened internet access and put faster speeds within reach for most UK households.

The UK has bilateral investment treaties with countries in which overseas BT shareholders are located, and these are intended to protect against asset expropriation. UK-based shareholders might expect to receive equal treatment.They add: BT has previously highlighted pension cost as a material obstacle to Openreach de-merger. In a nationalisation scenario, we believe that the BTPS Trustee would logically demand very substantial upfront compensation, regardless of whether Labour plans to legally extend the Crown Guarantee to cover legacy Openreach pensioners.CMC Markets' Michael Hewson noted:BT expressed surprise at last night's announcement having been assured by Labour fairly recently that they weren't being considered as a nationalisation candidate. With other companies also being told the same thing by the Labour Party, investors will no doubt be looking very carefully at other possible candidates for nationalisation, and whether they need to be concerned.AJ Bell's Russ Mould added:The relatively muted share price response likely reflects investors' scepticism about the plan getting off the ground. Current polling suggests Labour is unlikely to win a majority in the looming election, however if the party was to enjoy a late surge in the polls, BT shareholders might start to get a little bit more nervous.There is also a risk that Labour's idea proves popular with voters and other parties feel compelled to move at least some way in this direction.This would be another headache the company doesn't need as it also contends with questions over its dividend policy as well as the pressures of its existing investment in fibre broadband and 5G mobile.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/15/bt-claims-labours-openreach-nationalisation-plan-could-cost/\">9:51AM</url>British visual effects firm delays listing due to market uncertaintySpecial effects firm DNEG has postponed plans for a float in London, citing ongoing uncertainty in the market.Reuters reports:DNEG had received a strong level of interest from investors and would be assessing when to revive its IPO plans once market conditions improve, it said in a statement.Ten European IPOs set to raise $2.3bn were cancelled in the year to mid-October, with investor sentiment battered by expectations of an economic slowdown due to Brexit and the US-China trade war.In London a number of listings have been pulled this year, including Kazakh finance firm Kaspi.kz in October and Swiss Re's British life insurer ReAssure in July.DNEG, which has worked on films such as Inception, Interstellar, Ex Machina and Blade Runner 2049, had been aiming to raise \u00a3110m at IPO.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/15/bt-claims-labours-openreach-nationalisation-plan-could-cost/\">9:39AM</url>OpenReach currently makes up about a quarter of BT's revenuesAccording to BT's first half results (for the six months to the end of September), \u00a32.5bn of its \u00a311.4bn revenue came from OpenReach.Here's how revenues from its major business units look:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/15/bt-claims-labours-openreach-nationalisation-plan-could-cost/\">9:23AM</url>McDonnell says other broadband providers could also face nationalisationIt's not just BT that has reason for potential nerves this morning: Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said other providers may also be pulled in.Our politics team reports:In an interview this morning, John McDonnell suggested the party would try to \"come to an agreement\" with other commercial providers including Virgin, Sky and TalkTalk, but could nationalise them too.\"We'll come to an agreement with them, either an agreement of access arrangements or working alongside us, or, yes, if necessary they can then come within the ambit of British Broadband itself,\" he said.Pushed on whether this means Labour would take these companies over, Mr McDonnell said: \"I think we can come to an agreement - they're only 10%pc of the network and that's why we're doing this, because they've failed.You can follow the latest political reaction with reporter Tony Diver here:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>General election 2019: BT chief says Labour's plan to nationalise broadband could spiral to five times party's estimate - latest news</p></bodyText></listItem></list>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/15/bt-claims-labours-openreach-nationalisation-plan-could-cost/\">9:15AM</url>BT shares continue to recoverThe telecoms giant is now less than 0.5pc down.

Messaging app Telegram has joined Spotify in filing a formal complaint against the iOS App Store in Europe - adding its voice to a growing number of developers willing to publicly rail against what they decry as Apple's app \"tax.\"</p><p><br/>A spokesperson for Telegram confirmed the complaint to TechCrunch, pointing us to this public Telegram post where founder Pavel Durov sets out seven reasons why he thinks iPhone users should be concerned about the company's behavior.<br/>These range from the contention that Apple's 30% fee on app developers leads to higher prices for iPhone users; to censorship concerns, given Apple controls what's allowed (and not allowed) on its store; to criticism of delays to app updates that flow from Apple's app review process; to the claim that the App Store structure is inherently hostile to user privacy, given that Apple gets full visibility of which apps users are downloading and engaging with.<br/>This week Durov also published a blog post in which he takes aim at a number of \"myths\" he says Apple uses to try to justify the 30% app fee - such as a claim that iOS faces plenty of competition for developers; or that developers can choose not to develop for iOS and instead only publish apps for Android.<br/>\"Try to imagine Telegram or TikTok as Android -only apps and you will quickly understand why avoiding Apple is impossible,\" he writes. \"You can't just exclude iPhone users. As for the iPhone users, the costs for consumers to switch from an iPhone to an Android is so high that it qualifies as a monopolistic lock-in,\" - citing a study done by Yale University to bolster that claim.<br/>\"Now that anti-monopoly investigations against Apple have started in the EU and the US, I expect Apple to double down on spreading such myths,\" Durov adds. \"We shouldn't sit idly and let Apple's lobbyists and PR agents do their thing. At the end of the day, it is up to us - consumers and creators - to defend our rights and to stop monopolists from stealing our money. They may think they have tricked us into a deadlock, because we've already bought a critical mass of their devices and created a critical mass of apps for them. But we shouldn't be giving them a free ride any longer.\"<br/>The European Commission declined to comment on Telegram's complaint. Update: A spokeswoman has now told us: \"We confirm that we received a submission by Telegram against Apple. We will assess it under our standard procedures.\"<br/>We also reached out to Apple for comment, but the company also declined to provide an on the record statement regarding Telegram's complaint. A spokesperson did point to a piece of analyst research, from earlier this year, that found iOS had a market share of 15% versus Android's 85%. They also flagged a separate analyst report, which looks at commission rates charged by app and digital content stores and marketplaces - suggesting this shows that rates charged for similar types of stores are generally also around 30%.<br/>So the company's overarching argument against \"app tax\" complaints continues to be the claim that: A) Apple can't have monopoly power, given its relatively small mobile OS market share (versus Android); and B) the App Store fee is fair because it's basically the same as everyone else charges. (On the latter point it's true Google also takes a 30% cut via the Play Store. However the Android platform lets users sideload apps; whereas, on iOS, users would have to jailbreak their device to get the same level of freedom to freely install apps of their choice).<br/>Apple's arguments are also now being actively looked into by EU regulators. Last month the Competition Commission announced it's investigating Apple's iOS store (and Apple Pay) - saying a preliminary probe of the store had identified concerns related to conditions and restrictions applied by the tech giant.<br/>Specifically vis-\u00e0-vis the App Store, the Commission said it's looking at Apple's mandatory requirement that developers use its proprietary in-app purchase system, and at restrictions it applies on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of the App Store.<br/>The investigation by EU regulators is just the latest in a series of major big tech antitrust probes under the bloc's current competition chief, Margrethe Vestager - who has also been digging into Amazon and Facebook business practices in recent years, as well as hitting Google with a series of record-breaking antitrust fines.<br/>Over in the U.S., meanwhile, lawmakers are also actively grappling with competition concerns that have long been attached to a number of tech giants - and are being exacerbated by the pandemic concentrating platform power. Apple is one of the tech giants of concern, though not, seemingly, top of U.S. lawmakers' target list.<br/>Yesterday, a hearing of the House Antitrust Subcommittee took testimony from four big tech CEOs: Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai - with Pichai, Bezos and Zuckerberg getting the most questions from lawmakers.<br/>Cook did face a number of questions around how the company operates the App Store, though - including about the commission it charges developers and a specific line of enquiry on why it had removed rival screen time apps. Asked whether Apple could ever raise its 30% take on app subscriptions Cook sought to sidestep the question, saying the fee had remained unchanged since the launch of the store.<br/>He then followed up by arguing Apple faces huge competition for developers - citing alternatives platforms such as Windows and Xbox as also fiercely vying for developers, and likening the competition to attract developers as akin to \"a street fight for market share.\"<br/>The contention from complainants like Spotify and Telegram is that Cook's claim of Apple facing fierce competition for developers' wares, from its position as the world's second largest smartphone OS by market share, does not stand up to scrutiny. But it'll be up to EU regulators to determine how to define the market for smartphone apps and, flowing from that, whether they identify harm or not.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1303730</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HT-2DW1-DYDW-7470-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1031\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

A number of smaller players are lobbing grenades over the fence in the hope of forcing regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to intervene[2]. Today, secure messaging app Telegram[3] is joining in, filing a formal antitrust complaint to the European Union's competition authority.As the Financial Times[4] points out, it's the third big name, after Spotify and Rakuten[5], which has lobbied the EU to do something about the App Store's lock-in and 30 percent commission. And here, as then, the general sentiment is that the commission is too high, and that not allowing users to download apps from other sources is harming competition. </p><p>A few days ago, Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov published an open letter[6] concerning Apple's '30 percent tax on apps.' That includes a claim that running the app store does not cost what Apple generates in revenue, and that app store fees did not exist in the PC era. Durov added that companies also cannot simply build apps for Android instead, thanks to the sheer size of iOS' install base.It's not clear if these arguments, which broadly amount to saying that Apple has too much money, and is too popular, will carry weight with the EU. After all, if Margrethe Vestager is going to build a case, she needs to prove that what Apple is doing is stifling competition and harming users.But even if Telegram's argument is weak, it's clear that every developer with an axe to grind against Apple is going to use this as an opportunity.

A number of smaller players are lobbing grenades over the fence in the hope of forcing regulators on both sides of the\u00a0Atlantic to intervene. Today, secure messaging app\u00a0Telegram\u00a0is joining in, filing a formal antitrust complaint to the European Union's competition authority.</p><p><br/>As the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0points out, it's the third big name, after\u00a0Spotify and Rakuten, that\u00a0has lobbied the EU to do something about the App Store's lock-in and 30 percent commission. And here, as then, the general sentiment is that the commission is too high, and that not allowing users to download apps from other sources is harming competition.\u00a0<br/>A few days ago, Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov published an\u00a0open letter\u00a0concerning Apple's \"30 percent tax on apps.\" That includes a claim that running the app store does not cost what Apple generates in revenue, and that app-store fees did not exist in the PC era. Durov added that companies also cannot simply build apps for Android instead, thanks to the sheer size of iOS' install base.<br/>It's not clear if these arguments, which broadly amount to saying that Apple has too much money, and is too popular, will carry weight with the EU. After all, if Margrethe Vestager is going to build a case, she needs to prove that what Apple is doing is stifling competition and harming users.\u00a0But even if Telegram's argument is weak, it's clear that every developer with an axe to grind against Apple is going to use this as an opportunity.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1342817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KG-T8W1-JBYT-H0FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"271\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

TheFinancial Times[4] reports that Telegram submitted the complaint to the European Union's competition regulator   Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov outlined his arguments in a blog post[5] a few days earlier. He suggested that Apple's defence of its 30% commission is based on seven myths - beginning with Steve Job's original claim that the 30% commission was to cover the costs of operating the store. Myth 1. 30% commission allows Apple to maintain the App Store.In fact, running an app store costs only a fraction of what Apple takes from app developers. </p><p>Every quarter, Apple receives billions of dollars from third-party apps. Meanwhile, the expenses required to host and review these apps are in the tens of millions, not billions of dollars. We know that because we at Telegram host and review more public content than the App Store ever will. Actually, any company running a massive video platform will need both more servers and more moderators than a company running an app store. Some of his arguments are weak - like the idea that Apple just doesn't need the money as it has billions sitting in offshore accounts and doesn't know what to do with it. But he's of course absolutely right when he says Apple is being disingenuous when it claims developers don't need to create iOS apps. Myth 5. Any developer who doesn't like the 30% commission on iPhones can just build apps for Android.Developers don't really have a choice between iOS and Android: if they want to create a service that is socially relevant, they will have to build apps for both platforms in the mobile duopoly. Try to imagine Telegram or TikTok as Android-only apps and you will quickly understand why avoiding Apple is impossible. You can't just exclude iPhone users. As for the iPhone users, the costs for consumers to switch from an iPhone to an Android is so high that it qualifies as a monopolistic lock-in (more about this in The Antitrust Case Against Apple[6], a study done by Yale University). That Yale study essentially argues that once you've owned an iPhone for quite a few years, and have bought a lot of apps for it, it would be very expensive to have to re-buy Android versions, and thus Apple has locked you into its platform. Which is true if you have a lot of paid apps, but of course equally true in reverse. He also says that Apple's claim that it charges the same 30% commission as Google is true but irrelevant. Myth 6. App Store's 30% commission is in line with what other platforms are charging.Apple just published a study that says that other platforms such as Android's Google Play also have a 30% commission. This comparison is irrelevant, because Android allows its users to install apps from sources other than Google Play. One can even run competing app stores on Android. As for the other platforms mentioned in the market overview, they have nothing to do with mobile operating systems and are nowhere near iOS and Android in terms of the number of users / number of third-party apps / switching costs for consumers. Durov certainly doesn't pull any punches in the conclusions of his antitrust complaint against Apple. Now that anti-monopoly investigations against Apple have started in the EU and the US, I expect Apple to double down on spreading such myths as described above. We shouldn't sit idly and let Apple's lobbyists and PR agents do their thing. At the end of the day, it is up to us - consumers and creators - to defend our rights and to stop monopolists from stealing our money. They may think they have tricked us into a deadlock, because we've already bought a critical mass of their devices and created a critical mass of apps for them. But we shouldn't be giving them a free ride any longer. Via Engadget[7]. Photo: Press Association[8]. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

To succeed, it must comply with regulators by the end of October, which sounds unlikely but only time will tell. The company doesn't have the best relationship with governments, but it stands to lose a hefty investment, so it's trying its best to deliver on its promise. </p><p>While many are probably familiar with Facebook's efforts to take the global payments market by storm with its Libra cryptocurrency, you may have not heard about a similar project that comes from another social network, Telegram. There have been several rumors of an \"initial coin offering\" (ICO), but the company had reportedly scrapped[1] the plans after seeing the increasingly tight regulations proposed the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, it turns out that the much-hyped project might see the light of day. According to a report[2] by The New York Times, Telegram is planning to launch a digital currency called Gram within the next two months. The company has told investors that it's going to roll out the Gram wallets to two thirds of its estimated 300 million global users.Just like Libra, Gram is yet another digital currency that promises to make payments easy, fast, and secure. However, due to the way Telegram works, the very same encryption that makes its messaging app secure is also what brought it under the lens of regulators. The company's digital currency will probably emulate Bitcoin in many ways, which would make it an attractive option for people interested in avoiding laws and regulations. This wouldn't bode well with authorities, who are increasingly interested[3] in such developments and their many implications.Telegram is apparently pushing its token out to hold onto an estimated $1.7 million raised from over 200 investors. The idea here is that the company has a deadline -- if it doesn't manage to launch Gram by October 31 it risks losing all that money.In the grand scheme of things, several companies are trying to push their own digital currencies. Binance is a notable example with its Venus[4] cryptocurrency, but that is in the early stages of development. Still, Telegram's token isn't backed by real currency and its value would instead fluctuate as a result of how many people are willing to invest in it. The company says a test version of the Gram network will go live within the next few weeks, and third party wallet providers like Button Wallet are jumping in[5] to help with adoption by offering Gram tokens to those who activate its wallet. The social platform has bigger plans for the Telegram Open Network -- it wants to slowly evolve it into a decentralized infrastructure for all kinds of digital applications, similar to Ethereum.

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Group's research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.</p><p><br/><br/>'Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces,' says Bjorn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.<br/><br/>'At the same time,' Sandberg adds, 'other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.'<br/><br/>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:<br/><br/>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real<br/><br/>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and 'flight shaming' have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture... in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.<br/><br/>The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful 'green' cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership.<br/><br/>A growing 'internet' of connected health, medical and communications devices - attached to our bodies<br/><br/>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, aren't relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less 'attached at the hip', well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the 'Internet of Bodies' become a much bigger thing.<br/><br/>Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, 'We are Not Waiting', have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body. Biohacks such as Elon Musk's Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the 'IoB' will have great potential.<br/><br/>5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms<br/><br/>2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5G's speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.<br/><br/>These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.<br/><br/>2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real.<br/><br/>Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks<br/><br/>Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, they're creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that use mesh or peer-to-peer technology are expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during the Hong Kong protests.<br/><br/>Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity.<br/><br/>The term 'dirty data' will be used to question AI credibility<br/><br/>When faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.<br/><br/>We call this 'dirty data', a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as 'fake news'. As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.<br/><br/>The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to ensure data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed.<br/><br/>A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services aren't really free.<br/><br/>The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. It's easier to do, it's built into daily behaviours and so far, it's much less regulated than the health sector.<br/><br/>A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independent from how much they know about us personally.<br/><br/>7-20<br/><br/>7 - eSIM takes off<br/><br/>8 - Charge rage<br/><br/>9 - Sleep tech<br/><br/>10 - Clash of the streaming giants<br/><br/>11 - Gaming gold rush<br/><br/>12 - DIY AI<br/><br/>13 - Deepfake for the masses<br/><br/>14 - Bringing Big Tech down to size<br/><br/>15 - Ethical AI gets in gear<br/><br/>16 - Digital Twinning is digital winning<br/><br/>17 - Fight phone scams with Machine Learning<br/><br/>18 - The gig's up: Labour rights for Gig Economy workers<br/><br/>19 - 'Second-hand' is the new 'smart'<br/><br/>20 - 2020 takes us to the stars<br/><br/>To read up on the rest of the 20 trends, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telenor.com/techtrends2020\">www.telenor.com/techtrends2020</url><br/><br/>Press contact:<br/><br/>Tormod Sandsto<br/><br/>Director, Media Relations, Telenor Group<br/><br/>M: +47 90943215 | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tormod.sandsto@telenor.com\">tormod.sandsto@telenor.com</email><br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM8-WTG1-JD3Y-Y0GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Group's research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.</p><p><br/><br/>\"Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces,\" says Bjoern Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.<br/><br/>\"At the same time,\" Sandberg adds, \"other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.\"<br/><br/>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:<br/><br/>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real<br/><br/>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and \"flight shaming\" have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.<br/><br/>The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership.<br/><br/>A growing \"internet\" of connected health, medical and communications devices - attached to our bodies<br/><br/>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, aren't relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less \"attached at the hip\", well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the \"Internet of Bodies\" become a much bigger thing.<br/><br/>Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, \"We are Not Waiting\", have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body. Biohacks such as Elon Musk's Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the \"IoB\" will have great potential.<br/><br/>5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms<br/><br/>2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5G's speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.<br/><br/>These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.<br/><br/>2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real.<br/><br/>Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks<br/><br/>Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, they're creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that use mesh or peer-to-peer technology are expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during the Hong Kong protests.<br/><br/>Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity.<br/><br/>The term \"dirty data\" will be used to question AI credibility<br/><br/>When faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.<br/><br/>We call this \"dirty data\", a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as \"fake news\". As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.<br/><br/>The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to ensure data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed.<br/><br/>A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services aren't really free.<br/><br/>The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. It's easier to do, it's built into daily behaviours and so far, it's much less regulated than the health sector.<br/><br/>A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independent from how much they know about us personally.<br/><br/>7-20<br/><br/>* 7 - eSIM takes off<br/><br/>* 8 - Charge rage<br/><br/>* 9 - Sleep tech<br/><br/>* 10 - Clash of the streaming giants<br/><br/>* 11 - Gaming gold rush<br/><br/>* 12 - DIY AI<br/><br/>* 13 - Deepfake for the masses<br/><br/>* 14 - Bringing Big Tech down to size<br/><br/>* 15 - Ethical AI gets in gear<br/><br/>* 16 - Digital Twinning is digital winning<br/><br/>* 17 - Fight phone scams with Machine Learning<br/><br/>* 18 - The gig's up: Labour rights for Gig Economy workers<br/><br/>* 19 - \"Second-hand\" is the new \"smart\"<br/><br/>* 20 - 2020 takes us to the stars<br/><br/>Source: Telenor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONTEL-0050600037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM2-P151-JB5M-W4BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459497</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Telecom News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Group's research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces,\" says Bjorn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.</p><p>\"At the same time,\" Sandberg adds, \"other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.\"</p><p>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:</p><p>1: Green gets mean</p><p>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real</p><p>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and \"flight shaming\" have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture... in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.</p><p>The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.</p><p>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership.</p><p>2: The Internet of Bodies</p><p>A growing \"internet\" of connected health, medical and communications devices - attached to our bodies</p><p>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, aren't relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less \"attached at the hip\", well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the \"Internet of Bodies\" become a much bigger thing.</p><p>Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, \"We are Not Waiting\", have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body. Biohacks such as Elon Musk's Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the \"IoB\" will have great potential.</p><p>3: Tech-arranged \"marriages\"</p><p>5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms</p><p>2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5G's speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.</p><p>These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.</p><p>2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real.</p><p>4: Build your own network</p><p>Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks</p><p>Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, they're creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that use mesh or peer-to-peer technology are expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during the Hong Kong protests.</p><p>Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity.</p><p>5: \"DIRTY DATA!\" is the new \"FAKE NEWS!\"</p><p>The term \"dirty data\" will be used to question AI credibility</p><p>When faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.</p><p>We call this \"dirty data\", a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as \"fake news\". As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.</p><p>The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to ensure data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed.</p><p>6: What is the cost of trust?</p><p>A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services aren't really free.</p><p>The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. It's easier to do, it's built into daily behaviours and so far, it's much less regulated than the health sector.</p><p>A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independent from how much they know about us personally.</p><p>7 - eSIM takes off</p><p>8 - Charge rage</p><p>9 - Sleep tech</p><p>10 - Clash of the streaming giants</p><p>11 - Gaming gold rush</p><p>12 - DIY AI</p><p>13 - Deepfake for the masses</p><p>14 - Bringing Big Tech down to size</p><p>15 - Ethical AI gets in gear</p><p>16 - Digital Twinning is digital winning</p><p>17 - Fight phone scams with Machine Learning</p><p>18 - The gig's up: Labour rights for Gig Economy workers</p><p>19 - \"Second-hand\" is the new \"smart\"</p><p>20 - 2020 takes us to the stars</p><p>To read up on the rest of the 20 trends, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telenor.com/techtrends\">www.telenor.com/techtrends</url></p><p>Press contact:</p><p>Tormod Sandsto</p><p>Director, Media Relations, Telenor Group</p><p>M: +47 90943215 | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tormod.sandsto@telenor.com\">tormod.sandsto@telenor.com</email></p><p>Download illustrations of the 20 trends here.</p><p>High res image of Bjorn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research, is here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HUGIN-358089936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HUGIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM6-V6W1-JC8H-G4PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">263816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1769\"/><timeReceived>1:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 GLOBE NEWSWIRE.

People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.\"</p><p>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1:\u00a0Green gets mean</emphasis></p><p>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real</p><p>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and \"flight shaming\" have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture... in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.</p><p>The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.</p><p>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2:\u00a0The Internet of Bodies</emphasis></p><p>A growing \"internet\" of connected health, medical and communications devices - attached to our bodies\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, aren't relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less \"attached at the hip\", well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the \"Internet of Bodies\" become a much bigger thing.</p><p>Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, \"We are Not Waiting\", have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body.\u00a0Biohacks such as Elon Musk's Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the \"IoB\" will have great potential.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3:\u00a0Tech-arranged \"marriages\"</emphasis></p><p>5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms</p><p>2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5G's speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.</p><p>These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.</p><p>2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4:\u00a0Build your own network</emphasis></p><p>Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks</p><p>Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, they're creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that use<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=al65vlK5xcEXPNsXz_paq6I5KAwcCvGBXX9qwN2OLVFLPKBPBoBojAo2mf4KeTogu4YOgrP0FFkP1IL02IukzxJSSPvHknta6v_jKe6u3HaDOgrzfEWLeVsTEOzg3PTo25C8au51WPTYybIKlf8PXt-Xe-ly6tS8e1cM2G5pO4tQlBwH5KepwNiQ5DPucGyd\">mesh or peer-to-peer technology</url>are expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during the      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3nJJCNEASDrnrATpdc5Lql5caq84kFtdZvklkWA_x5Zh-9NtX45QD4aBhDqOTh17M5Ut0uWJdwDEjUXelkJwUBrCCFZxEM-9CYOFFWynA98YI1dRl_Be4GQisfuwFsoJj-RjObkhsFDvLD8gQaIsM2ZL2WdBTzmsMSXa933_r-YYmR2YW1bi77-zbB9b-HQ0f4FpBSQZG1fDMfPpED4sZxBWxXJ8FB651ufZVJecGD0=\">Hong Kong protests</url>.</p><p>Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5:\u00a0\"DIRTY DATA!\" is the new \"FAKE NEWS!\"</emphasis></p><p>The term \"dirty data\" will be used to question AI credibility</p><p>When faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.</p><p>We call this \"dirty data\", a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as \"fake news\". As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.</p><p>The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to\u00a0 ensure\u00a0 data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6: What is the cost of trust?</emphasis></p><p>A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services aren't really free.</p><p>The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. It's easier to do, it's built into daily behaviours and so far, it's much less regulated than the health sector.</p><p>A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independent from how much they know about us personally.</p><p>7\u00a0 - eSIM takes off8\u00a0 - Charge rage9\u00a0 - Sleep tech10 - Clash of the streaming giants11 - Gaming gold rush12 - DIY AI13 - Deepfake for the masses14 - Bringing Big Tech down to size15 - Ethical AI gets in gear16 - Digital Twinning is digital winning17 - Fight phone scams with Machine Learning18 - The gig's up: Labour rights for Gig Economy workers19 - \"Second-hand\" is the new \"smart\"20 - 2020 takes us to the stars</p><p>To read up on the rest of the 20 trends, visit<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VrSQqlBRSr7LnLqCKWWdazL-UwgU6dNW7PdwTK_1QmWzTz9MVUyLBMEzYPrCoEYc5nsYfILzs5XMr5ZvPhCFkZW8daERb1VrIc1Frg1kuWtWA__xdxnDYqIyPnethBNH\">www.telenor.com/techtrends</url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Press contact:</emphasis>Tormod Sandst\u00f8Director, Media Relations, Telenor GroupM: +47 90943215 |<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RIRYdqxJDMrj3b--KWnKhtCmh9LAb5hhz41EXvIM-jnkAXz2Th8A4ABuZW0akGwVMRlFn5GoK9VYF5G9epMYpoaZmYEOnTQTYDAqD7InEoeqMbl3lOFlsn_7TCbaTjTw\">tormod.sandsto@telenor.com</url></p><p>Download illustrations of the 20 trends<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=m7rky23CJwiKzNO7ONzAxlFhQMdkL4sxNGVjStAJUpVJi_pjcp0tbw9o-6Luh6v1IeQG6FktenYZ6-AbFqD8dqDwfQM8ZOJ4-ej4cpeDO1ZDBFaAs2lar7ajpCI_VEmI\">here</url>.High res image of Bj\u00f8rn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research, is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=m7rky23CJwiKzNO7ONzAxnDxpY2CbcAv9P4bblU0n-eipbYzHR7JgWNYjCdBBv2WJeTegMPZA0hOLiYuprPUcz8Q4nCrXoVK2OYNDEFKhKD2vJ3QdbKqL0YZBLxlJXCt1OWNh23TgWSwpwHtQbUvdfwATIeEX7-_ZVo8bccPxYY=\">here</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000296031en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM1-1N41-JDPT-Y30J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1773\"/><timeReceived>07:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business?

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Group's research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.<br/><br/>\"Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces,\" says Bj\u00f8rn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.<br/><br/>\"At the same time,\" Sandberg adds, \"other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.\"<br/><br/>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:<br/><br/>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real<br/><br/>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and \"flight shaming\" have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture... in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore.

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Groups research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces, says Bjrn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.</p><p>At the same time, Sandberg adds, other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isnt a place that can be defined by a single storyline, its our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in  in both of our worlds  and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.</p><p>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:</p><p>1:Green gets mean</p><p>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real</p><p>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and flight shaming have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.</p><p>The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.</p><p>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, well see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership.</p><p>2:The Internet of Bodies</p><p>A growing internet of connected health, medical and communications devices  attached to our bodies</p><p>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, arent relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less attached at the hip, well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the Internet of Bodies become a much bigger thing.</p><p>Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, We are Not Waiting, have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body.Biohacks such as Elon Musks Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the IoB will have great potential.</p><p>3:Tech-arranged marriages</p><p>5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms</p><p>2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5Gs speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.</p><p>These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.</p><p>2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real.</p><p>4:Build your own network</p><p>Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks</p><p>Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, theyre creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that use mesh or peer-to-peer technology are expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during the Hong Kong protests.</p><p>Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity.</p><p>5:DIRTY DATA! is the new FAKE NEWS!</p><p>The term dirty data will be used to question AI credibility</p><p>When faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.</p><p>We call this dirty data, a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as fake news. As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.</p><p>The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to ensure data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed.</p><p>6: What is the cost of trust?</p><p>A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services arent really free.</p><p>The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. Its easier to do, its built into daily behaviours and so far, its much less regulated than the health sector.</p><p>A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independ 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-160787191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM7-GKT1-F11P-X54Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5V</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CA1X</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DPKL</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Group's research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces,\" says Bjorn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.</p><p>\"At the same time,\" Sandberg adds, \"other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.\"</p><p>Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020:</p><p>Green innovations go beyond hype and get real</p><p>Reusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and \"flight shaming\" have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture... in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.</p><p>The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.</p><p>Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership.</p><p>A growing \"internet\" of connected health, medical and communications devices - attached to our bodies</p><p>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, aren't relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less \"attached at the hip\", well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the \"Internet of Bodies\" become a much bigger thing.</p><p>Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, \"We are Not Waiting\", have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body. Biohacks such as Elon Musk's Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the \"IoB\" will have great potential.</p><p>5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms</p><p>2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5G's speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.</p><p>These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.</p><p>2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real.</p><p>Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks</p><p>Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, they're creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that use mesh or peer-to-peer technology are expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during the Hong Kong protests.</p><p>Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity.</p><p>The term \"dirty data\" will be used to question AI credibility</p><p>When faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.</p><p>We call this \"dirty data\", a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as \"fake news\". As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.</p><p>The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to ensure data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed.</p><p>A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services aren't really free.</p><p>The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. It's easier to do, it's built into daily behaviours and so far, it's much less regulated than the health sector.</p><p>A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independent from how much they know about us personally.</p><p>7-20</p><p>* 7 - eSIM takes off</p><p>* 8 - Charge rage</p><p>* 9 - Sleep tech</p><p>* 10 - Clash of the streaming giants</p><p>* 11 - Gaming gold rush</p><p>* 12 - DIY AI</p><p>* 13 - Deepfake for the masses</p><p>* 14 - Bringing Big Tech down to size</p><p>* 15 - Ethical AI gets in gear</p><p>* 16 - Digital Twinning is digital winning</p><p>* 17 - Fight phone scams with Machine Learning</p><p>* 18 - The gig's up: Labour rights for Gig Economy workers</p><p>* 19 - \"Second-hand\" is the new \"smart\"</p><p>* 20 - 2020 takes us to the stars</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6943582 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6943582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM8-9VY1-DYG2-R1WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1709\"/><timeReceived>8:51 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At the start of this new decade, Telenor Group's research arm believes that people will reflect more on how our real world and this new digital reality should safely and productively intersect.'Many of the trends we spotlight for next year show innovation charging ahead faster than ever, enabled by more access and more demand, as well as by revolutionary new tech platforms and sociopolitical forces,' says Bj\u00f8rn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research.'At the same time,' Sandberg adds, 'other trends suggest we are having a common technological epiphany, a kind of digital realisation. People are waking up and examining how and where technologies, including AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and new network innovations will best and most securely connect them with the people and things that matter most. The world of technology isn't a place that can be defined by a single storyline, it's our job to understand the larger sometimes contradicting contexts we live in - in both of our worlds - and then to home in on the most important developments that could reshape our lives.'Here are the 20 trends that point to an exciting, chaotic and complex 2020: 1:\u00a0Green gets mean Green innovations go beyond hype and get realReusable shopping bags, plastic straw bans and 'flight shaming' have been the causes du jour among the Instagram Influencer set, but big picture\u2026 in 2020, no one will be satisfied with empty words, greenwashing or drop-in-the-bucket efforts anymore. </p><p>In 2020, we will see green innovations go beyond the hype, using combinations of IoT, big data and AI tech to measure consumption, reduce demand and significantly reduce carbon footprints while cutting costs and building new revenue streams. This action comes as a result of consumers, investors, purchasers in the business world and employees demanding that we get our act together.The telco industry will be a crucial foundation of the future economy and can drive real change across multiple sectors in society, in collaboration with its suppliers, investors and customers. Telcos can encourage their equipment vendors, IoT hardware and mobile phone manufacturers to commit to higher climate ambitions, by using recycled raw materials, responsible minerals provisioning, renewable power, new modes of transportation and sustainable packaging.Moving into 2030; businesses, particularly in Europe, will move toward sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity, laying the foundation of climate neutral business operations. And for consumers, mobile services will continue to provide the capacity for individuals to access apps and services that will drive more widespread and effective green habits wherever they are. Finally, in the tech space, we'll see increasingly generous public and private financing for green startups and scale-ups. What will drive successful \"green\" cases in business? A combination of sustainable business models, availability of data, digital competence and strong leadership. 2:\u00a0The Internet of Bodies A growing 'internet' of connected health, medical and communications devices - attached to our bodies<br/>The term, Internet of things (IoT) has been given copious column inches in recent years, particularly in the business, tech and trade press. But sensors on shipping containers, manufacturing systems and agriculture infrastructure, while broadly impactful, aren't relatable to the everyday tech user. But 2020 promises to bring all of this much, much closer to home. If you thought that people and mobile technology were already more or less 'attached at the hip', well, be prepared to be taken literally. This next year will see the 'Internet of Bodies' become a much bigger thing.Today and even more so starting next year, we are connecting our bodies through a host of monitors that measure blood pressure, blood oxygen, activity, heart rate, arrhythmia and even snoring. And in 2020 we will see the first applications that go beyond just monitoring and into actual auto-interventions. One such example is insulin pumps. A large community of patients and health advocates, 'We are Not Waiting', have pushed the frontier for a long time, and in 2020, we will see the first commercial systems closing the loop between reading blood sugar and delivering insulin to the body.\u00a0Biohacks such as Elon Musk's Neuralink startup are still far from commercialization, but there are diseases and conditions that are costly and care intensive where the 'IoB' will have great potential. 3:\u00a0Tech-arranged 'marriages' 5G, IoT and AI will spur industry collaborations that share competence and co-create world-changing platforms2019 was year 0 for commercial 5G launches. In 2020 we will see widespread launches in most developed economies. Mobile providers will put 5G's speed and capacity on centre stage, but the real innovations, and with them, sweeping societal changes, will come from behind the scenes where industries are getting together and mixing things up.These innovations include network-slicing, with which business-critical systems can run unencumbered over the mobile internet. Or something called Network Function Virtualization (NFV), where network services can be developed by software, which will radically speed up how services are developed. With lower latency (meaning: no signal delays, everything in real-time) and a vastly higher number of IoT devices out in the world, emergency, eHealth, logistics, security systems and remote investigations will be enabled by quality networks that allow remote investigations using video, drones and sensors that securely transmit data.2020 will mark the beginning of this innovation journey. Turning these opportunities into scalable innovations will require industries and governments to pool their competences and start co-creating services. The technology is here, but no single company possesses the capabilities to make it real. 4:\u00a0Build your own network Peer-to-peer tech and mesh apps will enable off-the-grid, build-it-yourself communications networks Tech companies and governments are collecting and analysing more data about communication patterns and Internet usage. With this, they're creating new products, services and offerings, and in some parts of the world, surveillance systems. As a result, more users are taking steps to protect their communications. In addition to fully encrypted apps, apps that usemesh or peer-to-peer technologyare expected to increase in popularity as the technology for creating networks without centralised infrastructure improves. In other words, private citizens and organisations are developing the ability to run their own communication networks, such as most recently during theHong Kong protests .Communicating without a central coordinating network is appealing to people for many reasons, and in 2020, we expect to see more go that route especially in conflict situations, to mobilise for protests, and simply to stay below the radar. Mesh apps can also be valuable in situations where the regular networks are not available, such as in the wilderness, in cases of network outages, and in events or situations with a need to communicate with friends and family in the near vicinity. 5:\u00a0'DIRTY DATA!' is the new 'FAKE NEWS!' The term 'dirty data' will be used to question AI credibilityWhen faced with a choice, we always want to make the best one. And nowadays, with vast amounts of data and advanced analytics, machines can point us to the best option or even make the decisions for us. But what if the data sets and processes are inaccurate, biased or even compromised? Then the decisions may be flawed, or even illegal.We call this 'dirty data', a term that in 2020 may go as mainstream as 'fake news'. As data-driven decision-making from Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) become more common, it will be subject to more public scrutiny. People will ask whether solutions are fair and unbiased, or whether the data used to train them was 'dirty'.The EU and the data science community is very aware of this challenge, and is working hard to ensure data quality, start-ups focused on data auditing are seeing the light of day and significant research is going into finding solutions. The question is whether practitioners will manage to keep pace as new data is generated at astonishing speed. 6: What is the cost of trust? A growing minority of people are waking up to the fact that free searches and social media services aren't really free.The competition for your trust is going to intensify in 2020 and the arena will be your mobile phone. A long line of scandals has plagued many of the internet and social media companies that leverage our mobile connections, leading people to take a second look at these organisations. Trust is at the core of all relationships, including those with customers, but the reality is that most of us now share more personal info online than we share with our doctors. It's easier to do, it's built into daily behaviours and so far, it's much less regulated than the health sector.A majority of people in markets as diverse as Norway, Malaysia and Pakistan still believe that 'free' services come at no cost, but we see signs of a growing minority of people who understand that these companies make their money from our data by using it to sell tailored advertisements. In 2020, we believe customers will increasingly reserve trust to companies who have a line of revenue independent from how much they know about us personally.7 - eSIM takes off<br/>8 - Charge rage<br/>9 - Sleep tech<br/>10 - Clash of the streaming giants<br/>11 - Gaming gold rush<br/>12 - DIY AI<br/>13 - Deepfake for the masses<br/>14 - Bringing Big Tech down to size<br/>15 - Ethical AI gets in gear<br/>16 - Digital Twinning is digital winning<br/>17 - Fight phone scams with Machine Learning<br/>18 - The gig's up: Labour rights for Gig Economy workers<br/>19 - 'Second-hand' is the new 'smart'<br/>20 - 2020 takes us to the starsTo read up on the rest of the 20 trends, visitwww.telenor.com/techtrends Press contact:<br/>Tormod Sandst\u00f8<br/>Director, Media Relations, Telenor Group<br/>M: +47 90943215 | Download illustrations of the 20 trendshere .<br/>High res image of Bj\u00f8rn Taale Sandberg, Head of Telenor Research, ishere .<br/>MENAFN2811201900703653ID1099339013</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099339013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM2-15D1-JCNX-3070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp;

Who hopes.\u00a0And doesn't know how to be any other way, be it in his personal life or the way he works. And he works in our industry. Seeking to transform the way we make, move, distribute and manage money, a little bit every day.</p><p>It is hard.</p><p>It gets messy.</p><p>It is full of heart and no corners are cut.</p><p>Yes I mean life.

What the hell are we all doing in what is offhandedly\u00a0perceived as the domain of bloodthirsty cynics?</p><p>Well.</p><p>We do the work that needs doing.</p><p>We do the work that we believe needs us to do it.</p><p>But we don't tell the story anywhere near enough, and we should.</p><p>Because it is a good story.</p><p>There are villains and mishaps galore. There are false starts and trials but also there are mysteries to be debunked and misunderstood ogres to be redeemed. Ours is a good story that needs telling.</p><p>The wolf of Wall Street and Gordon Gecko have been the face of banking way too long. The bank teller and the depositary receipts clerk have better stories to tell. About the universality of our experiences and anxieties with money. About the interdependence of one's meagre savings book and financing a damn project in a country so far away as to seem made up.

The story has dragons.</p><p>Why don't we talk about them?</p><p>Why are we embarrassed, almost apologetic of the work we do and the passion we bring to it?</p><p>Money is not the stuff of dreams perhaps. But many a dream died before it lived because money ran out. Money wasn't there in the first place.\u00a0Education. Art supplies. Train tickets. Roads. Irrigation. Vaccines.</p><p>From living long enough to dream.</p><p>To turning dreams into plans.</p><p>To walking the path towards endeavour of whatever kind, it takes work and courage and grit.</p><p>And money.</p><p>Infrastructure.</p><p>Services.</p><p>Spending cash.</p><p>Food.</p><p>healthcare. Education. Plumbing.</p><p>That's the world we live in.</p><p>The universal, contentious, scary and complex world of money.</p><p>That's where we are. Battling the dragons of old. Trying to simplify it. Streamline it. Keep it honest.</p><p>That's what we do.</p><p>We try to make it fairer, easier, a little more accessible.</p><p>The days are not glamorous but the years add up to something that is bigger than the sum of its parts even if there are more reversal than triumphs, more false starts than magic wands.</p><p>Still.</p><p>We work. We strive. We occasionally succeed. Progress is made.</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>Painfully.</p><p>Relentlessly.</p><p>We should be telling the story.

It needs more of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I am the booty</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black, white sans serif script, print of skull wearing a pirate hat and gratuitous crossbones, bought in a bookstore in New Orleans because it spoke the truth.</emphasis></p><p>But seriously.</p><p>Money is unglamorous. And although none of us starve, this industry doesn't pay what people think it does. None of us will be rich doing this. That's not why we do it.</p><p>And sure, fintech is sexy. For now. And although some of us are \"fintech famous\", that is neither a thing that lasts nor a thing that scales and it doesn't mean much anyway other than: we really freaking care. Deeply and truly and intensely.</p><p>And that's the story I want to tell.</p><p>A story of community.</p><p>Of dragon-slayers who will remain unsung.</p><p>Because the work we do is seriously unglamorous. The most gifted minstrel would be stumped if asked to sing the praises of why changing treasury services matters to my grandmother.</p><p>But it does. Because money is connected in a large cycle of interdependence and helping the movement be seamless, transparent, cheap and dependable makes everything easier and fairer.</p><p>Just you watch.</p><p>And sure, nobody will ever make a movie about the CTO who swapped out their COBOL-based infrastructure for a lithe, event-based distributed architecture that allows them to service their communities faster and cheaper. You will never know who they are. But your pension will still get cheaper. Your mortgage more flexible. Your personal banking more intuitive. The bank's ability (if not appetite) to underwrite student loans or SME bridging finance will get smarter because their available data sources and behavioural finance inputs exploded. In a good way.</p><p>Isn't that a wonderful story?</p><p>Does it need any more dragons?</p><p>I think not.</p><p>Do you need more booty, higher treasure, than people sitting inside the world of money trying to make it fairer, more accessible, less opaque and predatory and uneven?</p><p>Loving the obscure and unglamorous cause they serve?</p><p>That is all.</p><p>And for that I don't have a t-shirt. Yet.</p><p>But I have a lifetime of commitment, a tribe of fighters and enough time ahead of us to keep on keeping on.</p><p>The work we do won't end.</p><p>This story is only just beginning.</p><p>And it should be told.</p><p>Because it affects us all.

My suggestion is for you to draft a letter the posse members can send. Sincerely, Wayne Whitman of Hurst\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Whitman, your suggestion could not have come at a better time. Friday was the deadline to introduce bills at the Texas Legislature. Now that we know what cards are on the table, the posse can figure out what hands to play.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The posse are readers of this column, plus people in the DallasNews Watchdog Posse group on Facebook, and those who receive a periodic \u201caction newsletter\u201d from me. (Write to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:watchdog@dallasnews.com\">watchdog@dallasnews.com</email> to join.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are several thousand Texans who want to fix the unfair property tax system, punish deceptive electricity companies, get protections from crooked roofers and, in our newest cause, enact a strong data security law to protect Texans\u2019 privacy from data miners.</p><p>The Watchdog has tips on how to write to lawmakers now if you want to get involved. But a couple of quick stories:</p><p>Story #1. It\u2019s 1996. Several hundred community members are on buses taking us to Austin to a meeting of the Texas Transportation Commission. We want money to expand Texas 114 from Grapevine to soon-to-open Texas Motor Speedway.</p><p>We wear nerdy ball caps that say \u201c114.\u201d We present a petition with 20,000 signatures.</p><p>But then one of our leaders presents a cache of children\u2019s crayon drawings that depict the hazards of the roadway. One showed a mother who was killed in a roadway accident.</p><p>\u201cThis is a first,\u201d a commissioner said.</p><p>The money came through. Hundreds of millions of dollars. You can drive on the results.</p><p>Moral: A letter is not the only way to persuade leaders to help. An emotional appeal that tugs at heart strings can get the job done. Sometimes crayons do the trick.</p><p>Story #2: A state senator recently asked me to meet him for coffee to discuss electricity companies. One thing he said: \u201cI don\u2019t get any mail on this from people.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. You want mail?</p><p>Posse!

My suggestion is for you to draft a letter the posse members can send. Sincerely, Wayne Whitman of Hurst\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Whitman, your suggestion could not have come at a better time. Friday was the deadline to introduce bills at the Texas Legislature. Now that we know what cards are on the table, the posse can figure out what hands to play.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The posse are readers of this column, plus people in the DallasNews Watchdog Posse group on Facebook, and those who receive a periodic \"action newsletter\" from me. (Write to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:watchdog@dallasnews.com\">watchdog@dallasnews.com</email> to join.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We are several thousand Texans who want to fix the unfair property tax system, punish deceptive electricity companies, get protections from crooked roofers and, in our newest cause, enact a strong data security law to protect Texans' privacy from data miners.</p><p> The Watchdog has tips on how to write to lawmakers now if you want to get involved. But a couple of quick stories.</p><p> Story #1. It's 1996. Several hundred community members are on buses taking us to Austin to a meeting of the Texas Transportation Commission. We want money to expand Texas 114 from Grapevine to soon-to-open Texas Motor Speedway.</p><p> We wear nerdy ballcaps that say \"114.\" We present a petition with 20,000 signatures.</p><p> But then one of our leaders presents a cache of children's crayon drawings that depict the hazards of the roadway. One showed a mother who was killed in a roadway accident.</p><p> \"This is a first,\" a commissioner said.</p><p> The money came through. Hundreds of millions of dollars. You can drive on the results.</p><p> Moral: A letter is not the only way to persuade leaders to help. An emotional appeal that tugs at heart strings can get the job done. Sometimes crayons do the trick.</p><p> Story #2: A state senator recently asked me to meet him for coffee to discuss electricity companies. One thing he said: \"I don't get any mail on this from people.\"</p><p> Hmmm. You want mail?</p><p> Posse! Ten-hut!</p><p> Top consumer issues</p><p> We don't have any bills that will fix the electricity system.</p><p> For crooked roofers, we have House Bill 2101 and its companion bill, Senate Bill 1168, which would create the state's first modern roofers' registry system with civil and criminal penalties for the bad guys.</p><p> For property tax reform, we have the big one - Senate Bill 2.

British 30-year bonds now offer almost the same yield as their Japanese counterparts.</p><p>Two factors are at work. The first is the plunge in bond yields around the world, a result of the collapse in consumption and rise in savings, and forceful monetary easing from central banks.</p><p>The second is the fact that Japan stands out as a country that had no real room to cut interest rates before the pandemic and where yields have changed little this year. In fact, the 30-year yield is moderately higher than at the end of 2019.</p><p>That is proof, if more were needed, that there are realistic limits to how far south it is possible or sensible to push bond yields.

Some customers have taken to Facebook, saying that loans they had obtained from the bank had been wiped in their (customer) record of the system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you have debts/loans, I suggest you check them. I have just had a couple (of) people with CBA loans wiped,\" says one customer on Facebook. \"OMG, just checked mine &amp; my housing loan is gone,\" says another. \"Just checked as soon as I saw this and my personal loan with CBA is gone!\" says a third.</p><p>The bank tonight says it is still working on fixing the system meltdown. \"We're still working to resolve the issue affecting some customers making payments with their CBA credit or debit card, as well as some services in the CommBank app and NetBank,\" it says.</p><p>The bank has recommended ways for affected customers to access cash. \"Customers with a CBA debit card, or a CBA credit card linked to their transaction account, can continue to make EFTPOS payments. To do so, insert the card into the EFTPOS device, select either savings or cheque, (and) enter your PIN code.</p><p>\"Alternatively, ATMs continue to be available for withdrawals. Credit card cash advances may not be available.</p><p>\"In addition, we are aware customers continue to experience issues with viewing accounts and statements for some home loan, credit card, transaction and savings accounts in the CommBank app and NetBank, (with) using cardless cash, making some transfers and payments in the CommBank app and NetBank.</p><p>\"We apologise for this inconvenience and thank you for your patience as we work to resolve this.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.30pm: </emphasis>Facebook responds to 'hate speech' boycott            </p><p>The sense of crisis enveloping the social media giants is deepening, as major brands continue to leave Facebook, and in some cases social media altogether, due to what they say is inaction on dealing with hate speech.</p><p>Some of the world's most influential advertisers including Coca Cola, Ford, Starbucks and Unilever have pulled millions of dollars worth of advertising from Facebook in recent days, declaring that they don't want to be associated with perceived hateful content.</p><p>The boycott is part of a global campaign, dubbed Stop Hate for Profit, which has enlisted hundreds of companies in the wake of Black Lives Matter rallies and the death of George Floyd.</p><p>The unrest has now spread to Australia. Telstra told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Australian</emphasis> is monitoring the situation and mulling its options.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-responds-to-hate-speech-boycott/news-story/2213939fddcd92ac79cef288f1635027\">\ufeffRead more</url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.10pm: </emphasis>               Flagship Telstra store hit by COVID-19 outbreak            </p><p>Australia's biggest telco Telstra has been forced to close its biggest Melbourne store, after three employees tested positive for coronavirus.</p><p>\"Our Telstra Discovery store on Bourke Street was closed on Friday afternoon and over the weekend after a staff member returned a positive COVID test result on Friday. Over the weekend, two more staff members also returned positive tests,\" a Telstra spokesman told The Australian.</p><p>\"The three team members are quarantining and other staff who worked with them are now self-isolating.</p><p/><p>\"We're working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services to help in contact tracing customers who may have been in contact with the team members last week.</p><p> \"The store has received a deep clean over the weekend and will reopen today staffed by team members from other stores.</p><p>\"The health and safety of our team members and customers is Telstra's top priority - and we look forward to welcoming back customers today and Discovery store staff as soon as they've received the necessary clearances.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.00pm: </emphasis>France places limits on Huawei 5G            </p><p>France has placed limits on the use of Huawei equipment on its next-generation 5G wireless market. The China telecommunications company is not totally banned from France's 5G wireless market, but French operators using them will only get limited licences, the head of the national cybersecurity agency told Les Echos newspaper Sunday.</p><p>The comments were the latest development in the controversy over Huawei's involvement, after several Western nations barred the company from participation in their 5G networks over security fears.</p><p>\"The operators who don't use Huawei, we encourage them not to go that way because it's kind of the natural way of things,\" said Guillaume Poupard, the head of France's national cybersecurity agency ANSSI. \"For those who are already using it, we issue permits that last between three and eight years,\" he told Les Echos.</p><p>Those restrictions will likely limit Huawei's access to France's 5G network. Huawei has invested billions of dollars in the technology, competing mainly against Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Huawei has said it will pull out of partnerships with any hostile countries and focus on working with countries where they are welcome.</p><p>In Britain meanwhile, Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6 who backed the involvement of Huawei in Britain's 5G network, now says it should be excluded, The Times has reported.</p><p>His intervention came as the National Cyber Security Centre concluded that the Chinese company's products were not secure after America banned it from using US components.</p><p>Sir John, writing in the Financial Times, said: \"The Trump administration's motives for trying to destroy Huawei can be debated. But the latest US sanctions, at the end of June and last week, mean that reliable non-Chinese suppliers to Huawei can no longer work with the company. UK intelligence services can therefore no longer provide the needed assurances that Chinese-made equipment is still safe to use in the UK's telecoms network.\"</p><p>Conservative MPs have warned Boris Johnson that plans to strip Huawei out of the 5G network by 2029 would be \"too late\". Mr Johnson is expected to bar telecoms companies from buying new equipment from Huawei by the end of the year, with a view to removing it from the 5G network entirely by 2029, The Times reported.</p><p>With AFP &amp; The Times</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bar-huawei-from-our-5g-advises-ex-security-chief-john-sawers-xjjw20ls3\">Read more.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.35pm: </emphasis>CommBank suffering mass outage            </p><p>The Commonwealth Bank is suffering a widespread outage, with customers unable to access their mobile banking app and in some cases not make retail payments.</p><p/><p>\"My account balances are all messed up.

The aim is to clearly delineate new legal boundaries for tech companies, rather than just apply existing laws covering fields such as antitrust regulation.</p><p>\"It's a full complex of things. It's not done with just one piece of legislation,\" Ms. Vestager says. In her prior term as European competition commissioner, she levied record fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay Ireland $US14.5bn ($21bn) in allegedly unpaid taxes. Last year she was promoted to vice president of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in charge of competition and new legislation for the digital sector.</p><p>\"After the first mandate and the first specific competition cases, what I have seen very clearly is that we need rigorous competition-law enforcement, but we also need regulation,\" she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-aaa7dede08fbfdb3aad01a0858204925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-NP41-DY66-51FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2513\"/><timeReceived>6:18 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thank you very much for joining us today at our 2019 Capital Markets Day. We are delighted to have you all here. I think we've got a very exciting view. You can see the agenda behind me on the screen. We'll start off with Max, our CEO, talking about our strategy and our key growth drivers. We will then move on to product. We'll have Mark Winterburn, our Chief Product Officer, giving you an overview of how we invest in our product, and we've got 6 of our product directors on stage for you today, giving you some insight into how we address the 6 key drivers of growth that Temenos has. We will then move on to Alexa Guenoun, our Chief Client Officer, who will be talking about our implementation and our partner work.</p><p>We're delighted to have one of our clients here, Bank Leumi, who will talk about their transmission journey as well and how they partner with Temenos. And then we'll finish up with Takis, our CFO, talking about how we drive and create shareholder value and Kalliopi, who is our director of CSR, talking about our corporate social responsibility.</p><p>We will not be giving any trading update. We're in the middle of Q2, so please refrain from questions on the quarter. And I'd encourage you to use the coffee break and the lunch session to network with the Temenos management team, ask questions that -- during that period. And we'll also have a Q&amp;A panel at the end for any further questions. So with that, I will hand straight over to Max to kick off the session.</p><p>MAX CHUARD, CEO, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Adam. Good morning. And thank you for coming this morning in this amazing venue and such a nice day as well. Recently I was having coffee with some of you and I can see the excitement about the announcement we made this morning about the excitement about what we are going to present today. So let's get started.</p><p>We meet almost every quarter. We speak on a quarterly basis. I think it's very important that once a year, we step back from the quarters, or specifically the year, and we look at Temenos on a broader basis, and we look at the trends, we look at what we've achieved and where we are going, which is exactly what we want to do today.</p><p>Now if we look at what we've achieved in the past, the trend is extremely clear. We've been growing sustainably, predictably at more than 20% year-over-year. So how have we done that? Why have we been able to deliver that growth? Well, first of all, we operate in a huge market. It's a $57 billion market, and it is growing as well. And still today banks -- they still build by far most of the software figures, still 80% of the $57 billion is done in-house. So a massive opportunity and a growing one.</p><p>We are already the leader in that market, already we are the vendor of choice with credibility, with references, with scale that allows us to invest more than anyone else. So already we are there. And we benefit from 6 drivers of growth, and we discussed those in much more detail. And so far, we've not yet benefited from all of them, we focus more on one of them, and we'll see why now we've got all the company aligned to deliver on those 6 drivers of growth.</p><p>It's not anymore about Temenos only. It's a community. It's an ecosystem of partners. We've got 6,000 trained consultants on our software. It's about 3,000 customers, and I know some of you came to our TCF, which is our yearly customer event, and we've had 2,000 people in that room that wants to be part of that community where we share to get benefits of being part of that club. And obviously, over the years, we've very nicely complemented and accelerate our growth through bolt-on acquisitions.</p><p>Now there is one message and the way we've structured the day is to give you the comfort that what we've achieved in the past is sustainable for the long term. And we'll discuss why this is the case that Temenos has everything to continue and deliver long-term sustainable license growth at more than 50%. That's super exciting. That's super exciting, who can say that they've got such a future? And we'll discuss each of the elements why this is the case.</p><p>Let me start, if that's okay with you, with looking in more detail at the market where we operate. So the market where -- which is obviously our opportunity, as I said, a very large market, $57 billion and growing, growing at a 5% compound growth per year. And most of its spend is in-house. Because historically, in the '60s and '70s, banks have built their own software. And all the majority of the spending that is done in-house does not go to innovate, does not go to creating products. It goes to maintain the legacy software that have been built in the '60s and '70s.</p><p>And they understand that there is an urgency to change. So there is an urgency to transform, to be able to adapt in a digital environment. And clearly, you can see that the growth goes to third-party software, packaged software, upgradable software, where you can continuously bring innovation to the customer.</p><p>So our addressable markets right now is at 20%. This $12 billion growing 8% on average, clearly, as we've seen, we've grown much faster than that, at more than 20%. So we've been gaining market share. And remember, this is a winner-take-it-all market. At the end, you will have one winner out of there. And Temenos is clearly on that way. That's very exciting. So a very large market, growing, we've been gaining market share, and we'll continue to grow faster than the competition.</p><p>And there's an urgency, an urgency to change that has never been greater. It is recognized by everyone, by the banks themselves, by industry analysts experts. Never before they had so many multiple structural drivers for the bank to change. It's much tougher for the banks today. In the past, banks used to enjoy more than 10% return on equity. That's not the case anymore. Clearly, through -- after the financial crisis in 2008, the returns have dramatically reduced. So they need to do something, they cannot operate like that. And when we talk to CEO of banks, that's one of the main concern, how do they bring back profitability?</p><p>Regulation over the years has massive increase. And even some countries where regulation is less, they're still looking at adapting the standards of the -- from a governance point of view. Look at open banking and what it does to banks. So clearly, regulation has been clearly a big driver.</p><p>Customer base changed. Customer expect the Amazon-like experience from the banks. Why can you not get that from your bank? And you will see from Leumi later on, how banking can be cooler, and you see what they've done, which is very exciting. So the customer is expecting a different experiences. But how can you offer that experiences if you still operate on a siloed basis? How can you have seamless end-to-end experience?</p><p>And you've got new competitors, new entrants in the market. You get new banks, new digital banks, like we discussed what Pepper did with Leumi, how they are challenging the incumbent vendors because of technology. Technology today allows bank to go up within weeks on the cloud with a new platform, they are nimble, very innovative.</p><p>So never before we've had so many multiple structural drivers for the banks to change, to innovate. And clearly, they understand. I've said that there is a need to transform. There's a need to be -- to innovate, to be more agile. However, they cannot do that with the legacy systems. Clearly, hindered by the legacy systems that don't allow them to operate. And remember, those legacy systems built pre the Internet age. In computer language, that is not teached anymore with hardware, which is extremely expensive, with thousands of people that are maintaining that software. And the risk related to that, the single point of failure in every of those silos is huge, very poor customer experiences by operating on a siloed basis, that need to change. We are in a time of innovation, of speed to innovation.</p><p>We need to continuously innovate. How can you do that with a legacy system? You cannot. Speed to market, which is key, cannot be delivered. You'll hear as well from our customers, why can't you open -- you cannot open an account within seconds of minutes? Why does it take weeks, months to launch new products? It's because of the infrastructure, the legacy infrastructure. And obviously, you cannot benefit from all that data. How can you not -- you cannot benefit from the data from the customer experiences, and basically, through AI, you cannot bring in new product to market. So clearly, banks are hindered by the legacy systems.</p><p>Now let's look at how we position ourselves in the future. And today and how, what are our ambitions for that market. First, Temenos is uniquely positioned to transform that market. We only do that, I mean, for the last 25 years. That's the only thing that we've been doing, selling to banks, selling software to banks. It's a partnership. We are on it together, their success is our success. We've got 3,000 customers in 150 countries. What is unique about Temenos is both we lead from a banking functionality, which is packaged, which is localized with all what you need to run a bank in your country, from a tax, from a language point of view, from processes, which obviously, derisk the implementation of launching a project, but as well reduce the time to do that.</p><p>So we differentiate on having extreme package upgradable software localized for specific countries. And then, we've got advanced technology, technology which is native, cloud native, agnostic, open. We don't want to force our customers into a single stack. We give choices. In an environment where technology move so fast, you need to be open. You need to give choices to the banks for them to decide which technology they want to go for.</p><p>So this is where we are unique and nobody has this in the market, both the packaging and the advanced technology. And all of that is because we have a relentless focus on innovation. We are a product company, that's what we do. Day in, day out, that's what we think. We spend 20% of our sales on the product every year. That's more than anyone, more than our customers. As I've said, we have this ecosystem already in place. With 6,000 partners trained on our software.</p><p>We even have now a platform, which we call, TLC, which allows banks to train -- we industrialize our training for our partners to give us scale. So this is what is unique about Temenos. And only Temenos, because of those attributes, can dramatically reduce the cost of transformation and bring agility and innovation to our customers, only Temenos can do that.</p><p>We are already the vendor of choice, already and if you like it here it's -- looking at the core banking specifically, over the last 5 years, we outsell our competitors by an average of 5x over that period of time, 5x. And if you look at our closest competitor, more than twice, we sell more than twice as them. And you know, we say it many times, software is a winner-take-it-all and we've seen it in other industries, because at some stage, you've got so much more credibility, more scale, more references, you can invest much more in the product that the #2 and the #3 cannot cope anymore. And that's why there is 1 vendor of choice at the end.</p><p>And that leadership is accelerating. Look at how we compete against our closest competitor, Accenture, in 2018, an acceleration of that leadership. And now, you've all heard of our new product that we launched, Temenos Infinity, Temenos T24 Transact, which are game-changing product and those products will even accelerate our leadership in the future.</p><p>It's always great as well to be recognized by independent third-party experts. So you can see here IBS, which issue a league table. And we've announced this morning that once again, we are at the top of that league. We've been the best-selling core banking firm for last 14 years. But we now start as well to make inroads in our different products on digital, on payments as well we've been #1 vendor. Forrester as well another research, who's been named again for the last 12 years consecutively the best vendor for new name and for new and existing names. So very exciting to be also recognized by the industry -- independent industry experts.</p><p>Now we benefit from 6 drivers of growth. And let's be frank, up to now, we've really only sold -- the majority of what we sell continues to be T24 Transact, that's the majority of what we do today. A large market, a $5 billion market, growing up 7%. But now we've got 6 drivers. We've never had so many products to sell, and that's super exciting. Look at Infinity, through the acquisition of Avoka that we did at the end of last year, we've got now end-to-end digital front office platform. And the front office is as big as the back office and growing faster at 8%. And this is totally independent, you can sell Infinity with banks using a different core at the back all of that integrated through APIs, wealth, payment, funds, SaaS. Never before we've had such an opportunity.</p><p>So what you are going to hear today and you are going to hear it from our product leaders as well, from our services organization, how we are structured internally end-to-end around those 6 drivers of growth to ensure we capture the opportunity for each of those products. Clearly, core or T24 Transact is where we've had our leadership so far, the largest part of our leadership, and we've got today 16% market share. This is on a global basis. So clearly, internationally, the -- our market share will be higher than that, in the range of 20% to 25%. And in the U.S., will be lower, probably around the 5%. So a global market share of 16%.</p><p>Now remember, this is a growing market. Remember, we've been growing market share. We've been growing faster than the competition. And we've got today more than 700 customers on core, 750 customers on core. We've got credibility. So clearly, our goal for the future for the long term is at least to double that leadership and that market share in core.</p><p>Now at the same time, if you look at all the other products, we capture combined 5% market share. Of these, some of them have a higher market share, this is an average. Like funds we've made very good inroads and Oded will say more about that. But others, like payments with a smaller market share, but growing as well. There is no reason why we cannot get those other products to the same leadership position as we enjoy on the core side. No reason. In fact, we did all the hard work on the core when we start selling to the smaller banks, getting the credibility, getting the references, getting the partners, all of that is done. So all of that -- our other products will benefit from it. So for the future, for the long term, we want to take the other product to the same leadership as where we are today on core, so to at least triple our penetration in these other products.</p><p>Tier 1 and Tier 2 represent around 2/3 of the spending. And today, we've penetrated around a 1/3 of those Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. So we do business with around a 1/3 of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks globally. Clearly, in Europe, which is where we started, we have a larger penetration, which, as you can see, is growing as well. And in other regions, like in the Americas or in Asia, we have a smaller one but as well growing.</p><p>As you know, the last 5 years, we gain most of the large deals that came to market, the majority of the large deals that came to market. So we want to continue to gain those deals. There is no reason why we are not going to continue to do that because we've got the credibility, the references. And obviously, we want to expand on what we do with those large banks. It is about continuously reinnovating a bank. It is about a partnership and Ilan from Leumi will discuss it later on, it's a partnership for the long term. And those are the discussions we have with the customers is how do we transform continuously the bank.</p><p>Obviously, we love to sign new Tier 1 banks because it give us an entry point and then we can grow that relationship. So today, we captured less than 5% of the wallet share of the large -- of those large banks. And in the future, we want to at least double that. And you can see on the right-hand side that, that spending has been growing by at least 30% year-over-year on a CAGR basis.</p><p>Let's look at the future now. Let's look at our strategic initiative and how those will support ultimately our end goal of growing sustainability our license by at least 15%. So those initiatives to drive growth obviously are centered around investment -- continued investment and enhancing of our winning solutions, our products to accelerate and also to open up new markets. It is about geographic expansions in strategic markets and we'll discuss, obviously, the U.S. specifically. It is about investing in sales, in specialized sales, in cloud and SaaS, talent, people. It is about nurturing that partner ecosystem to support our growth, to give us scale. And also obviously -- it is also to continue to acquire companies that can accelerate our growth. Obviously, we continue to do that by operating on the socially and responsibly way, which is the only way to sustain growth for the future.</p><p>So if we look at our products, in essence what we've done, obviously, you've all seen and we've discussed quite a bit our new product, cloud native, cloud agnostic. The benefit of that is huge. The ability to elastically scale up and down and really to use on demand for what you need, to have the resilience that clouds offers, multi-cloud active active. Nobody offers that. Nobody can offer that. You can run it on Azure. You can run it on AWS. If one drops, it continues without any interaction on the other one. Cloud agnostic, we offer choice to our customers.</p><p>The choice of the technology because technology move so fast, innovation move so fast, you cannot lock them in a specific stack, they need to have the choices. They need to have the ability to choose from a cost point of view, from a performance point of view. We operate in an environment where speed of innovation is so important, and we'll continue on that way. How to launch product faster, how to build, test in the morning and you deploy in the afternoon, how to continuously innovate. It's obviously about being APIs first. We have more than 400 APIs today. We distribute those APIs with our software, you can even found them in our development -- autonomous development portal. And these -- faster the -- with those APIs, you can rapidly integrate. And it innovate at a lower risk and cost.</p><p>And obviously, it is also about opening new markets. And we've announced earlier this year, a strategic collaboration with Bloomberg and Oded will give us an update on this how to open a new market, in this case on the buy side, a $5 billion technology market. And hopefully, Oded, our first deal since Q2. So that's on this product side.</p><p>Clearly, expanding the market, expanding our strategic market. I'm pleased the U.S., which represent between 35% and 40% of the spending is a key market for us. I'm very pleased that we've made major progress over the years. Just in 2018, we reached $100 million firm use in the U.S. So we've got scale. 430 employees, 16% of our license in 2018 came from the U.S., 7 offices.</p><p>And clearly, the acquisition of Avoka is giving even more momentum to our U.S. strategy. And we had major success with companies like Commerce, PayPal. New entrants like Varo, Grasshopper. So very pleased.</p><p>Our strategies for the U.S. is extremely clear. So we continue to focus at the top end of the market with all our products. Those are the institutions with more than $10 billion. It's around 120 of them. And we've seen strong progress. And just to give you an example, we signed a very strategic account in Q4 of last year for Infinity. And they get the benefit of Infinity and the discussion is now, but why don't we get the full benefit of your platform because they are still using their homegrown legacy software at the back. So now we are starting to have a discussion, but why don't we change the back, you'll get the full benefit on the Infinity side. So there is scale now in the U.S.</p><p>Then, with Infinity or with now -- with the acquisition of Avoka, which gave us this end-to-end Digital Front Office Platform, we can also address the midmarket. So the $3 billion to around $10 billion asset under management, and there you've got around a bit more than 1,000 institutions in that market. Already Avoka around 50 customers in that market. So also very exciting to be able to further develop that midmarket.</p><p>And obviously, we'll continue as we've done with Varo with Grasshopper to continue to capture the new entrants, the new banks of that market. It is about investing in sales. We've been investing in sales for the last 3 years at 30% per year. But it's also about investing for those initiatives, those 6 drivers of growth. That's where we invest now in specialization.</p><p>So you can see here how we track our investment in sales. Clearly, you can see at the top that Infinity, because of the acquisition of Avoka, where we got a lot of skill from that team. We're almost there on the Infinity side. There's still a little bit on Transact, but we're quite well ahead. And Wealth and Payments is probably where we need to invest more. I think we're probably 2/3 of the way on the specialization, and we'll be there by the end of 2020. So continuous investment in sales and presales obviously.</p><p>Being the leader in the market, a winner means winner. And that's why we've been able to attract talent at Temenos. But at the same time, we did what you call our Sales Academy so that internally, we are able to train and mentor new talent to deliver on that growth.</p><p>SaaS and cloud, I mean, that's super exciting what technology allow you to do. And look at how this has grown over the years. We were the first in 2011 to talk about cloud first. We've got 33 core clients on our cloud offering, 400 clients in total. It's an organization within Temenos, and Andrew will discuss later on, with 120 employees just focusing on that. And it has growing -- it is growing extremely faster. It grew by a multiple of 6x the total contract value on the LTM. And I know that we've not been very transparent with you so far on our different metrics on SaaS and cloud. And Takis later on is going to give you more information on that side so that you can better model the opportunity that we are addressing on our cloud and SaaS business.</p><p>It is about our partner ecosystem, which is growing to support us -- to support our growth. You know that in 2018, every single working day, the bank was going live on our software, every day. We've had 233 go-live in 2018. Almost 1,500 go-live in the last 8 years. And that we've achieved because of our partners. We couldn't do it without them. And they are very excited, because they see, they understand the growth, which is in front of us. We've rolled to them a training platform, which is basically -- that has industrialized the training for them, which we call TLC, Temenos Learning Community. And since then, we've seen a huge growth of people going and getting trained. Today, 6,000 of them are skilled on our software.</p><p>As we've done for the past, we'll continue to use tuck-in M&amp;A to complement our growth. It is about how can we capture a bigger piece of that $57 billion market, which is a huge market in banking. How can we get more from that? And if we see -- if we find a company that can get us there faster, definitely, we've got all the mean to be able to do that acquisition. So M&amp;A will be about accelerating growth in key geographies, as we've said, as we've done very successfully over the years. Clearly, in the U.S., has been one way. Australia, remember when we bought Rubik? And since we bought Rubik 2 years ago, Australia has become a very material market for us in Asia Pacific. It is about as well buying some complementary products like what we've done with Avoka, which very nicely complements our Digital Front Office platform. And now, we've got so much momentum with Infinity.</p><p>And finally about increased scale. Even though today, we do have the scale, but sometimes we bought some competitors and then moved them on our platform.</p><p>So our ambitions and how we are going to deliver sustainable and long-term growth, it's about our huge market, a growing market, remember. It is about already being recognized and leading that market and having all the benefit of being the leader, investing more in the product. Credibility, a community of -- with our customers, with our partners. We benefit from 6 drivers of growth. Never before we had so many products. Never before we had an organization aligned end-to-end around those 6 drivers of growth. It's our partners that give us scale, that give us ability to grow faster. And it is about accelerating growth -- organic growth through bolt-on acquisitions.</p><p>Now I've been with Temenos for 17 years, and never before it was so exciting. And it is not because I'm the new CEO of Temenos, maybe a little bit, but it's because for the last 25 years, we've built the credibility. We've built those references. We've built the partner ecosystem and we've got scale. We'll be $1 billion this year of revenues. And we're seeing it again and again in other industries. When you get to $1 billion -- and there's nothing magic about $1 billion, but the fact that you get to $1 billion mean that you've got the credibility. You've got those references. You've got that partner ecosystem. And what we've seen in all the software industries, when you get there, growth accelerates. When you get there, you become the category killer in that specific market. And this is what we want to do. This is we want to be the category killer in banking. That's what we want to do. And we are extremely well placed. So this is why it's very exciting times at Temenos right now. Thank you very much.</p><p>So Mark now is going to walk us through our different products and how those products are so aligned on our 6 drivers of growth. Thank you, Mark. Thank you.</p><p>MARK WINTERBURN, CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, TEMENOS AG: Good morning, everyone. My name is Mark Winterburn. I run the product group at Temenos. Adam and the team are now very worried, because they've a lot of product on to the stage and we like to talk about products a lot. So he's very worried that we'll be late and overrun. So I'll try not to let him down.</p><p>Just a few minutes from me just as some context. So as you've heard Max, it is a very exciting time to be in the company. Many things have aligned. Lots of good work in previous years has come together with work we've done more recently. There is, across the company, a relentless focus on development, on incremental change and transformational change. And a little bit later, because I know I've spoken to some of you guys before, you're interested in how we manage the investments around those things. So I'm going to talk to that in a little bit. But we do spend approximately 20% of revenues in the development program. We're in a very virtuous circle at the moment. We win deals, we hire more talent. We have more talent, we win more deals. We innovate the software further. We can hire horizontal experts from across the industry. We take on young talent on a regular basis. So it genuinely is a virtuous circle, and that allows us to do more, because we've got a single code base.</p><p>Max talked about the 6 drivers for growth. You can independently employ those, but they are built from the same design, principles, the same commitment to open and to customer choice. So each person day invested in that adds to that growing category killer, as Max referred to it. So that relentless focus, that relentless commitment brings greater and greater benefits as we go forward. So I guess, you could say in a couple of different ways in the sense that the 25 years investment in feature function that allows us to incrementally add and change that as we go, that is a massive barrier to our competition. You just cannot recreate the depth and the breadth that we have in the feature function. In a previous life, I've had a go, trust me, it's incredibly difficult. So that incremental every day, we want to add a bit more breadth or a bit more depth to the various categories we sell software in, we can do that, because we've got the base. It's much easier to add to -- and to change than build from scratch.</p><p>And then the revolutionary approach to technology. So much of what we've done recently with the creation of Infinity, the cloud -- first cloud agnostic piece has been us building on investments we've made in technology in the prior 10 years. And trust me, we've got a world-class technology group, no doubt about that. So people can run their software on the cloud, but can they leverage properly, fully that software on the cloud? So they can be cloud-compatible, but are they truly cloud first? Does the software scale up and down immediately by chunk rather than just running a very large piece of software. So there's some revolutionary technology that we deployed, and we continue to deploy that very regularly. So cloud feels natural to us, the way we build our own software. I'm going to talk about continuous deployment a bit later, but that's how we build software. We spin up instances in the cloud. We run hundreds of thousands of tests every night. And then that software is good to go the next day. So we do it every day. We'll soon be at a state where we can run it multiple times in a day. So when we talk about continuous deployment, it's merely the deployment of what we do in-house, taking that technology and allowing our clients to deploy it.</p><p>180,000 person days in 2018, will be more than 200,000 days this year, because we have a commitment to grow the R&amp;D group. So we'll put more days in this year than we did last and we did more last year than we did the year before. There is so much for us to build at and build upon. That is something that feels very healthy to me.</p><p>This ongoing commitment is just a daily event. So we could be talking about trade finance. We could be talking about, I don't know, corporate lending. We could be talking about funds administration. It doesn't really matter what it is. We are building something out even more depth or more breadth every day. That's our mindset.</p><p>I wanted to try and capture the 6 drivers kind of on one page. So Infinity, the Digital Front Office, that can connect to any in-house or legacy core. So then, it needs to use a T24 Transact. Clearly, you get also some benefits if you do. But that's why we're so excited about Infinity. It allows banks to take our commitment to open to transformational and take their -- and leave their legal existing back-office where it is, leverage us, put differentiation, personalization into the front, and then as and when they are ready, migrate their back-office via a number of different methods to do that, which Alexa will talk about in a bit more detail later. But it does allow us -- Max mentioned a sale in Q4 last year. That was a platform play. The bank saw that it could take that digital transformation step, and later in its own time, take advantages more easily from the full Temenos stack. So that's why we're so excited about the Infinity, the Digital Front Office, which Darryl will come and talk about.</p><p>Clearly, we all know T24 Transact, the flagship leading core banking solution, massively scalable, deployable quickly and at very low cost. So banks that want to concentrate on huge volume are manufacturing readymade platform with huge depth and breadth of functionality. So they're the 2, if you will, core pieces.</p><p>Then WealthSuite, most of you know we've been big in WealthSuite for a long time. That allows through the front office to differentiate and through the wealth back office huge efficiencies for the various relationship managers, et cetera, so world-class offering there.</p><p>Payments, we built using the same architecture and design principles as T24 as it was at the time. Again, highly scalable, simple to implement, very flexible, real-time instant payments, can be deployed as a stand-alone payment solution against the normal incumbents, if you will, or embedded inside Transact. So we've seen a lot of growth in that, which kind of expected, because we knew the quality of what we were building some years ago.</p><p>And then fund admin, any product type, any asset type across a highly scalable single platform. So again, as Max mentioned, a serious solution there. And then finally, the -- all of this available on premise on -- through SaaS platform, completely agnostic. If you want to use a particular provider for cloud, we're there. And as Max said, the ability to go active-active across different cloud providers.</p><p>So this kind of is the big picture, but this is where the investment goes, this ability to offer our customers choice. Banks however small, however large, offer them the choice of the software they deploy on and the method by which they deploy.</p><p>Something I spoke to a number of you about and you'll be familiar with, but just to recap, the key to this is that the core solution, what we will call Level 1. So that's the core of the system, that's applicable to any of our clients wrapped around a model bank with a set of model bank procedures, which I think is now around 1,000 processes. So that's how the banks take the software in their initial deployment. Then what we would call Level 2, so this is take the bank, but now we're in a specific zone, location, so a country model, if you will, to allow the software to work as well in France or Germany or whatever. So that's the Level 2. And then finally, the bank-specific pieces, the -- usually are done by configurational parameterization that allow the bank to make the software its own, if you will, in terms of the way it personalizes and differentiates through its clients.</p><p>So that ability for us in a productized, repeatable, upgradable packaged approach, which allows all the investment to go into reusable product regardless of whether it's L1 or L2, it is what's at the heart of it. So it allows us to be live in over 100 countries and yet not have that enormous complexity of trying to maintain that. So very, very proud of that as something that's been in the system a long time. We've just productized that and make it look like L1 throughout that stack. So very pleased with that. Makes it very easy for our customers to deploy multi-country solutions.</p><p>Just a little bit about the investments. So clearly, with the interaction with the market, we get input from literally hundreds of sources. So broadly, our customers will talk to us about do we offer this, could we offer this, et cetera, prospects, when you were talking about the possibility for them to use our software, those kinds of things; partners, another good source; and obviously, our staff. Our staff are interacting in the market all the time, coming back with ideas, with the ways to innovate the products.</p><p>We have the rational tool set, which just allows us to capture those possible investments in the products, to document those, and then they go through a very rigorous process where -- we have a whole bunch of governance be there, so the daily, weekly, monthly culminating in the product board. The product manager for that business thinks it's a good idea, writes a little vision and scope, as we call it. If we get through that, then there'll be a proper appropriate investment. This is done through on a formal monthly basis, with the C level of the company reviewing have we done what said we would, but also what are the new investment opportunities we might have identified. Does the company think these are the right things for us to invest in.</p><p>So that 180,000 days, the 200,000 days this year, that is through this process, all right? Taking inputs from wherever, putting it in through a funnel, a proper documented productized process and then the output, as I showed you in previous dialog, it could be L1, could be L2, could be something for a specific customer or it doesn't make the cut. And that process is happening around the world through the rational tool set on a daily basis. So that's how we make the investment decisions. That's how we decide where to place out that [service.]</p><p>I said I'll talk a little bit about the continuous deployment. So having built all this great product, how to -- how the banks make choices about the way they want to deploy that. So this continuous deployment, as I say, comes from our own processes in our laps. So we have a process the Unified Temenos Process (sic) [Platform], UTP. And that basically takes our code, puts it through development. The development process means you check the code every day. And then overnight, it is integrated and tested and is ready to deploy the next day.</p><p>Now as I say, we're in the process now, and that's about 4 hours. So should we want to, we can start to do this more than once a day. And that's how we've been building code for a while. Some years back -- so obviously, if you're going to deploy in cloud, the way you build code has to be more granular. You have to make smaller chunks, more discrete and more packaged.</p><p>So we have to build the system like this. Now as we work more with banks, this is how banks want to deploy. So be that their own developers or code through UTP from us or from the marketplace or partners, this gives us the ability to build in the morning and consume in the afternoon. I don't know many banks yet that want to do that. But clearly, as we go forward, this idea that 6 months or 9 months is acceptable is clearly not acceptable with the levels of investment and the need to change the need for speed, this kind of model underpins pretty much any implementation methodology going forward. So we've taken what we do, and we've productized that. And it is using cloud throughout, so it's virtual machines spinning up, being used and then taken down for the testing.</p><p>So we see this is happening now. Some banks are on this journey now. Others are looking closely at this is -- is this -- when will they use this, how will they use this? So this is kind of DevOps in the industry jargon brought to life and something we're very comfortable with, something we see as quite a natural extension to the way we take our code here ready to go. Banks want to write through their development processes to a point of maybe UAT where they're ready to then take over and put it live. So this can be daily change or this can be batched into a week or a month. A number of banks we work with now want us to use this process in the codes there and then they're testing it. So we perform the work through every couple of weeks, that kind of process.</p><p>And we talked about the -- Max talked about the 6 drivers. We've got somebody, usually the product guy or dev business leader coming up to talk about them. Hopefully, you've got a -- we have a flavor from previous TCF or whatever. So now we're going to go through each of these.</p><p>And first off, it's Alex Duret.</p><p>ALEX DURET, PRODUCT DIRECTOR OF TRANSFORMATION, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Mark. Okay? Hi. So the core banking, it's our first driver of growth we have in Temenos and [here's streak 01.] What's the core banking system? In just a few words, this is the place where each and every financial institution is going to process their transactions and manage their positions. It's the heart of the bank.</p><p>This is a growing market. We estimate it to $5 billion and it keeps growing. It's been growing for years and it keeps growing. And our response to that is Temenos T24 Transact. The value proposition is very key nowadays. We're talking about digital transformation. It's to do it -- this transformation faster and cheaper via the core banking system, through innovation and through packaged and integrated functionality. It's hard, can't imagine how hard it is for our clients to transform, to go along this digital transformation path. And we're here to help and we have all the credibility with this core banking software that we keep enhancing.</p><p>In the next few slides, I'm not going to talk a lot about functionality, about retail or corporate banking, but more about the technology, because this is the theme of the current years in the short term and also probably in the longer term.</p><p>If you're following Temenos, you might be following some of our competitors as well, and they've been here for quite a long time. You have the global players. You have the regional players. And then, quite recently, we've seen a flurry of new competitors, startup companies entering the core banking market. It's very exciting for us, because it gives us a boost to do even better than we used to do in the past, because the old way of competing with an Infosys, an Oracle, okay, we know. And usually, we're quite good at that, but this new competition gives us an incentive to innovate even more.</p><p>So if we compare against all of these players, some of them are global players. We are. Some of them are not the starters by definition, cannot be. Very few are cloud-native. If you are a startup, you start with the right technology from the beginning. If you're a more established vendor, it's a lot of work to do to go through the new technology. We spent a lot of time reengineering T24 Transact to be cloud-native. So we're bringing the best of both worlds into one system that's quite unique today on the market.</p><p>Another differentiator is we're addressing all the market segments. We've been very good at having retail banks, corporates, wealth managers, treasury, Islamic, inclusive banking, we're probably the only company who can do that. So we keep all the options open, and we want to keep growing wherever there is growth in the market. And that's quite unique.</p><p>We've put a lot of effort into integrating our system. So these 6 drivers you will see us talking about today, we've put a lot of money and technology into making sure that they talk to each other. And that's also a big difference to some of the competition who come with very different systems and then they don't talk to each other. And then it's a huge cost to integrate all of that. We make sure upfront that it's all pre-integrated.</p><p>And finally, the -- I think a really key differentiator we focus a lot on the long-term upgradability of our system. We're selling a product. We're not selling services that people -- we're not selling consultants basically. We're selling a product, something that people can keep -- banks can keep upgrading year after year after year. If you buy T24 Transact today, you know that in 20 years, you'll be upgrading to release today plus 20, and it's going to work.</p><p>Okay. So what's the market saying about all of this? The key focus nowadays is digital banking, all right? This is where the main focus is in many banks, Tier 1s down to Tier 4, and will have -- they are all focusing a lot about digital banking. But still the second priority, I was going to say even surprisingly, people don't forget that for this thing to work at the front, you need a proper digital real-time core banking. So there is still a lot of investment plans by all of our prospects and clients into the core banking.</p><p>If you go down to the bottom, the funny thing here is adopt cloud services. So nowadays, it means that financial institutions still see this as a maybe fifth priority, while we think it's the foundation for everything else. We've talked about cloud a lot with Max, with Mark this morning. This is a foundation to transform all the banks from a traditional institution to digital companies. And I'll be talking about that.</p><p>The things that Mark has been talking about, the past, we've been through in terms of transforming our software to be cloud-native is what banks need to follow now. We've been through this journey, and we now have all the tools to help them go in that direction. What does it mean to be cloud-native?</p><p>In just a very few points means, first of all, a bank, it's not an IT company. A bank is not supposed to be running hundreds and thousands of machines and complex hardware and so on, on premise. You have people who do that for you. [If] you go to Amazon, you go to Google, you go to Microsoft or even Alibaba if you're in Asia. That's what these guy do, and they do it much faster and cheaper and more security than you do. So stop being IT companies, focus on banking. It's a mindset for a lot of banks. It means changing the hardware. It means also changing the way your organization is structured, not so much on maintenance and infrastructure, but more on creation, on innovation.</p><p>It's about changing the way you design your applications too. And that's for us, as Temenos, it's been the -- where we spend the most time and we keep spending time, making sure that our software is completely reengineered to work natively in the cloud. I'm not going to bore you with technical things like containers, microservices or distributed database, but that's how it works. You need your software to be nimble, to be more componentized so that it's easily interchangeable and it runs faster. This is the secret behind -- in other verticals like the Amazons or the Netflix of this world. They have a supercool user interactions, but in the background, you have also supercool core technology that runs along those same principles. And that's what we want to bring to our clients, to the banks. I -- consequence of that, once you have this technology in place, you can really become an innovation company.</p><p>DevOps, Mark has explained briefly the notion of continuous deployment, continuous integration. It means that nowadays you can very easily launch new products on the market. With T24 Transact, it's always been very easy to create new products, but what really happens in the reality, you launch this -- you create the stuff in T24. It takes a few hours, let's say, a few days if it's a bit more complex, and then what? You wait 6 month until it goes into production, because it's banking, because you need to test and retest and re-retest, to make sure that it works.</p><p>So you're wasting all this time. You have this brand cool idea, you have this software that allows you to implement it. But still you're wasting months to be able to release it to the market.</p><p>DevOps continuous integration and continuous deployment is a way to automate all of that, to automate all these tests. You push a button, you get to your environment. If you want to do, you push another button, it goes into this whole testing cycle. It's all automated, hundreds of thousands of tests. And then you're ready to ship it to your production environment. And that's how the other industries are working. That's how the Amazons and the Netflix of this world work. And that's what we are now -- we've been through with ourselves, and that's where we're ready to offer to our banks as a service.</p><p>And finally, we talk a lot about APIs. Yes, we're going to implement this core banking within another environment, which has its own complexity, other systems that the banks are going to keep. And we need to make sure that we can integrate with these -- with all these systems. So we've changed the mentality from point-to-point interface to actually APIs, open APIs.</p><p>We have a developer portal where we publish all these APIs using standard technology. And again, it's not technology for the sake of technology, is to make sure that this is going to be faster and cheaper for the banks.</p><p>A few numbers, because we like numbers. With the business value -- some examples, the tip of the iceberg is, first of all, to reduce our infrastructure costs. Okay? By 3x, 6x, 10x, I don't know. If you move all your IT infrastructure to the cloud, this is the kind of savings you can achieve. But further down the road, once you become an innovation company, you can also increase -- as a bank, you can easily increase your revenue by 15% to 20%, simply because you can innovate faster. You're launching new ideas faster. Therefore, you grow faster. Therefore, the next idea will come even faster and so on and so forth.</p><p>And in terms of orders of magnitude, let's say, we've been running some tests when moving to a micro service -- creating new micro services. And some of these things, they work a 100x faster than they used to. So it's really the technology-enabler of banking.</p><p>This is the short-term, medium-term. The next few years, we are driving this change across the banking industry. In the long-term, the fundamentals don't change. We have the breadth and depth. It's still there, our cross retail, corporate, our country model banks. That's not changing. We keep investing, and we want to keep the leads in the markets.</p><p>We innovate a lot. We've been talking about that. One thing not to forget is choice. We have hundreds and thousands of clients. If we consider all the products, we still want to give them choice. We're not going to scare anybody saying you need to move to the cloud now. We can remain on-premise. We give you an upgrade path. You want to go private cloud, you can go on a private cloud. You want to go public cloud, you can go public cloud. We keep all the options open, because we want to capture the entire market, not just a few technologists out there.</p><p>And finally, we're stable. There is new competition coming our way. They have yet to prove what they can do, whereas we know we've been through a number of financial crises, market changes and so on, and we know we have the right structure and the right products to achieve that.</p><p>So I've been talking about the heart of banking, which is the Core Banking. Let's talk now about one of the brains of it, which is the front office with Darryl.</p><p>DARRYL PROCTOR, MD OF TEMENOS INFINITY, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Alex. Thank you so much. Good morning, everybody. So how do I follow that? I follow on by telling you that a heart of the bank is core banking. But how a bank sells its product is through the software that we enable bank to do that. And that's Temenos Infinity. Temenos Infinity allows the bank to sell its product. If a bank can't sell its product, it's not going to survive. Same as if we don't sell our product, it won't survive.</p><p>Infinity gives them that ability to market their products, to acquire new customers and also to service those customers in a digital world. And that's very, very important today. It has to be cheap, it has to be digital, and it has to be digital end-to-end.</p><p>It's huge market. As Max said, it's a big -- it's a growing market. It's growing at a fast pace. And the way that we service that through our value proposition is to deliver an omni-channel platform that's enabled by APIs, so we don't look constrained. We have to have the ability to talk to FinTech partners. We have to have the ability to talk to any Core Banking engine, including T24 Transact.</p><p>But Infinity differentiates itself by leveraging 25 years of knowledge that we've had in Core Banking. It's not just about putting a wrapper and hoping that, that wrapper has something that understands banking. It is about utilizing the knowledge that we have in banking in Temenos and making sure that as we allow a bank, we enable a bank to sell its customers, that the customer of the bank understands that the bank knows what it's talking about. It's not just that layer that sits on top.</p><p>And that's really where we compete. We're full front to back digital. That's where the sweet spot lies. If a bank can service its customers 24/7, 365 digitally end-to-end, not worrying about closing the business process, you're not worrying about that. It means that the digital side all the way through to the end is looked after. It crosses all of the banking verticals as well.</p><p>So wealth management, corporate banking, SMEs, mass affluent, it covers everything in terms of banking. So Temenos Infinity has to enable a bank to service any customer that a bank may have.</p><p>And with the acquisition of Avoka that Max spoke about earlier on, it allows us to utilize best-of-breed acquiring technology. So on-boarding a customer, cross selling to that customer is massively important. And you'll be surprised how hard it is to get a journey of a customer right, from understanding what the customer wants to bringing them into the bank is a very hard thing.</p><p>If you put a field in the wrong place, the customer will abandon that journey. That's really important. That's important but understanding how you use the software. We all use our bank on a day-to-day on our mobiles. We want the bank to be in your pocket. We want the bank to be in a corpus pocket all of the time.</p><p>And that's really what it is. Infinity is the window and the door to the bank. This is how the bank gets their customers from marketing to then around product. And marketing isn't putting products on a webpage, and saying, oh, let's hope the client understands what he wants. It's about doing a needs analysis, is about bringing them down, filtering them through a decision tree to understand what product they want for the need that they have at the very moment. But once you have marketed to them, you have to be able to take them through the journey to be able to service their product, get them to buy the product from the bank. That's the key part. That's making sure that it's easy for the client to utilize the software. And then once you have them, if you don't do a good job in servicing them, you're going to lose them.</p><p>So you have to do a good job in your omni-channel solution so that you can retain the client, and ultimately, upsell more product. That's the enablement of a bank. That's the door and the window to the bank for their own customers as well as new customers to the bank. And of course, supporting all of that, as I said, is the embedded T24 Transact, that's the digital end-to-end journey. But we're going to also operate with multiple [cores], other Core Banking and software, different pieces of technology that may exist in a bank. That infrastructure, that ecosystem that a bank has, Temenos Infinity services that.</p><p>And why do we need to service that? And if you look at the way a bank traditionally manages its Digital Front Office, it's something like this. Multiple siloed systems sitting in the back. They try and create a customer experience layer that sort of sits between that and then they try and expose it via the channel.</p><p>I've heard of banks telling that they give their client a separate log info to look at their credit card versus looking at their accounts. You can't do that today. You need that one place where everything goes, but you need to understand the banking that sits underneath it. So the ability to look at an abstract, some of that function, some of that understanding of banking and products is what Temenos Infinity does.</p><p>It abstracts from that the business value so that your product catalog that a bank have the manufacturing part is distributed cleverly, intelligently and across any channel. Because you don't want a client to walk into a branch today, and then go home and look in his Internet and can't continue that journey. It has to be omni-channel but you have to understand across all of that channel, the banking business that goes with that.</p><p>And this really is the big picture. So this is the big picture of Temenos Infinity. What does this picture mean? It means that the heart of Temenos Infinity is how we service the customer. That's the CRM capability, is ability to take the client and lead him through a decision, a digital decision journey. What am I doing at my life stage right now? Am I buying a car? Am I getting married? Am I having a child? That's a decision that may result in a financial implication, allowing him to choose a product carefully through a marketing catalog that's abstracted from the Core Banking engines and using the workflow to do that and understanding what the engagement with their client might mean. Real-time engagement with the client is incredibly important. If I am looking at a piece of software, if I'm looking at my bank today, and I'm looking at the different loans, there's a reason I'm looking for that loan.</p><p>So being able to make the client a customer of one, we do that with analytics. So I'm sitting underneath all of this is data-driven journeys.</p><p>[So what's the client doing at the time that they're doing it?] And what's the product I want to market to their client as a result? Don't offer me a personal loan, if I put in I want a 25-year loan for a house. And you'll be surprised how often a banner will come up on your internet banking, but there's absolutely no relevance to what you're doing at that time. Infinity takes that away. So we allow the client to use the software based on what they're doing at the time, taking them through the sales process. And then, of course, the servicing. The servicing is as important, if not more. Cross-selling to an existing client is a lot cheaper than acquiring a new client for a bank.</p><p>So being able to aggregate accounts across different banks hugely important today. If I can see all my accounts at my bank regardless of where I bank, and remember a corporate can have thousands of accounts, it means that I'm more likely to buy a product from you. I'm more likely to use that bank to buy a product. That's what Temenos Infinity enables. It enables the heart of the bank to breathe, to run, and run as fast as it can to innovate, to change the products that they offer very quickly. A digital solution has to be able to change. It has to be agile and for a bank. And we do that through configuration, abstracting banking knowledge from the Core Banking engine, and delivering it to the banks to enable them to sell to their customers.</p><p>Surprisingly, when you're using a digital engine or a front office, a lot of what a client does is payments. It's one of the most important parts of a Digital Front Office solution. So being able to do payments front to back, hugely important.</p><p>So with that, one of the other drivers I'm going to hand over to is Sujatha to talk about payments.</p><p>SUJATHA VENKATRAMAN, PRODUCT MANAGER OF TEMENOS PAYMENTS, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Darryl. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, payments is a big market opportunity with a $2.7 billion tax spend and growing at 10% annually. With Temenos Payments, we offer a centralized payments hub for banks of any size, processing real-time payments from any channel or source.</p><p>Here's a quick view of our competitive landscape. How we compare what's stack up against our competitors, mainly payment specialist vendors. And we compare quite favorably. We have a global presence with customers spread across all geographies. Multiproduct, we are multiproduct. We come pre-integrated with Temenos products, Financial Crime Mitigation, Temenos Analytics and Compliance Modules.</p><p>Universal payment process is our big strength. We can process any type of payment through a single workflow. And hence, we have a single solution processing high-volume retail payments and high-value corporate payments. It delivers big efficiencies and ease of maintenance to our clients. And with our extensive partner ecosystem, we can deliver seamlessly anywhere across the world.</p><p>Coming to the market drivers. Payments market is in the midst of a significant disruption and the pace of disruption has accelerated with multiple drivers. There's been a sharp increase in payment volumes, with noncash transactions growing at 10% -- 13% annually. The rise of open banking is resulting in increased competition from the FinTechs and the big techs. Banks are driven to expose their services to third parties via open APIs. And instant payments is becoming mainstream with several countries across the globe adopting the scheme.</p><p>ISO 20022 is fast emerging as a global standard in financial messaging. And last but not the least, customer expectations have increased many fold.</p><p>Payments is the only product that every customer of the bank uses almost every day. And customers expect frictionless payments that are speedy, secure and convenient. Hence to protect their position in the value chain and to retain their customers, bank's payments transformation has become a priority amongst the banks. Banks need a modern payment solution. With Temenos Payments, our holistic and scalable payment solution, we are excellently placed to tap into this big market opportunity.</p><p>We have a range of proven products covering the entire payments lifecycle, from payment initiation through to compliance and analytics.</p><p>Payment order helps in seamless journeys, customer journeys, across all the channels. Temenos Payments Hub is our universal solution for efficient and high straight-through-processing.</p><p>With our flexible configuration, we allow banks to change their payment processing rules on the fly, and it delivers very high agility and speed-to-market and bringing new products to their end customers. And the Payment Repair, it's an advanced engine for intelligent repairs, and it further enhances our straight-through-processing rates. All these products are designed to work separately as well as together, providing the flexibility to tailor a payment solution, specific to our client's requirements.</p><p>And we also offer the widest range of deployment options to our clients. Temenos Payments can come embedded with T24 Transact, and operate like a single solution. Or it can be deployed stand-alone with any third-party core banking solution. And the stand-alone mode is a significant game changer for us because you can deploy T24 -- Temenos Payments without T24 Transact. A bank need not have T24 Transact to deploy Temenos Payments. And we also offer our clients the option of deploying the solution on-premise or in the cloud.</p><p>Given the strong payment proposition, we are quite well received by market analysts. We are the best-selling payment solution right now. We won the FStech award for Payment Innovation in 2018, and we are also very well rated in vendor assessments.</p><p>A big proof point of our strong payment proposition is the client uptake in the last 3 years. We went live with our first client, ABN AMRO Bank, in 2015. In 2016, we added 2 more clients. In 2017, we had 7 more. And in 2018, we won 17 new clients.</p><p>Finally, it's been quite heartening for us to see the kind of strong growth and recognition we have received in the market, and we expect this strong growth momentum to continue through '19, '20, and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Thanks very much, Sujatha. Thank you very much, everyone. And amazingly, we're about 5 minutes ahead of time. So thanks very much for the product team for that. We'll break for coffee now. And so I'm going to ask you to make your way back upstairs, I have a lift on the stairs on either side of the venue to the room we're in for the breakfast and then the registration. And to be back down here for 11:30 a.m. to start the second half of the product session. Just a quick note for anyone who hasn't found the presentation yet, it is available on our website on the Investor Relations section of the website under the Capital Markets Day tab. Let me know if you're struggling to access that at all, but it's on the website. See you shortly. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Welcome back, everyone. And I think, we'll just push straight on with the second half of the product session. We'll then be having the session on implementation of partners, and then we'll have Ilan from Bank Leumi on stage as well. So I think without any further ado, hand straight over to Pierre, who is going to talk you through our wealth offering.</p><p>PIERRE BOUQUIEAUX, PRODUCT DIRECTOR OF PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, TEMENOS AG: Good morning. So Wealth, Wealth is a quite generic term. So the way, I think, it's easy to define is wealth is really a solution banks use to service the investment needs of their customers, whether they are retail, mass affluent or ultra high-net-worth individuals. The medium-term spend is -- for the front office, wealth only is $0.6 billion. So we have a growth rate of 8%.</p><p>Our products offering or product offering is called Temenos WealthSuite. And I think the real -- the key value proposition of Temenos WealthSuite is really being able to deliver best-of-breed components in area of portfolio management, CRM and Core Banking and to deliver them as an omni-channel solutions for retail, mass affluent and ultra high-net-worths, whether they are, of course, bank users or clients and advisors.</p><p>It's a quite competitive market, and I'm sure you know some of those, almost all of our competitors. I just would like to highlight 2 of key element and 2 of our key differentiator against those competitors.</p><p>The first one is our multicomponent approach. We're really able to deliver to those people, to our banks, to our customers, if they want to just implement a front office, they can implement a front office. They want a Core Banking, they can implement a Core Banking. Of course, they want to have the full solutions, they can have the full solutions. But even when -- as an example, if you are looking at implementing a front office, if a bank has a need, for just -- a portion of performance engine, we are able to deliver that just a portion of the performance engine, so we can really go to quite a lot of details and detailed components. And that's very important.</p><p>The second important element is multisegment. A lot of banks today, I'm sure, wants to basically leverage on some economies of scales. They want to run on one platform, their retail business, their corporate business and their private banking business, their wealth business. I think we're unique. There's not a lot of -- there's no other solutions that can really deliver all of this on a single platform. And that's really 2 important differentiators. Those differentiators, together with continued investment we do in our products, are delivering us growth opportunities in 2 different streams that we can see -- again in 2 different streams. The first one is in the traditional, I would say, private banking, wealth management business we have. The second is more on the mass affluent and the retail market. I would like to come and spend a bit of time on this offer for the mass affluent and the retail markets.</p><p>If you look at some numbers, I think from the high end of the retail people, so the people that have probably around the $5,000, up to really the mass affluent and the low-end of the high-net-worths, so the people that are a bit below, the $1 million, that represents 53% of the world 's wealth. That's a huge amount of money. And quite often, a part -- a big part of this segment was mentioned as being the lost segment. Or people are also talking about unserved people. In the past, it was too expensive for retail banks to serve those people. And for private banks, the revenue were not interesting enough. So those people were left behind. Now of course, there's 2 important element that have changed, that technology is one, and the customer behavior is another one. So banks needs to deliver on that segment.</p><p>And specifically for the segment, we have launched last year a new module, it's called the robo-advisor, quite famous. And all of those modules are really tailored and targeting for the mass affluent and the retail people. You can act -- customers can act on their own. In a world of digital, they can play. They can work. They don't need to necessarily talk all the time to a relationship managers. They can roll-off this on their own.</p><p>This year, we've launched a second module, quite tied to it, which is goal-based investing. Again, quite important, this market of the mass affluent are the new generations of people who wants to invest. They're not really interesting by receiving a message like my -- the funds, I'm proposing you, there's a better performance than my competitor funds. That's not what they're looking for. What they're looking for is the ability and services that will say well, I'm ready to invest a certain amount of money today. I know I will be able to spend more money in the futures. But with all of this, and if I'm following the right strategy, if I'm following the right model, am I able to achieve a goal in maybe 5 or 10 years' time? Will I be able to acquire a holiday home in 10 years' time? That's what they're looking for, and that's the service they're looking for, and that's what we deliver with those 2 modules.</p><p>You will tell me probably that there is a quite a lot of FinTechs doing all of those things. I mean, we have key differentiator against those FinTechs. First of all, those 2 modules are completely embedded with all our solutions. So it's -- we've talked that briefly in preview -- it's in previous presentation, is fully API-driven. All of this is available through APIs. It's completely embedded also with the T24 Transact side. So not only when you define your goal and when you set them, and say, well, I want to invest $1,000 today, and I want to spend $100 on a monthly basis. Well, behind everything will be set up automatically. Transfer will be done, standing orders will be automatically put in place. All of those things is embedded. This is delivered with a Monte Carlo simulation engines allowing to really forecast those different revenues.</p><p>I mean, all of those important element are key and our key differentiators where we offer those through retail banks and to mass affluent people. Of course, you can also look at the goal-based investing, not only from a mass affluent or retail, it's also coped with a more hybrid mode because it's perfectly available also for, of course, more private and ultra high-net-worth individuals, where in this case, there's probably a bit more relationship between the relationship managers and these customers to define their goals. So we cope with all of those different element. And at the end, of course, when the orders are generated, out of the rebalancing and the robo-advisor tool, it's full STP. Orders are placed on the markets, executions are done, settlements are done, and the portfolios are all updated. All of this is quite key, and clearly, differentiators against what you find probably with something that's today in the market.</p><p>We've also spent quite a lot of investments in terms of 2 main development. The first one is around tax lots. Tax lot is really the ability for relationship managers or a portfolio managers to really manage his portfolio and run a lot of different analysis, taken -- taking into considerations the tax impact. That's valid for portfolio analysis, but it's -- of course, it's also valid when you're dealing with ordering, rebalancing, taking into account things like harvesting, wash sales, that are quite, quite important in the U.S. Of course, this development was very important for us. We have a clear focus on 2 countries to start with, the U.S. and Australia. Max has mentioned about the expansions within the U.S. That was a key element for us to expand and to support these expansions within the west market in the U.S., as well.</p><p>Next to those tax lots, we've done -- we've also done a series of developments around country model banks. So country model banks, [winning] wealth, really embeds and package a series of regulation rules with also sometimes, I would say, best practice in some countries. We all know that regulations could be understood a bit differently from one bank to another. So typically, what we offer with those country model banks is really prepacked rules that banks can tailor made to their needs or to their understanding of the regulations in order to have a very fast implementation and being able to cope quickly with all of those regulations.</p><p>So those 2 elements were quite important in order for us to expand in our traditional market into -- which is the Wealth and the Private Banking, but into new countries, the U.S. and Australia. And the country model that is also available today supporting a series of important countries like -- some of them in Asias, others in Europe.</p><p>That's my -- that's -- I'm happy to discuss more on those things with you during the break. But now, I'm inviting Oded talking about fund administrations.</p><p>ODED WEISS, MD OF MULTIFONDS, LUXEMBOURG, TEMENOS AG: Good to see you. Hello, everyone. Oded Weiss. I'm originally from Israel. I joined the Temenos family about 4 years ago when Temenos bought my company, Multifonds. And I'm going to tell you about the fund administration business.</p><p>So first, we're going to start just a little bit about the markets. What is fund administration? It's basically the back office of the asset managers. And most time, it's done by third-party administrators, banks. It's a large market, and we have a very unique value proposition across the asset classes, across jurisdictions. And that's basically what we do. If you think about the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, when you see the values of the mutual funds, we calculate those. The net asset values.</p><p>Let's talk about the landscape. So I'm going to try to use these laser. We have SS&amp;C, Simcorp, FIS, they're both SunGard, and Linedata. As you can see, we think very highly of them. And in terms of the things that makes us unique, it's really the global presence, the cross asset. But in the past few years, we invested a lot of time, but integrated workflow, automation, controls, making the system very straight through, transitioned the work of the back office from being -- pushing papers to actually using a tool that is very, very efficient. And we're the only one that are offering today integrated ETF. We think is a very important asset class. It's growing, and it's part of our solution.</p><p>Now when we think about the fund service markets, first, there is the asset managers. There are about 40,000s of them globally, almost $80 trillions in assets. These are the BlackRock, Allianz, Aberdeen, et cetera. And 75% of the back office is outsourcing. So think about $80 trillion asset under management, and about $60 trillion asset under administration.</p><p>And what is outsourced? So obviously, the market data, order management, this is not outsourced. This is in-house. The middle of this, fund accounting, transfer agency, a large part of it is outsourced. The banks, where you see there, like BNP, Citi, RBC, they provide those services. They charge basis points. There's about $33 billion revenue. Those third-party administrators were our target markets. We see them as aggregators, they grow, and they spend a lot of money on technology. Now, in terms of technology markets, so you have the area of the market data and order management, this is where the Bloombergs, Charles River, Thomson Reuters play. These are the data providers, the order management providers. Now if you think about the third-party administrator, they get the trade buyers after the trade is made. They just get the trade files. In the back office, obviously there's us and the other competitors that we mentioned. So this is how the market looks like. And as I said, we have always been focused on the third-party administrators.</p><p>In terms of our products, so we have 2 products. The first one is the accounting. The second one is a transfer agency. Accounting is net asset value calculation. Transfer agency is shareholder-keeping of the records of the actual holders. Now if you'll think about the accounting business, we've been around 35 jurisdictions. We cover ETF, and we have 10 sales and presales specialists focused on the accounting business. Transfer agency, across 20 jurisdictions globally, and 4 sales and presales specialists.</p><p>On the third-party administrator, this is where our strength. We have about 35 clients. We serve 7 of the top 10. And -- but we do have also a few asset managers, clients in North America, Asia and Europe.</p><p>Now it all goes well in that industry. The third-party administrators provide the service to the asset managers. But there are challenges. Regulation, pressure on fees and costs, need for greater risk and transparency. They're all well known.</p><p>The one concern in that industry that has been very difficult to tackle is how do you manage the relationship with your outsourcers. There have been many outages in the past 20 years. The most famous one mentioned here is the Bank of New York, using SunGard platform, miscalculate the funds for 1,200 funds. And for over a week, they could not provide value. You can imagine the market impacts of that. And the regulators constantly put tremendous pressure on the asset managers. You have to do something about it.</p><p>There's the famous -- their CEO letter went to all asset managers saying, we are concerned. But the problem was that you have an administrator, and to use 2 is quite expensive. As I remember, they charge -- basis points, they charge quite a lot of money. It's quite complicated. So there was not -- it wasn't really a solution for contingency. What happened if your administrator cannot provide the data? What happened if your administrator make mistakes? They do. And many times, they have to write checks to compensate the asset managers, but that's not a great solution.</p><p>So as some of you heard, we signed a very important partnership with Bloomberg earlier this year to basically address this problem, the problem of contingency and the oversight for the asset managers.</p><p>Let's talk about the product. We call it Navigator. And first, it's independent of the third-party administrator. They calculate it using data from different source. So it's -- create -- it provides real checks and balances versus the numbers they get from the administrator. Secondly, it's very easy to implement. You basically turn it on. If I think about the normal implementation of accounting system, it's always like, I used to be the -- in the Special Forces. You bring the technical people, the functional people, the project manager. And it's a big project. Here, it's on the Bloomberg terminal. It's there, it's available. If you want it on Monday, you have it.</p><p>Now in every partnership, each one of the partners needs to contribute something, right? So what Bloomberg is doing here, they provide the sales. They're selling the product. They have 900 asset managers client that's using the Bloomberg order management, AIM. They have 350,000 terminals and about 2,000 generally sales force. About 1/3 of them will be focusing on creating opportunities for us. And they have about 180 sales specialists in the asset management world. So you can imagine the impacts of that. They will provide customer support, and it's all delivered via the Bloomberg terminal.</p><p>We first provide, obviously, the product, the brains, the accounting engine. We train the sales force. This is happening right now in London and New York. We will provide presales support for very large opportunities, $500 billion and up, and we continue and maintain the product. And the target is those 40,000 asset managers. So this is quite an exciting opportunity for us and an amazing partnership with Bloomberg.</p><p>And in terms of the plan ahead, so last year, we spent time on the planning and design. Negotiated -- Max and I had a lot of fun -- negotiated the agreement with Bloomberg and get it all done. We are now finished the integration with the Bloomberg network. The sales force training is happening these weeks. Marketing material is done. And as of next week, we are starting proof of concept with multiple customers.</p><p>Second half of the year, full speed to market. And the last point that I will leave you with, you see here, it's a screenshot of a Bloomberg terminal. And here in the bottom, it basically said Powered by Temenos. So we didn't allow it to be white label. It was very important for us that a product is out there in the market, and we're going to change the industry.</p><p>Thank you very much. Andrew, Mr. Cloud, all yours.</p><p>ANDREW REEVES, HEAD OF TEMENOS CLOUD, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Oded.</p><p>Okay. So covering now the very -- the [sixth] growth area, which is the cloud and the SaaS offering. So my name is Andrew Reeves.</p><p>What we're talking about here is -- so you've heard a lot about cloud throughout all the presentations, around all the investments we've been doing in cloud, agnostic cloud, native technology, et cetera. And that all comes together here in the Temenos cloud and SaaS story that Temenos has. So this is where we enable our clients to utilize those capabilities of our products, to utilize our investment and to go and utilize cloud technology to help them achieve business outcomes, to help them drive their digital strategies, to help them be innovative in their marketplaces, to help them grow their businesses in new territories. Lots and lots of different use cases where cloud really resonates, and we're seeing that growth and success story.</p><p>If we look at our competitive landscape, it's something that's very rapidly changing. So we have our traditional competitors that we'd normally be facing in a traditional premise. And we now have other competitors coming through, so new start-type organizations who are entering the market, trying to compete. And also banks themselves who are playing Fintechs and then offering services out or Fintechs playing through all of a bank. So it's a very, very changing landscape.</p><p>But what's really key, again, as you can see here, is the way in which we're investing and the way in which we're enabling to optimize the use. So through open APIs, through the cloud native capabilities, et cetera.</p><p>Our regional presence is a really key differentiator for us. A lot of these small organizations don't yet have the footprint in all the different countries and territories that Temenos does, and we're seeing that as something that's very much valued by our clients and the market.</p><p>But what's really, really critical and what's the key differentiator is our history, is the breadth and depth of our experience in delivering cloud. And this isn't only you had the peripheral systems, this is we put a core banking with a first ISV to put a core banking system up on the public cloud back in 2011. So we have over 8 years of history in delivering cloud services.</p><p>And what we've seen over that time, and Max spoke about that really rapid acceleration recently, is the market is now starting to move. The market is now starting to make that shift towards cloud and the use of cloud technology that we've seen in other markets. And that's being driven by a number of factors. It's being driven largely by change in the regulatory landscape.</p><p>So we're seeing more and more regulators issuing guidance out to banks about how they can utilize -- it's an outsourcing service at the end of the day about how they can do that in a safe, secure way using cloud-type technology. And we've seen that change now on a country-by-country basis. But also here in Europe, we have the Financial Conduct Authority issuing specific guidance. That was then followed by the European Banking Authority, Luxembourg, Finmar. And Switzerland most recently has issued specific guidance to help banks make this transition. Over in APAC, we're seeing regulators using cloud to help drive competition in their markets. So we're starting to see neo banks entering. So volt, Judo Bank in Australia are great examples of banks who are entering the market to disrupt, to offer new services, to be more innovative, more able to meet the needs of a digital economy than some of the larger banks who are sort of encumbered by more legacy-type technology who can't react as quickly. So it's a very, very rapidly changing landscape.</p><p>What we're also seeing is changes in the way that banks are using the cloud. So very much it was a private cloud, banks who want to have control or more control of their cloud platform. We're starting to see that shift towards public cloud. We're starting to see banks realize that the billions of investment that the Azures, Microsoft set versus the Googles the Alibabas are putting into their cloud technology platforms, into the security of those, into the evolution of services that allow you to manage and operate those more effectively is, again, a key change in the market.</p><p>Now we know that some banks will still go down a private cloud route. And the different ways in which we can support that through our cloud-agnostic, cloud-native technology means that they can still optimize their use of private cloud just as much as public cloud. They can still elastically scale our software to meet different changing business needs. They can still provide an open ecosystem, allowing third parties to connect in and utilize services that they want to provide out. They can drive Fintechs. They can drive innovation through those types of offerings as well. So we're seeing that change happening.</p><p>We're seeing an ongoing growth. So 15% -- just over 15% growth in public cloud services. We're seeing more companies looking to utilize these types of offerings.</p><p>So if we then look at -- there's a lot of information on the slides, so I'll talk you through the main sort of key points.</p><p>So we look at our addressable market. You can sort of segregate it into these 4 quadrants. So by size of bank. And I think probably over 2, 3 years ago, it was the smaller banks that were looking to utilize cloud. It was the banks who didn't want -- tough to work at how to run the software themselves. They didn't want larger IT departments. They wanted to be able to focus on the business. They were often probably more nonregulated, smaller, community-type focused banks, et cetera. So a great use case for the services we offer, being able to outsource to us fully managed service. So we have engaged with a cloud platform provider. They don't have to go and form that relationship. We're running it as a managed service offering. We're keeping the software updated, maintained, monitoring it, running close to their business. But it's not a full BPO-type model, but we're looking after the software platform on behalf of our clients.</p><p>But we've then started to see larger banks looking to take that. And this is where the Temenos Continuous Deployment time offering really comes into play. So banks who maybe aren't yet ready to put their production systems on the cloud but want a more cost-effective way to be able to drive change, to be able to take the new releases of software from Temenos, to bring in their own developments and customizations around their own ecosystems and do that in a very seamless, rapid way; more multiple deployments, more releases more frequently, more incremental change into their environments to allow them to react to different market conditions, to launch new services. So we're seeing larger clients, ABN Amro being the case here, who have taken that offering.</p><p>Now again, we're offering choice. So they can take their offering from us. They can either create those cloud environments like the test environments using a cloud provider of their choice, bring their own subscription, or they can use the Temenos Cloud to do that as well. So again, if they don't want to have to go and engage with a cloud provider directly, they can utilize our relationship to be able to do that.</p><p>We then come across into the more exciting area, the innovative, the innovators, the people who are really driving changes in our market. I think this is really where we see a lot of movement and a lot of excitement. So again, the smaller organizations, the Judos, the volts entering the market, focusing on a very particular area, driving change, competing with the larger incumbents, and then through to larger ones, again more as open banks. So again, utilizing Temenos Cloud technology, in this case with the direct relationship with a cloud provider, but utilizing our technology to drive forward with changes in their particular markets. So really exciting spaces. Very, very rapidly evolving. But I think, as you've seen from the growth trajectory we're seeing, it's now something that's very much starting to change in the financial services industry, in our space.</p><p>We've talked about this briefly. So again, just to be clear on the different service offerings we can provide. So on the left hand here, extend and assemble, there's a box that goes around these, is that Temenos Continuous Deployment offering. So that ability to take the Temenos software, extend it to meet your specific needs, assemble then to gather your particular changes, customizations together with the items being delivered by Temenos and do that in a regression -- continuous regression-type way. You don't have to have your run on Temenos Cloud or even on cloud. Obviously, it optimizes your left-to-right journey if you do, but it's an offering that's there and available for people to use. And then, in the deliver space is where we're seeing a lot of changes.</p><p>So we're seeing a shift again from banks looking to have, again, sort of a more customized offering to banks looking for a much more prepackaged solution. So something where they can get that speed to market. There's something there that's geared for their industry, preconfigured with a model bank that helps them meet their specific regulatory requirements or interfaces to their specific ecosystem partners and also provides out-of-the-box functionality about the key products that they can then personalize to their particular market and then launch out into there in a very, very quick succession.</p><p>So that's where we think the future is going, is towards more of a public cloud than more of a standardized, packaged model but still with that ability to customize that digital front-end experience that the client wants to have with their customers.</p><p>So just to wrap up, I think Temenos really has -- and I think you've heard it in all of the different presentations today, not just mine. Temenos has a really unique position in the market. We have got 25 years of investment and experience in focusing purely on banking software, yes? A lot of these new entrants coming in are almost creating the new legacy. I think that the key differentiator Temenos has is that constant innovation. That constant R&amp;D is allowing us to keep on top of the market. It's allowing us to adapt to changes in technology and offer those services out. So that breadth of functionality, that ability to be cloud agnostic, cloud native, utilizing the specific capabilities where necessary but being able to port across between cloud providers as required, offload across multiple cloud providers in that active-active-type scenario places us in a very, very strong, unique position.</p><p>Okay. With that, that concludes the 6 key growth drivers. I'd now like to hand over to Alexa, our Chief Client Officer. Thank you.</p><p>ALEXA GUENOUN, CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER, TEMENOS AG: Thank you.</p><p>Good morning, everyone. I think we've heard a lot this morning, obviously, from Max and from all of my colleagues about the market and how we respond to that with our product. Obviously, all this needs to come together into delivering the value to our clients or implementing this at our clients.</p><p>I'm going to come back to this slide. You've seen it from Max. The idea behind is though, is not to be bragging or being arrogant, but we have done a lot of those. We have seen a lot and that we pause at some point this year in Turkey. It's about time that we wrap this up into a strategy that we think would work rather than adopt standard strategies from the market, which might not take into account how far we've come and what we have done already to deliver projects to our client.</p><p>With over 700 clients in core banking, obviously we've seen a lot of transformation. I say that to all the CIOs, CEOs we meet. I mean, they are lucky if they've done 1. If they've done 2 transformation, by then they're probably exhausted. They don't want to do another one. We've seen about 700. If you accelerate this with all the go-lives we've seen, we're going to reach somewhere around 1,500 by the end of this year for -- since 2011. So in 8 years. That's quite a lot of experience. Different size of banks: small, big. Different type of deployments, obviously leveraging our new technology. So that's something we can also bring.</p><p>Consultants and partners helping us implement. We have about 6,000 people in our ecosystem. That ranges from our own consultants, obviously. That's about 1,000 of that number. The rest is our vast ecosystem. They also see transformation. They also see how customers are using our solutions and bring back experience on how we can do things differently. All of them, obviously, belong to our wide network of partners, about 30 SI partners, or systems integrator, who bring also their own best practice, and we can combine that together.</p><p>So really, with that, we felt, okay, we see a lot. We have a lot of people coming to us and inquiring how do I transform with the bank. And they all have similar type of concerns.</p><p>It's difficult. They find it something quite complex. They all interested in. They all know they have to do something. But they all face similar size -- similar types of real problems.</p><p>The first thing is the market reality. You look at your bank and you say, okay, I need to transform. I need to be more modern. I need to be able to enter a new market. I need to be able to gain market share, whatever your goals may be or the bank goals may be. However, everybody here has heard about high-profile failures. And yes, it's one once in a while. But when you're a bank, that's already too much. So that's a question you have to ask yourself: Do I want to embark on this? Or do I just put a plaster or Band-Aid on my current system and let it run? Somebody else will take care of it.</p><p>Outages. We've heard those as well. A bank goes down. It's in the market. There's usually news being relayed on this and concerns. So again, do I really want to go there? The C-level tenure overall doesn't encourage you to do this. You -- if you have a CEO in a bank, a CIO, a CTO, very often the appetite for taking -- embarking on something that is seen as risky might be slightly less than what we would think. And again, the plaster solution comes in, which might be easier.</p><p>Short-term thinking. Obviously, they have a problem now. They want to fix it now. When you think core banking transformation and bank transformation, you have a longer horizon. Not everybody is able to do that.</p><p>To this, you add the -- what they hear or what they perceive as the problem of those transformation: the cost. Again, lots of reports everywhere. And you here in the room, some of you produce those reports saying how much it costs and how expensive it's been, how disruptive to the organization of a bank it has been.</p><p>So -- and then those progressive implementation that seemed to go on for a long time. You hear that they have done a little bit and then a little bit and another bit.</p><p>So unless we're able to bring to them time to value, it's very difficult for them. So what they're really coming to us with is, okay, very interested. We need to do something. We're coming at the end of the cycle of our system that was built in the '60s or assembled in the '70s with other systems, but how can we make it that we have a better time to value, obviously? How can you, Temenos, help us build the business case that's going to stand on its 2 feet? Because if not, the chances of going to our board and asking for several tens of million or several hundreds of million, in some cases, is not going to fly. And then lastly, we can't introduce risk.</p><p>So putting all of these parameters together, we said, okay, as we've just seen, we've done a lot. We've introduced a lot of new products. We've introduced a lot of new technology. How do we leverage this?</p><p>We have tried to calculate this. We've tried to figure out what it could mean. And this is basically by taking all the technology and all the products we've introduced to the market recently and all the clients' experience.</p><p>So if we try to combine best-in-class of all our client. They have to be a combination of several clients' results if you look at it, on all the leverage they can have, on the various aspects of their transformation journey, you can see that you can dramatically reduce the overall implementation time.</p><p>Obviously, implementation time means cost. So if you look at things, usually there are some areas where it's difficult to interact. The ongoing operational cost if you don't do anything is difficult to move. But now with the introduction of cloud and the fact that your infrastructure can go as much as 10x down from what Alex said this morning, there's a leverage. There's something you can do to reduce that pillar.</p><p>Change program. Again, you might not always be able to change a lot, but it's a once journey. So fine, you don't move it too much. It's okay.</p><p>Comes the next one, which is the software. Obviously, the more package, the better it is. But again, there is a onetime cost. Or with the new methods and the new services, you can transform that into OpEx if you want to. Now you're able to do that.</p><p>Then you come to the really -- the 2 parts where we think we can introduce significant improvement to the timelines and then to the cost of transformation.</p><p>The first one is configuration and employment. We talked a lot -- I mean, Alex talked about it and many of us in the room talked about this constant innovation and this DevOps concept. Everybody talks DevOps. It's been going on for, we have to say, about 2 years, and we see 2 to 5. We see a lot of different version of it. And it all -- it is all around automation. But what we offer is more than automation. What we offer is really, of course, automation but continuous improvement, continuous renovation, continuous change of your bank. And that brings in itself this box, which is quite costly, of configuration and deployment much more down. Why? Because you bring value constantly. So you don't have a pause with massive investment, nothing happens and then you see that coming through your books. We constantly introduce changes, constantly are able to show to the stakeholders how this can impact their system.</p><p>Finally, the integration we talked a lot. Again, this is very technology-driven. APIs. Obviously, point-to-point solution are difficult to integrate. API will extract you from that complexity. We're using that. Having standard offering, packaged offering. So when -- so the more packaged, the more experience.</p><p>Again, we sell banking. We talked a lot about technology today. But don't forget, contrary to a lot of the people in that space, the new entrants mostly, it cannot only be about technology. It has to be also about what you bring into banking, and that's the maturity. So that's one of the leverage, obviously, we use.</p><p>The architecture, we talked about it. A lot of the new technologies can only be used if you have the right architecture, and we have been constantly reviewing architecture, constantly reviewing our product. And we don't -- the shift might sound trivial. And again, I think Alex mentioned that. We've been running on the cloud for a long time. But running on the cloud is one thing. Leveraging the cloud is something else. And for this, you need to be really native. And this is what we're constantly doing, making sure we leverage.</p><p>Continuous deployment, I'm not going to come again on this one, but it's a key pillar of how you accelerate. If you're able to constantly bring new features, new functions, reducing the cycle of testing for a bank, making sure that when you build a product, you can very, very quickly, ideally -- I mean, this is the dream of everybody: You code it in the morning, you deploy it in the afternoon. We know it's a bank. We know it's never going to be like that. But between 6 months and 2 weeks to really seeing a product, there is a massive saving there.</p><p>And then the last point is what I'm going to focus a little bit more on, is the implementation strategy because something needs to glue all this together. Technology, obviously, maturity and proven product, deployment, how do you make this all as one seamless implementation?</p><p>And there's been a lot of things in the market. All of our clients have gone through various journeys. We've heard a lot about big banks' implementation. You in the room, as you know, it's like I repack everything, and I transfer everything to the new system. That works when you have a smaller bank or when you have a very simple business because the risk is usually less. The business line is not much, so it's quite easy to do that. But it doesn't fit to a bigger bank, it doesn't fit to more complex organizations. So we have observed that shift. And we are seeing that this is still working but, again, not for all the banks.</p><p>From that extreme, we move to okay, this is too difficult. We can't do everything in one go, let's do bit by bit. And that's where the problem started. Because how small a bit you can do, that's the problem. And we've come from people saying, okay, let's do a certain type of account first and then another type of account. That way, you'll never get rid of your legacy. You will still need to maintain legacy somewhere. You'll still need to integrate somewhere. And that's probably -- again, it's -- like everything, it's a pendulum. We can't do everything in one go. Let's do the minimum thing and add them up. And depending on what's swinging, thinking this is also not viable, very, very long journey. Of course, less risky certainly because you're doing small bits. But how do you make it, first of all, in a shorter time? Because if you start adding bits, it's going to take you a long time to get to the end of your journey. And also, how do you make sure that you continue innovating?</p><p>So in between happen and I think driven a lot by the -- we'll talk about that with Leumi later -- driven a lot by the new entrants who had the luxury to say, I'm going to build something on the side and I'm not going to look at my legacy technology. I'm going to absorb myself on technology either because I don't have it, I'm a new entrant, so that's very simple, or because within my bank, I'm going to create something completely new, and I will not be bothered with what's around me. And that gave us some idea because we said, okay, that seems to be the fastest way to do it. So if you're able to stand a new bank within a big organization -- so you still have to catch up with the complexity of the organization but only for what is vital, let's put it this way. If you're able to do that with a new entrant, why not doing it with an existing bank? Why not isolating parts of the business that you can isolate and run while the rest is on your legacy rather than hallowing the core, putting little bits and pieces? And this is when we said, okay, that's probably the best option. And this is how we came up with the build and renovate option.</p><p>So from this new concept that we saw with new entrants, where they build and migrate later potentially, to the progressive renovation, which we felt has a value when you say doing front and back separately but probably becomes a bit more complicated when you say cut the back in multiple pieces, we felt that this was probably the best combination. And we've put that in play with some of our customers who are doing this, and it's actually dramatically changing the way they're implementing. Again, it's only possible because of the technology we now have available.</p><p>We're not doing this on our own, obviously. I mean we're not a services company. And this is the person who's running services, who's telling you this. I don't have a problem with it, we are a product company. What we want is that what we deliver to the client, the product, we make sure is implemented the best way possible, follows our best practices.</p><p>Whatever goes around it or the other pillars you saw, the integration, the change, all of that, we don't need to do. We don't bring much value add for that, to be honest. We do not have also the pyramids of skill that you would require, so our price would not be efficient anyway. So we're very clear on what we do in terms of services.</p><p>Services to us is delivering our product to the best of its efficiency in the best way. The rest, all these people do it for us. We have them, obviously. They're not going to learn our software by magic. So again, the more you add, the more you change your solution, the more education became vital.</p><p>So we've moved away from the good, old way of classroom training, having people into rooms, again leveraging technology even in that space. We now have a full offer that is cloud-based, that is a membership offering with a portal where our client, our partners and our own staff are able to get trained, to get certified. So we know, by the way, that we have a certain level of understanding and knowledge across our ecosystem and it's of quality. So there's different level. We still do classroom, obviously, in some cases, especially for projects, project readiness. When you start a new project, the reason you need to put everybody in a room and align on the strategy.</p><p>Continuous learning. So it's not only continuous integration. We also do continuous learning for the TLC online community. And then, the TLC engine, which helps for the entire transformation journey, more around processes and procedures and making sure that, that follows you along the way of your implementation, and then becomes, for the bank, the repository of where they will hold the new bank, pretty much.</p><p>So that's where we are today with the implementation. Very different from what we used to do. And again as I said, we've seen a lot of example and I think a good one is what we have done with Leumi.</p><p>We have Ilan Buganim here who's the first Executive Vice President at Leumi and manages data, but also more importantly, is the father of Pepper. So I think he will take you through that journey of a new digital bank.</p><p>ILAN BUGANIM, FIRST EXECUTIVE VP, HEAD OF CTO, CDO &amp; INFRASTRUCTURES AND HEAD OF DATA DIVISION, BANK LEUMI LE- ISRAEL B.M.: So I have the hard work to speak just before lunch. So I'll try to do it properly. I am Ilan Buganim, Head of Data Division in Bank Leumi, actually in charge of -- I am the Chairman of Pepper that is the most important story here and I'll speak about. And I speak overall the story and definitely Temenos is very important part of the story, but I'll give the entire story of who is Pepper? Why we created it? And where we are heading.</p><p>So before maybe speaking about ourselves and about Pepper, I think that it is extremely important to understand the overall macro situation and why we even started this journey. Because speaking about Pepper, you must understand that we are -- Bank Leumi is actually one of the 2 biggest -- or largest banks in Israel. So we are the incumbent. Why an incumbent bank needs at all to create a challenger bank that actually challenge -- the incumbent challenge Leumi?</p><p>So it's extremely and very unusual decision that we have made. And in order to understand it, we need to understand what happens in the last few decades? So when speaking about what happens, I put it in a certain way you can put it in different ways, but we see that there is one large road with many curves. And what happens is that in every junction, every turn of this road, there are people that are very innovative and were able to envision what happening and there are many companies that weren't visionary enough to take the turn and actually left out of the road.</p><p>So I believe every story start with these 2 guys from Google that actually changed the world to me because they made an order with our information. We had the Internet before them, but they made the first order that enables all the things that followed them to happen. And many things happened, I'll focus only on a few things that are important to our story. We see here one of the huge stories of Amazon and Netflix, and that point of time, around 2,000-plus, what happens is that we were introduced, 2 of them, with the long tail concept.</p><p>That challenge what was obvious, companies like Tower Records and Blockbuster and guess what happens? With the new concept that they introduced, since then, we're speaking about Netflix moment, one moment, one Netflix moment that immediately after a few companies, which were very strong, do not exist anymore. And they cannot do -- cannot fix whatever they made wrong in order to get back to the competition. It's very violent.</p><p>And when looking further, we see that it's happening again and again. Here, it's Mark Zuckerberg and the revolution that they've made. I stopped one moment on this area that is known to all of us. If we're looking back then to 2007, Nokia was definitely one of the biggest companies. 60%, if I remember well, from the stock market in Finland. And they controlled all the mobile world. And if you remember well, probably as I see most of us have been in the same age back then, so they tried to make the mobile as smaller as possible.</p><p>And suddenly came Steve Jobs and said, no, we want to make the mobile bigger. They said, he's crazy. And this dealing only with 5% of the mobile world, which is a smartphone, back then less than 5%. Let them fail. What happens is they very fastly understood that it's threatening them. That they are going to be impacted severely because of it. And then, they tried to change very slow, always late. If you remember they made many changes. For example, they decided to create their own operating system. But back then, there were 2 operating systems: one for iOS, one for Android, each one with 600,000 applications.</p><p>They needed to go to 600,000 developers to convince them to develop also for Nokia. Definitely, they didn't understand the market, and the market was violent to them. They purchased, afterward, Microsoft the operating system, and in the end, they decided to go to the operating system of Google, but everything was too late and they lost their market. They lost their market because they didn't see what happens and they didn't do the right activities on time. And I can speak about each one of these junction, really it's an hour that we can speak about it, but I want to go fast then to speak about our story.</p><p>When looking over the revolutions, you see that the banking area is the last one to come. The revolution was all over it, but banking were a bit out of it. And their change is slow. Most of the incumbent bank changes slow, changing a bit their system. They don't understand that the reason we track to their business.</p><p>You know that -- and today we see more and more challenger banks like Monzo, Pepper, N26. And they are saying, yes, but they are targeting only a small portion of our customers. We are strong. We are better. We will do very well. And we are saying, you know what? I'm saying to the incumbent banks that these challenger banks are actually targeting their root.</p><p>The millennials that are actually coming to these bank, and we will speak about them, are moving. And they will be the new customers of the new banks. The leafs of the new tree will come from these roots and guess what? They will have a big problem. So we knew it and we saw it in Leumi 4 years ago. And we said, you know what, we want to make our own challenger bank. Even as an insurance to our business.</p><p>And let's see what we have done and what are the results. So we said to ourselves, first of all, we want to build a bank that people love, because you know, people do not like banking. They do not like banks, definitely. Especially, after 2008.</p><p>And let's face it, banking is painful. And why it's painful? Before saying why it's painful, so just to see these pictures. The 71% of the millennials would rather visit dentist than listen to their banks or go to the branches. By the way, I see a survey -- I saw a survey in America that said, that the only things that people hate more than going to the branch is going to the dentist, going to cemetery and assess their houses. So -- and then we will come in.</p><p>And why it's painful? So think about it, with all the investment of the big banks in technology, still we have lots of branches, lots of bank -- of bankers in these branches, ridiculous fees that you need to pay, just to manage your current account because there are lots of people behind it, thousands of people behind every current account. And more important, most of the customer are totally confused by the banking products. They do not understand it. They are totally confused. It's amazing how they are confused, especially when you're dealing with millennials.</p><p>So we wanted to do something that is totally different, dramatically different from what exists today. And in order to do that we knew that we cannot just take something and change it a bit. We need to do probably almost everything from scratch different. And speaking about Temenos, I can tell you that we sort of -- we actually observed and saw what happens in the market and we said you know what? We have a core system, Leumi Core System, 40 years of investment into it. Maybe we'll take that. And we'll just put a nice layer on top.</p><p>And maybe we will confuse our customers. They will see a nice application and we'll think that it's a new bank and maybe we'll acquire them. But we understood and we saw that it's not working even in places, I don't want to say the names because -- not to insult other banks, but few banks did it and failed.</p><p>We decided and understood that we want to do something totally different because we want to achieve totally different targets. And by the way, when speaking about what is the biggest advantage of this challenger, more techie banks? And I'll speak about many challenges -- many advantages. But one biggest advantage is their ability to move fast because the market is always changing. Only if you can run and if somebody -- because we're doing wonderful things in Israel. I can tell you that all the big banks try to imitate and copy what we are doing. But it takes them years to copy what we are doing in 2 months. So we are trying to do more in this time with less budget, with more innovative people, and this is the competition. We know that everybody will try to copy. Also, with old system, you can do nice things, but it costs you fortune and it takes you time.</p><p>So speaking one word about America before we are getting into maybe what's special in Pepper, we did nice thing in Israel and we'll speak about it. We are checking also our ability to go to America with that, because we believe that in America it's the right time to come with innovative products. So we went there and we checked what happens and we saw that everything is ready for this challenger approach, the new bankings, the real-time banking, and the people understand it. If you're asking millennials, they don't understand the banking there. Definitely, they are not loyal. They do not have a problem to get banking from Amazon, Google and Apple. They grew up on these companies that gave them a wonderful experience.</p><p>So now you cannot confuse them by saying that the incumbent banks will -- are better experience for them with their branches, in the places that they need to go with their signature, they do not have signature at all and to sign on documents that they don't understand. We know that is a big opportunity. And with what we have done, we think that it fits perfectly to there also.</p><p>So what is Pepper? So speaking about Pepper, first of all, it's a mobile bank. Looks obvious today. Not obvious, at all when we're looking 4 years backwards when we started. And most of the people did their banking activities in websites and in the branches. We decided that the future is mobile. This also enables you to be much faster because you have one channel, it's much easier to adopt it and to move very fast with them.</p><p>So it's a cheap digital-only bank, incubated in Bank Leumi. And when we say incubated in Bank Leumi, we needed to do, also in the bank, something totally different. We created a separate tech entity inside the bank to be able to carry these burden, separate from Bank Leumi and I'll speak out these 2 journeys are also aligned in the future. But we needed to do something also with the culture, with the people, with innovative people. We needed to create everything from the beginning.</p><p>So we launched in 2017, and we have, since then, the highest market share of new banks' accounts, which is not obvious at all. We, the new bank in Israel, recruit more accounts, more new accounts, than any other big bank in Israel. And it's growing and growing comparing to them. I can tell you that we introduced few products, I'm not sure if it's good to say or bad to say, but we have a waiting list even now of around 4,000 accounts that wants to open. And the waiting list is because everything is digital in the process, but the regulation force us to do a small video chat. This small video chat creates a huge line of waiting list because we're adding -- trying to do our best, we are 24x6. Most of the people are doing it in the middle of the night, but still there are many joiners.</p><p>And of course that we are ranked as part of the top mobile banks worldwide.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ILAN BUGANIM: So let's speak about few elements that we saw in this short movie. When speaking about Pepper, it's not like -- when we're speaking about growing banks, like Marcus in America, they are focusing only on debits -- on deposits or any other single product.</p><p>So Pepper is an entire bank with everything that is needed in order to create a very good engagement between this bank and the customer. And in order to do that, you need lots of banking products. You need checking account, deposit, loans, credit card, check, saving, P2P payments, investment. We have 3 application -- applications, as you see -- as you saw. One is for moving money between peer to peer; one is the banking itself; and one is investment application that we are launching only this month.</p><p>So what are the things that we emphasize on Pepper? First of all, as I said, it's all mobile bank. Everything is in the mobile. Now think about it, we have 5 senses. If you would like to use only one sense, you really need to excel in this sense. And that's what happens in Pepper. We don't have any other channel or any big channel. So we need to excel in this channel that's called mobile. It shouldn't be just an application on a mobile, it needs to be extremely good application when we're not trying to compare ourselves to the other banks, but we are trying to compare ourself to the big tech guys like Apple, Google, Amazon, these are the big -- Facebook, of course. These are the people or the companies that we are trying to learn form.</p><p>So banking-wise, we are saying there are no fees for current account, ever. Of course, that is cannibalization of the old bank, but think about it, we are doing the same banking without the so many troops that are needed in order to make the banking. So there is a reason why we cannot -- we can afford this kind of banking.</p><p>And an all new technology. Why an all new technology? Because as I said, we want to be a real-time banking. We want to do banking in a totally different way. When you take a loan in Pepper, you get it in a few seconds. You take a deposit, you get it in 2 seconds. You swipe your card somewhere, you'll send your application immediately that you swiped your card, how much, where, and how much it cost you. You're going to an ATM, it will tell you how much money you withdraw, what is the fee that you go -- that you paid in this ATM, no matter where is it in the world.</p><p>So actually, in order to do that, you understand that you cannot use the old technology that the bank says. And because of that we have this, to me, one of the biggest decisions is where -- what is the right core in order to create this banking. And I was, back then -- I back then led this process of choosing the right core banking that will fit this journey. And I can tell you that there were not too many hesitation for me to choose Temenos because I came from -- by the way, before Leumi, I was in Amdocs 15 years. I know the tech the world very well. I were -- I was almost everywhere in the world, selling to companies, working in the technology. I understood what is the main difference between a product and a solution.</p><p>We're the solution. We have a very good solution to core system in Leumi. Forty years of investment. But think about it, it's insane what the banks are doing. They're investing lots of money into a software of a product, that has only one customer, only single customer. How can they excel when they have only one single customer? So we understood that we don't want it, we want to choose something else.</p><p>And I wanted the product, why a product? Because I wanted that when I'm running and trying to recruit more and more people to my bank, I want that someone will think about when we develop more feature and will go forward even faster than myself. And this is the sense of choosing a product. And by the way, there are many solutions in the market. Many companies that provide core system, not all of them behave like products. And I don't want to speak about them, but that was one of the focus that it was interesting to me when we chose, in the end, Temenos.</p><p>And I can say, looking 4 years backward, that we didn't choose a provider, we chose a partner that went with us into this journey. Here, what I've heard, what are our problems? And I was happy to see that we start in -- Release 15, now we are introduce Release 18. And I was happy to see that many of the things that we need, in order to continue and compete and to be #1 in what we are doing. So many features, many functionalities are introduced in these versions.</p><p>From data needs, real-time in extracting of data to our data legs and loan origination new process and so on and so forth, there are lots of things that have happened there, a continuous upgrade, and so on and so forth. So we were happy to see that 3 years after we started, because in the beginning, when you started, you don't know that you have made the right choice, that it's going on the right direction with us. And we needed even further because we intend to do, in America, a cloud-based solution and it's important for us to go also to this direction.</p><p>And of course, that it's not only the -- the only technology that we have chosen. We couldn't go to public cloud back then, but we have done a private cloud with VMware and every single technology that we've chosen back then was with lots of thought.</p><p>The next thing that we have done is a bank that is totally personal. And I can tell you one thing, if you open -- if 3 people has an incumbent bank and application, a banking application, they will open it up. They will see exactly the same application, but with different numbers. Your numbers, so it's personalized because I view in my current account, X amount and someone else's Y amount. When few people will open Pepper, they will see a totally different application because it's personalized. It's free like Facebook or Google -- Facebook or Instagram. And this feed is totally adapted to you. It's got your content that you're interested in. We have checking. We have a Big Data to check in or whether you're reading these articles or not in order to be more focused about your needs. The statistic that you get are according to your activities, the suggestion and the promotions that you have are according to your behavior. Even proposal like movies and other benefits that we are giving to you will be according to your behavior.</p><p>And of course, that it's not -- we are not where we want to be, and we are trying to refine ourselves all the time, but personalization and simple and smart user experience is one of the main focus.</p><p>By the way, also our language is very adaptive to people that do not understand banking. It's very simple, understood, clear without small lines, without hidden lines. Everything is focused to be very simple.</p><p>And just recently, I think the regulator changed for us a few regulations that enable us to open a new bank account also from -- for youngs, from -- that are 16-years-old and on. Beforehand, everybody that want to open a new account in a digital bank, need to go to open in incumbent bank, and just the second account needed to be in the digital bank because they needed the face-to-face with a banker in the branch. And it's changed. And since then -- since that change -- by the way, on the same day that the regulators changed the regulation, we launched the product, same-day. It's [never] happened in Israel at least. And since then, that day, as I said, there is a boost in new accounts of youngers that are coming to us because the products are very adapted to them.</p><p>We were focused that if someone is 16-years-old, he will not need his parents in order to register to the bank. It's his own decision. We will explain him exactly what he's doing. He doesn't need approval, guarantees or whatever. The structure of the account adapted to youngs and according to the reg -- its debit cards. They cannot go into overdraft. We explain them exactly what they are doing.</p><p>Why? Because we want them to have a very nice experience from the beginning. You saw banking. People are not loving it too much. So when they have a very good experience, in the end, these young guys that do not have much money today. Tomorrow will be the primary accounts in the banking. And we are focused in long-term engagement, and not a very short engagement or a product engagement. And this is maybe the differentiation between Pepper to other banks.</p><p>Speaking about how it looks like. So as I said, 3 applications, the banking application pay, which is peer-to-peer payment and investment that is beautiful applications we're launching just now. We have our own front-end service layer that connect the front end to the back end. Big Data infrastructure and technology that is based on Temenos core banking, VMware and Big Data infrastructure. And of course, that we brought over the knowledge that we have from Bank Leumi, in order to do the banking also in Pepper, and to challenge it, of course.</p><p>Speaking forward a bit about what we intend to do. So we saw that we created a very nice bank in Pepper with a new core. And we see that in Bank Leumi, we have a problem with our core. The question is, how much time you can continue with such huge investment every year for one single customer, Bank Leumi? So Bank Leumi is developing these old core and cannot move very fast because it costs a fortune, only for one customer, Bank Leumi.</p><p>So we understood that we need to do something a bit different and to use the asset of Pepper, is working, yes, less customers than Bank Leumi, so definitely its opportunity. So we are taking now the core, and we intend to enhance it, with the features and needs of Bank Leumi in order that in 2, 3 years' time, Bank Leumi will also be connected to this new core and actually we'll remove all the old core with all the old technology that align and that we are using today.</p><p>So this is an amazing journey that we started just now. This year we started or last year we started the program, and it's extremely important for, I would say, for the future of Bank Leumi.</p><p>That's all I have to say about Pepper. So thank you very much, and enjoy your lunch.

We're very pleased delivering excellent set of results yesterday evening, and we've got a great agenda and lineup of speakers for you today. We're going to be running through a number of different sessions covering strategy. We're going to do a deep dive across a number of our products. You're going to see some great demonstrations of the client user cases of the product as well.</p><p>We'll also be covering our U.S. opportunity. Takis, our CFO, will be digging into how we plan to drive growth going forward and deliver value for our shareholders. And we'll also be talking about how we operate responsibly as a company. So with no further ado, I'd like to hand over to Max Chuard, our CEO.</p><p>MAX CHUARD, CEO &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Adam. Good morning, and thank you for taking the time to be with us today. It's going to be quite a full day, even though we met not too long ago. In fact, we had our last Capital Market Day, it was in May of last year. I'm pleased to say that a lot has happened during that period of time. A lot has happened on the product side, on the innovation side. A lot has happened from our geographies, the development we've been able to make in the U.S. and in other countries. A lot has happened on our deployment of our SaaS offering, and we are going to discuss that in more details.</p><p>As you know, last night, we reported our Q4 and full year results, and it was my first year as the CEO of Temenos, so I'm pleased that we had an excellent 2019 across all our KPIs. You can see that the total software licensing grew again at 23%. The last 5 years, we were able to consistently and sustainably grow at 25% over that period of time. We continue to grow on a profitable basis, extending our margins and EPS that grew at 19% over that period of time.</p><p>And you can see a very exciting new development, which is our SaaS and cloud business, which is really taking off in a massive way. So an extraordinary performance on our SaaS and cloud business, which grew over 50% on a compound base over the last 5 [years], but in Q4, grew at around 1.5x faster than last year. So extremely pleased with those results.</p><p>However, today, we are here to talk about the medium term and the long term as well because we operate in a market which is so large. It's a $60 billion market. And the driver for growth and the driver for change are so required for banks to transform. And I think we -- most of you works in banks, you understand the fact that banks are still, by far, using legacy technology, technology which is not shaped for the digital age and that it needs to change. And hence, not only it is a very large market but it is also a growing market, the market which is growing at 8%.</p><p>Clearly, we've been growing faster than that because we've been gaining market share. We are already the established leader in that market. So today, we are the world's #1 banking software provider, with more than 3,000 banking customers. Any type of size, large banks, the most sophisticated banks, the digital banks, but as well smaller banks, regional banks.</p><p>That leadership give us so much credibility. We've got so many references. In 2019, every day, a bank was going live on our software. So that's huge. And this is why we've got the confidence to be able to foresee that we will continue to sustainably grow by at least 15% in the long term. We've been delivering that -- above that, obviously, the last 5 years on an organic basis. I'm talking organic. Here, you can see that the last 5 years, we grew at 25%. So we've been able to very nicely complement our organic growth with very strategic acquisitions that have been fully integrated within our offering and that have been able to accelerate our growth. And that's clearly -- the goal is to continue to bring additional growth through M&amp;A as well.</p><p>And finally, and which personally give me even more confidence on our sustainability of our total software licensing for the future, is the acceleration that we are seeing on our SaaS and cloud business, which clearly was not there a few years ago, and we are going to see how this is transforming our business. So excessively exciting.</p><p>We all know that banking is under massive challenges. It's undergoing a fundamental change. We see new competitors, which are becoming more prominent. And already, we see new entrants that are trying to capture the customer relationship, and that they want to be able to gain access to the customer and to distribute banking services. At the same time, the customers are more sophisticated. The millennials are tech-savvy. What they want is high personalized experience, the same as they enjoy with Amazon or with Uber.</p><p>And also, you've got the regulators, regulator that is encouraging innovation and competition, just if we talk about open banking and how we see the banking value chain being -- breaking up between the manufacturing part of the banking and the distribution part of the banking. You got new technology like AI, explainable AI, cloud, API that is driving change. This is exciting change, which new entrants are able to capitalize on it, and the incumbent vendors are clearly at a disadvantage compared to them.</p><p>So to win in the new era of banking, banks need to transform. Banks need to change, and banks need to embrace technology to create new business models. We never had so much technology, and this is great. It -- technology enables that transformation. Look at what we can achieve with SaaS and cloud, the agility it brings, the scalability it brings. You can scale up and down automatically at a very more affordable cost than when you were doing traditionally on your own application. APIs opens up a whole market. You connect with the ecosystem. You can become as a bank, a marketplace provider of both financial and nonfinancial services.</p><p>Micro-services allows for a continuous innovation. You can renovate the bank a step at a time. You choose when you want to start and when you want to finish. All of that was not possible the last few years, technology enabled that change. AI, explainable AI on efficiencies, on being able to offer hyper-personalized experiences. And obviously, underlying all of that, you need security. And the more data analytics you get, the better your models.</p><p>So as I said, the banking model are changing, and we see more and more the traditional banks that choose to offer and to manufacture product, that those products were then going to be distributed to their customers to break up. And we see more and more a concentration on the manufacturing side, where we see consolidation. And we see lots of new entrants on the distribution side that do want to be able to distribute new products, that do want to be able to offer personalized customer experiences. And that, ultimately, becomes marketplaces that will distribute both financials and nonfinancial products to the customers.</p><p>And Temenos has the technology and the product to -- for that requirement. We've got the de facto offering for both the manufacturing and the distribution. All our products are cloud-native, cloud-agnostic, multi-cloud. With Temenos Infinity, we address the distribution side. It is the most advanced solution that exists in the market. I have to say in fact, pleasantly excited of what we've been able to achieve in 2019 with the acquisition of Avoka, with the acquisition of Kony, and we'll discuss that in a moment.</p><p>And then obviously on the manufacturing side, we've got Transact. And both can be sold on a standalone basis or tightly integrated through APIs. We believe banks have everything they need to succeed. They've got the capital. They're regulated. They've got extremely good insights on the customer data, and they still enjoy the trust of the customer. But there is no question that we need to transform. It is our belief that it is through an end-to-end transformation that banks would get the most of the benefits. So back to front, front to back. And we've got the technology. We've got the ability to do that.</p><p>And this is why I remember a year ago, we decided to launch Infinity and Transact to give the freedom to the banks to innovate the way they wanted. And what is great is we've been able to prove the benefit of that. And we run what we call value benchmark with customers, which is -- and Kanika will discuss this in more details later on, which is detailed financial analysis of our customers and prospects as well. And we've been able to prove that our customers are much more profitable than the rest of the industry. We've been able to prove that they can enjoy half of the cost-to-income ratio, which is amazing.</p><p>Our top-performing quarters enjoyed 27% cost-to-income ratio. I mean, that's a dream for most of the banks when you see that on average, banks have a cost-to-income ratio at more than 50%. And this, you can achieve with modern technology from Temenos through an end-to-end transformation. They obviously enjoy higher return on equity but most importantly, they can invest so much more innovation, where today, traditional banks do spend a lot on IT. We know that they spend a lot, but the spending goes on the support, on the maintaining -- of the maintenance of the legacy systems.</p><p>We have what we call the winning combination, and we are very proud of that. Very proud because for the last 25 years, we've been extremely focused on. And how we differentiate ourselves and how we lead the market today is because we lead both with detailed deep function -- banking functionality, full understanding of the banking market, the -- and [large now], the deep knowledge that we have is amazing. But in addition to the knowledge of the banking market, we get that to the country level, to the regulation in each of the country that we package. So this is one of the strengths, and we couple that with advanced technology. Technology which is native, which is open, which is agnostic, which is APIs first. And that combination, nobody has it.</p><p>We do see some vendors that have one of them but not the other. And let's discuss that in a moment. So today, we outsell the competition by a factor of 5. So on average, we sell 5 more deals than our competitors. And in fact, that leadership is accelerating. We see what we call the old legacy. Those are the traditional vendor that we've been competing for the last 15 years. We know them extremely well. We've been beating them for the last 15 years and we will continue to do that. Those are vendors that have an old technology, which is not fit for the digital age. They are not focused as well in one specific industry, so they usually cover all type of industries so you can question the dedication to banking, as Temenos does. And clearly, the technology is not fit for the cloud. It's not fit for AI, not fit for the innovation of DevOps. So that's one set of competitors. And as I said, we know them quite well.</p><p>Now we've seen some new competitors that entered the last few years. We call them the new legacy, and I'll tell you why in a second. Those are digital-only. So they are cloud vendors that have a very limited scope of functionality. It's mainly a technology toolkit, if you want, which has not been productized, that cannot offer end-to-end renovation, that don't have AI analytics capabilities. And most importantly, as I said, they are not able to productize, they are not able to continuously innovate the product. And hence, they will become the new legacy.</p><p>We have a unique value proposition. And as you know, for the last 25 years, we've been extremely consistent with that. First, we believe that we do one thing well, and this is banking. So we've been focused 100% in that. And when you go to a bank and you say, \"Listen, your success is my success. There is no way out for me. We are your true partners.\" This is extremely powerful.</p><p>So today, focused only on banks. We've got more than 3,000 banks, as I said, to the largest one, to the most sophisticated banks, to the digital-only banks and to the smaller banks as well. So any banks anywhere of any size. I already discussed our winning proposition, of functionality and advanced technology. We are open, independent, as I said. You can implement our core system on the back of any front system or you can implement our Infinity or front office with any back office system. So totally independent, open through our developed platform.</p><p>Relentless focus on innovation. We are passionate about innovation, and you'll hear my leadership team later on talk about product innovation and how passionate, how we are proud to be able to come -- to be the first to innovate. We were the first to go to the cloud 10 years ago. Ten years ago, we were the first to put a bank on the -- a core system on the cloud. And we continuously do that because we invest massively in the product.</p><p>And finally, we've got a very large community of more than 6,000 people, 6,500 people of consultants that we can leverage to be able to ensure we deliver success to our customers. As I said, in 2019 alone, every working day, a bank was going live on our software.</p><p>We have a very large market. We said that it's a $60 billion market. Now 80% of that spending, though, is still done in-house. Still the majority, and this is probably the last industry that has not fully embraced packaged software. So still the majority, 80% is spent in-house on legacy systems, a patchworks of different systems that has accumulated over the last 40 to 50 years, well before the age -- or the Internet age. Clearly, those are not fit for business anymore. They are struggling to automate. They are struggling to get efficiencies out. They are struggling to bring customer experiences, and there is a need to change.</p><p>We've got 4 main products to address that market: digital front office, which is our Infinity product; Transact, which is our core banking product; payment; and fund administration. And all of those segments of the market are growing. On average, this is a market growing at 8%, and we believe we can be growing faster than that because of our value prop.</p><p>Now this very large market, how do we go about capturing that opportunity? And last year, we discussed which were our strategic initiative because, as you know, Temenos is all about growth. It's all about capturing that opportunity. And hence, our strategy has been put together to ensure we can maximize on that opportunity. It starts with the product, obviously. It starts with ensuring that we continue to have the best solution out there. As you know, we spent twice as much as any of our competitor on R&amp;D. We spent 20% of our sales in R&amp;D. And to put that in perspective, over the medium term, over the next 3 to 5 years, this will be around 1 billion that will go back into the product, more than anyone else, more than even the largest bank.</p><p>Clearly, we want to continue our geographic expansion. We've made some very strong inroads into our -- into the U.S., but that's still a market that we want to continue to capture, to capture the growth. Investing in sales and marketing as we've been doing for the last few years to ensure that we've got more specialized salespeople to capture that opportunity. Cloud as well, and we'll discuss cloud in quite some details in a moment, the opportunity on how to capture it.</p><p>Partners. Most technology side and the technology is evolving so fast. We work more and more with our technology partners. Is it Microsoft? Is it AWS? Or is it Google? As you know that we've announced an extension of our strategic partnership with them. Or it is NuoDB, a very interesting company where we invested into it, let's say, a modern database, which is a distributed database technology. And finally, using M&amp;A to strategically accelerate our growth. We only look at transactions that are able to complement, which are synergistic and [things] that will accelerate the growth of the group.</p><p>I'm pleased to say that in 2019, we made major progress in each one of those areas. If we start with the product, in 2019, at the start of the year, we started with the separation of Infinity and Transact to give choice to our customers. And early this year, we announced our cloud-based micro services to be able to offer hyperpersonalization with explainable AI to the distribution side and to allow continuous renovation for the largest banks on the Transact side.</p><p>We've made significant progress in the U.S., obviously, following the acquisition of Kony and Avoka. We've got now a very large structure in the U.S. We've got distribution in place. We've got products, amazing products to sell in the U.S. SaaS, our ACV grew 68% in 2019. And in Q4, it accelerated to around 130%. So extremely strong growth on our SaaS business.</p><p>We continue to expand on our partner ecosystem with more than 6,500 consultants, 12,000 developers community that can, through our APIs, extend the product leadership. And finally, 3 very strategic acquisition: Kony on the digital front end; Logical Glue on the explainable AI; and hTrunk on the data and analytics.</p><p>To capture that market, we benefit from 5 engine of growth. Transact is where we started. This is where we enjoy the largest market share today. But this is still a clear driver of growth for us. In 2019, we grew Transact at double digit. So we continue to be able to penetrate the banks. And with our microservices architecture now, we are offering even, for the largest banks, a way to transform at their own pace.</p><p>Infinity is the largest part of the market and Infinity is extremely exciting. Infinity grew in 2019 a multiple of the growth we had with Transact. This is all about offering personalized customer experiences. And we see banks that need to differentiate themselves, and that's how you can do that. So we are very confident that with our Infinity offering, which is best-in-class in the market, we will be able to continue to accelerate and gain market share and gain leadership in the digital front office.</p><p>Then payment, also very exciting. It grew very nicely as well in 2019 and we see lots of opportunities, some of them driven by regulation. And finally, fund administration, also growing at 8%, a slightly smaller market at $1.6 billion addressable for us.</p><p>So let's look at cloud and SaaS for a moment and look at some of the achievement. As I said, we had our first customer on the cloud in 2019 and that was really an industry-first. But I think what is exciting is how banks are using cloud as an enabler for change. And clearly, the last few years, we've seen a massive acceleration. And what is also very exciting about this is, and obviously, I mean, constant discussions with CEOs of banks. And all the time, I'm asking myself, this cloud deal or this SaaS deal, would it be possible to have position a traditional premise deal to that customer? And most of the time, and if it's not all the time, the clear answer is no. And SaaS allows for decent opportunity, allows for new models to be created, allows for banks to go to their Board and get the deal approved, which will not have been the case on the traditional on-premise infrastructure.</p><p>It brings agility, it brings scalability and the fact that with the cloud, the environment, we are ready to scale it up and down. So the cost infrastructure is much more affordable for a new vendor. So very exciting development on our SaaS business. You can see that we get today more than 1,000 customers using our SaaS offering. 50 of them are core banking customers. And today, 42% of our new deals are SaaS. And obviously, the growth on our ACV for the full year was at 2019.</p><p>But to put that in perspective of what it means, if you look for the one, some of you here, I know, have been looking at Temenos for quite a while, it took us 19 years to build a business of 100 million license bookings. 19 years, so when we started in '93 up to 2012. We expect by the end of 2020 to achieve an equivalent of 100 million in license with our SaaS business, which means that it will have taken us slightly less than 4 years to get there. So this gives you the magnitude of the acceleration. Within the Temenos history, we've never had such a growth driver. So that's super exciting. And this is why at the beginning, I said I'm even more confident on the ability to sustain our long-term license growth of more than 15%.</p><p>The U.S., as you know, is one of our strategic market. And later on, you are going to hear it live from our headquarters in the U.S. from Alexa, who is our new president from the Americas to discuss the opportunity in more detail. But I'm very pleased with the inroads we've been able to make in 2019. In the last few years, in fact, we've made a lot of progress in that market. Just in last year, significant growth in our revenues, grew at 38%. Massive growth on the headcount, 50% growth. What is very important, this was one of the things that we are missing, is clearly the distribution. We've got a very strong sales organization right now to be able to capture that opportunity, which increased by 57% in 2019.</p><p>We see Temenos Infinity as a clear driver for growth in the U.S. And as you know, banks in the U.S. do enjoy a higher return on equity. And for them, the ability to gain new customers, the ability to differentiate is extremely important. And that's why with Temenos Infinity, we give them the ability to do that. We give them the ability to gain new customers, we give them the ability to grow faster.</p><p>The scale also in market for core. In fact, we launched a very exciting proposal, which is a SaaS proposal for digital banks to allow them to go live in just 90 days. So that's quite exciting. And as I said, pipeline is building very nicely. And we'll hear more from Alexa in a moment.</p><p>It's more than Temenos today. Temenos, clearly, is at the middle of all of that. But it's a community. It's an extremely powerful community, and that community brings a lot of success. It's a community that get together on a yearly basis to -- at our TCF, that exchange between themselves, that challenge themselves, that learn from each other. So it's a very, very powerful community. And this is the point I've said that as soon as you get scale, as soon as you get credibility, your growth should accelerate. And that is the effect of that community.</p><p>So it's 8,000 Temenos people. We call ourselves Temenosians. It's 8,000 of us spread across the globe. It's 6,500 trained partners on our software. It's more than 3,000 customers. It's more than 100 FinTechs, which are on our marketplace. It's more than 12,000 developers that are part of our community. And it is 0.5 billion customers that rely on a daily basis on our software. So that's extremely powerful.</p><p>We talk a lot about why Temenos has been so successful. What is -- what was key to that success? And there are many elements of that and I think I mentioned quite some of them. But there is one thing that we are extremely proud internally, and I thought I should also share that with the market, which is our culture. And we call our culture, the name is, we call it Temenosity. That's the way we do things. We do things with Temenosity. And every one of us has a different view of what it is, but ultimately, it is about tenacity, it is about velocity, it is about responsibility, it is about community, about authenticity. And each of us have a different view. For me, it has always been about putting Temenos first. You put Temenos first, you know that this is the right decision.</p><p>It's always about the velocity. I've been with Temenos for 18 years, the ability to change, the ability to take decisions, it's amazing. And we proud ourselves about our culture. We believe it is one of the key element of our success. We value people. And as you know, we -- this is the Temenos key and we are all proud to wear our Temenos key, which remind us that people are the key. When you're in a business where you sell something which is intangible, the value in the people, people create the software, people sell that software, people take care of the customers. So we are extremely proud of our culture.</p><p>We are also proud on the progress we've made in our ESG initiatives. And we do believe that ESG leadership creates value. And it's now more than 3 years that we've structured our initiatives and we've been able to make a lot of contribution. And we are also proud to be able to contribute. And Kalliopi, who is running our sustainability program, will go into much more details. But this is something that we are all extremely proud to be able to contribute. And Temenos has always operated at the highest standard of sustainability and responsibility. So very proud of that.</p><p>So to conclude, I've shown that slide already. And we've got the credibility, we've got the leadership, we've got the product, we've got the customers. We've reached a major milestone of $1 billion of revenues. We are the category killer of banking software. And what we've seen in other industries is once you reach that stage -- and to reach that stage takes quite a bit of time. It took us 25 years. For other companies, it took longer or less. However, once you get there, what is clear is things [accelerate].</p><p>So this slide is not about thing that we'll be a $5 billion revenue in 5 years, even though clearly, I'll try to get there, yes. It's about saying that the acceleration once you get to that critical size, to that credibility, to that reference point, once you get that community, when this community accepts everything that you do. So we are very excited. We've got big ambitions. We've got a big market. We've got a huge opportunity and we want to capture it. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p><p>Let me introduce Mark, who as you know, has been running our product division for quite a period of time. And now he will also have the great pleasure of running our technology group. Thank you, Mark.</p><p>MARK WINTERBURN, CHIEF PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, TEMENOS AG: Good morning, everyone. As Max said, I'm Mark Winterburn. I run the Product and the Technology group. After me, we've got 2 sessions before coffee. We're going to show you Infinity and then we're going to talk about Transact, and there'll be a coffee break, and then we're going to do technology, going to do cloud, and then a bit about AI and then some demos. So that's the layout for the -- until we get to coffee break.</p><p>Max, in that session there, talked about product leadership so I want to just talk a bit about that before I get Brian up to talk about Infinity. I'm going to start here, which is where I normally start in these sessions. We're very proud of this. It's -- when people say, \"Well, why is Temenos at the forefront? Why have you got this product leadership?\" It's not by accident. It's because we've been investing for over 25 years, and that investment has increased. And frankly, the more deals we win, the more M&amp;A we do, the more skills we add to an existing world-class team, round and round the world goes and I'll share a bit later how our velocity is increasing now. So I've seen a gap between us and the competition. Max talked about how we outsell them. That gap is growing for me as the velocity of this thing increases.</p><p>So in the past -- let me put up a bit more detail about this slide. Client server back in the day would have been a proprietary database, would have been UNIX and stuff. We went through multi-tier. We started to utilize Microsoft Stack, SQL Server, Oracle Database. You go through cloud-ready and we started to talk about platforms for user experience, REST APIs, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it genuinely has, over this period, been revolutionary and also agnostic. We do not and have never told clients what technology to use. We leverage the best in the marketplace. And you'll see when we talk about cloud, that continues.</p><p>Max talked about the fact that we've got a lead in technology and we've got a lead in the package functionality. That package functionality lead continues to grow. And again, looking right back at the start, we'd have been adding trade finance, we'd have been adding various other corporate wealth. And then as we've rolled forward again into API frameworks that allow us to offer enormous range of depth of APIs, but also things like robo-advisers and faster payments and stuff like that. So it is both streams.</p><p>So what does that look like now? Well, it's resulted in a very clean architecture. So omni-channel. Then it was only a year ago that we split Infinity from Transact to allow us to offer banks transformation in whatever order they wanted to do it, to allow us to offer best-in-class, both in the front, as Max was talking about distribution, but also in the back, in manufacturing. Payments has always been built to that architecture from the start as we built it ground-up a number of years ago. So very clean omnichannel, leveraging the data lake and AI. And we talked a bit about M&amp;A earlier, that hTrunk, and then really helped us on the day-to-day. We leveraged that and embedded that quite quickly. Logical Glue on the explainable AI. These things, we get them, we embed them quickly.</p><p>And again, nice and clean stack. And then risk and compliance either through AML, FCM, but also the huge investments we make in the country model and understanding the regulatory requirements in the different countries in which we operate.</p><p>All good, all nice and clean. Then, of course, Max talked about huge growth in SaaS and cloud. And of course, because we're agnostic, we offer that on all the major cloud providers, and some that -- Alibaba, for instance, is a recent addition. If we run it, fine, we'll run it SaaS for you the terminal software. Client runs it, they get the choice. And then as we see new technologies emerging around Kubernetes or OpenShift and now Anthos, we'll be agnostic in those as well. If they're the right thing, if they're leading technologies that clients want to leverage, guess what, we'll have tested it and optimized to run it on those platforms. And of course, those that still want to run on-premise, we run on-premise, same stack, ultra-high performance, reliability, et cetera.</p><p>I wanted to dig into this slide a little bit. So you've got a nice clean stack. What's going on in there since we made the announcement about Infinity and Transact. Well, this slide shows the enormous amount of work. And if you look at the distribution services, Infinity, and in the microservices piece in Transact, this is giving banks choice about how to take value, in what order to take value and to take value more quickly, right? So there is an enormous amount of work going on in the product group to get this stuff done.</p><p>And I showed the innovation since the '90s, and how proud we are at that. What you are seeing here in one slide in 1 year, if you will, would have taken years in the past. We've got some real velocity now. And I think there are some reasons for that. One, the architecture is clean, and we've worked for years for that to be the case, and we'll continue to do so. Two, we attract world-class talent, either organically or through M&amp;A. Product group now is over 3,000 people. So you've got a real army of talent there to be consistently changing and improving the product on a daily basis.</p><p>And then secondly, the split between Infinity and Transact has allowed us to really concentrate on what underpins the value there and to move more quickly than in what -- than if it was treated as just one stack. So what you're seeing there in a year would have taken years before that. And that velocity is increasing. We're seeing us be able to deliver more concurrently with better quality than we ever could. And I only see that increasing as we move forward. So a very key slide, and you'll hear more about this as the guys get up and talk about Transact and Infinity in more detail.</p><p>All good, okay? So product leadership in good hands there. But how does the client take that and implement that? And I've spoken a little bit on one of these in the past about UTP, which is how we changed the way we build and deploy software to be ready for the cloud. So we started to make the packages of code that we build smaller, to be far more focused in small bits of code, those are checked in every day. The full regression run overnight. So we are coding on a daily basis and putting that into the system, and it's automatically tested. We then take that a step further and allow our clients to consume it at that rate should they be ready, should they want to, right? So UTP over a period of time has become the continuous deployment [TCD].</p><p>Are banks yet ready to take software upgrades on a daily basis? Frankly, no. But they will be as cloud becomes far, far more pervasive, that ability to take a change and implement it really quickly will define, I think, the nimbleness of the bank, right? And we can do it daily now. We can build in the morning and consume it in the afternoon, as it says in the strapline. We've already got banks taking software every month. So roll that out, monthly deployment, they take that software monthly or there's quarterly, as the cloud becomes, as I say, more pervasive, you're going to see more of that. That timeline is going to speed up. So the speed of innovation for us has been -- the speed of innovation for our clients will speed up, too, as they become more nimble.</p><p>And this is all underpinned by use of the cloud, right? I remember when I started, it's ages, going to test this still, I've got a code imported deep of it. Now you can spin-up an environment then so you can have a Transact or an Infinity deployment there and then ready to test. It's the sandbox environment we use with our marketplace. This is a much easier way to build and test code and then deploy it. And as you'll see, we ship the code, the bank's doing its own work essentially. With the extend phase, they then assemble and release. And what we're saying is that whole process automated using cloud technology is a game changer to the banks. And we're seeing a lot of interest in that approach to break down the difficulties involved in employing transformation in core or payment software.</p><p>So I'll just let this thing work its magic. Well, all I would say on this is we do a lot of change. If you've got over 3,000 people in the product group, you're deploying a lot of change. What is the process we use to manage that change? Well, clearly, we're listening to customers, we're talking to prospects, we talk to the industry, we keep our eye on competition, obviously. We look at what other industries are doing to see if there are things that would be of use for us. And all of that is a set of possible changes, our backlog, if you will, and we pump that through a system, it's online, and we have a regular product board C-level meeting where we get into those things where people come along with propositions, which we agree or disagree. They could end up in core of the software that we ship to all of our clients, could be a regional upgrade, a change which allows us to prosecute a region or there's change in a region.</p><p>We do occasionally do code just for single customers rather than for the whole product. So it could end up there, or, of course, we could reject it. And the way we work at pace now is we have a standing meeting every month. But where we see opportunities to do change more quickly, we take those opportunities, run the meeting, make the decision and go. So we've had to invest in the product group, particularly, because the development machine is running at such a pace, we do not want it to get in the way of that. So this is just to show how we manage all that change. We also do a rolling governance review, which takes each month, what have we delivered, what have we yet to deliver, just adds on, so that's a rolling 12-month review of everything we commit to on a monthly basis.</p><p>We had a great kickoff in January. I think kind of 1,000 people in a room. We spent a couple of days with the presales guys going through what we've done. We had a day in the main plenary, and we couldn't get through everything that we wanted to talk about. Broadly, a product day, some of the bits and pieces. So what I just tried to capture here is in the main blocks of Temenos Infinity and Transact, kind of things that we've been working on to bring to market. And then underneath, across all of our product lines, we continue to invest in that organic that drive into the feature function. Everything -- we've got teams that work on each one. It's not as if we just do Infinity or Transact, we do it across the piece, technology and the various business units for feature function.</p><p>A further couple of sessions with some of the guys in the room if you want more time for us on this. Now isn't the time, but we could do sessions to go into a bit more detail. But the key that we want to concentrate on now is around the Infinity and Transact piece. So what I'm going to do is get Brian Abele up and he's going to talk about the Infinity piece first. Thank you. Brian?</p><p>BRIAN ABELE, PRODUCT MANAGER OF TEMENOS INFINITY, TEMENOS AG: Thank you, Mark. So the -- good afternoon, everybody. The 5 drivers of growth that -- obviously, that Max has talked about, we're going to start talking about individually a few of those, and we're going to start off with Infinity.</p><p>Infinity really represents the biggest market opportunity that we've seen. You saw at the very beginning that -- in Max's presentation, what the size of that total opportunity was. And what we're really seeing as far as what the banks are asking about, what they're really going through right now is they're not asking the question whether they need to go through a digital transformation. What they're doing is they're trying to figure out how to go through that digital transformation. What are the steps that they can take given the fact that they have legacy technology, given the fact that they have regulatory burdens that they have upon them, given the fact that they can't do massive projects just on a whim like that. So what we've been able to do is figure out exactly how we can go help our customers go through that digital transformation in the digital front office with our Infinity solution.</p><p>So the overall market opportunity, which I'm going to talk through with you guys, and then I'll talk a little bit about what Infinity is and how we're actually taking it out into the marketplace. The digital front office solution for us is one that can do the 3 primary objectives that they need to be able to do in the digital front office: market to your customers, acquire new customers and service those customers. That's the bottom line. You have to be able to do that in that digital front office piece. $5.9 billion is that overall opportunity, growing at 8%, so very significant growth. And this solution that we have for this particular market, as we said, is Temenos Infinity.</p><p>And Infinity is really driven off of 3 kind of key tenets. So when we think about Infinity and how we're talking about it, how our customers are responding to it and listening to it is the fact that it's driven off of these 3 principles. Number one, it's an omni-channel full-service platform. So Mark just kind of talked about the AI-driven, API-based, micro-services-driven, everything is being used leveraging these open technologies. So the platform is the key component, the starting point for how we are able to go deliver in that digital front office piece.</p><p>The second piece is that hyper-personalized digital experiences. Those that are native, regardless of whatever type of resource or channel or glass that a customer is coming in from. So whether they're coming in from a browser, from an app, from a wearable device, any of those types of interactions that they are bringing forward, they are coming forward, but it's in a personalized way. It's in a way that's very meaningful and unique in a market of one type of technology approach and experience approach.</p><p>And finally, it's all built on the one thing that really makes us stand out, those banking-specific distribution services that allow for the open banking needs that are arising as part of this whole digital transformation that's taking place.</p><p>So the thing that does make us unique is the fact that we do have those distribution services, we have the technology, we have the -- absolutely the entire breadth and depth of solutions available to us. So when we look at the competitive landscape, whether it's actually having the full set of technology, the full set of capabilities, the way in which it can get delivered, partnerships that exist, there's really nobody out there who can do all of those things the way that Temenos can. And that gives us an advantage, and it gives us great opportunity to go, continue to open ourselves up and get ourselves into more opportunities and expand the overall footprint that we have for our digital front office. It's a very exciting place for us to be in, especially given the fact that our competitors really can't stack up to us based on all of the different things that we have available to us.</p><p>So how are we coming to market? What are we bringing forward when it comes to our digital banking solutions? It's really a holistic approach. And it's really any of the type of person or entity that a financial institution is going to be able to serve. So we serve the entire gamut running from the retail customers for their basic needs, the onboarding and origination that they need to be able to open up any type of account and be able to be serviced on those types of accounts.</p><p>Gig and small business. The -- one of the fastest-growing labor markets is the freelancer worker force, right? The gig people. The people who are driving for Amazon delivery, or who are doing fibers on the side in order to make either multiple jobs or on top of an existing job. And there's a set of services that we have to be able to offer to those people, and we're providing those services as part of our overall Infinity solution stack: Wealth, business, corporate. The entire range. Everything from the most complex trade finance type of transaction to the very basic retail needs. That entire set of capabilities is something that we have within the Temenos Infinity stack, again, making us unique and helping us be able to solve the specific problems that we're hearing from our banks on a regular basis.</p><p>So how are they using the Infinity technology? And what are they doing in order to provide services to their various constituencies? It's really important to think about this because digital transformation really is not just about the front-end experience. It's not just about the consumers. It's also how the bank interacts with that technology and what tools are available for them to be able to better serve the customers and be more efficient and be more profitable and market the right way to those customers.</p><p>So we have 4 different personas that we really target when we talk about our solutions for Infinity. Number one is our customers. So whether they're coming in from a mobile device, like Max here actually going through his own application and his personalized view, so you can see how hyper-personalized our solution can be. To be able to offer services to those customers, again, regardless of the touch point that they're coming in from, whether they're coming in from an app or coming in from a mobile -- or a browser or any other type of device.</p><p>On the branch side and in the support elements, you've got to be able to support those customers. You have to be able to service them. You have to provide the right types of interactions when they contact or when they reach out to be able to answer questions about a marketing catalog or to be able to better understand what their needs are to provide the right types of services to them. So we offer those solutions as well. We have a product called [Spotlight] where all of that is available to that back office user, so they can see a more comprehensive view of what is available to them. And it's all driven from our analytics and all of the data that comes through our applications that we can go and drive those kind of more meaningful conversations to take place.</p><p>Product owners. Being able to create products and understand the profitability of the products and what products need to be targeted and marketed for specific people, how to get those products developed and rolled out and available to specific customer bases or specific pools of people that you were going out to target. Those are a very key constituent that we have solutions for to drive that.</p><p>And then, of course, the technology. All of those -- all of the elements that underpin this, everything is API-driven. So being able to not just have solutions that come out of the box, but to be able to integrate and to incorporate other third parties or other components that are just part of their natural ecosystem, we have the tools and the technology that's not something very difficult to use, but is very simple, and in many cases, are just drag and drop-type technology that allows for the integration of our solutions to other platforms. So It's a very, very powerful sets of tools.</p><p>So Infinity, as you kind of think about the entire banking value chain, is really kind of that channel view, how people are interacting, how people are coming into and experiencing the bank and the financial institution in some way, shape or form, and it's leveraging experience APIs that go into our distribution services. And I'll talk about those here in just a second. That really kind of stand out. That's where we're actually taking some of the real true banking capabilities and making them standalone and deployable solutions so that as banks go through that digital transformation, they can deploy those services to really meet very specific needs and have a much more robust road map to get to a complete digital transformation over time.</p><p>And then, of course, the manufacturing on the back end to actually handle all of the transactions and the payments and the other different pieces that are kind of the core elements of how financial institution runs. So really, Infinity is that kind of driving force. But how we see this in our customers and in the environments that they serve is really interesting.</p><p>So recently, we're talking with a financial institution. This is about as close as a topography as we could potentially draw for them. We were going through an exercise with them. And from the very beginning, you can see all of the touch points that they have to be able to support. They have to support all of those touch points because they're constantly getting asked by their customers, they're constantly getting the competition from FinTechs who are coming after them saying, \"You've got to be able to have augmented reality when it comes to a banking interaction, because there's a FinTech who provides that. And if you don't offer it, then your customer is going to pick up, take their accounts, and they're going to go move over to that other FinTech.\" Right?</p><p>So all of these new technologies are coming -- are coming available to our customers. And so now we have to be able to respond. What's happening is that as they individually get deployed into specific areas, they have to make direct connections into the various back-end systems that the financial institution already has. And as we kind of talked about before, making the big change, changing something on the back end becomes a lot more challenging.</p><p>So how are we going to go deliver services? How are we going to go through and provide the right types of product capabilities and digital front office services when we have this kind of environment? Because this kind of environment creates problems. The problems that it creates for those customers are things like application drop offs. North of 50% of applications that are coming through from an onboarding standpoint from one of those channels will just disappear. And that's a person who was going through the exercise of actually trying to originate an account at that financial institution, and they're just walking away. And so that kind of drop off is just not acceptable. You can't have those levels of drop-offs and be able to continue to succeed because that's the bread and butter. That's your new customers that are coming through the door.</p><p>Lost marketing leads. Wherever people are coming in from is not being captured. You're not seeing what's actually happening when it comes to the delivery of those leads and making sure that you are following up.</p><p>And the third major problem that we see in this kind of an ecosystem is just the high legacy platform cost. Millions, millions of dollars are being spent on this in order to preserve this ecosystem that is not able to provide the velocity and the pace and the speed with which the banks are expected to be able to behave.</p><p>So we have addressed that with our Infinity solution. So when you have Infinity at the financial institution, you can actually take those front-end pieces, those -- and whether they are from actual Infinity applications that we actually have or it's things that the financial institutions themselves will actually build out and deploy themselves, but leveraging those distribution services in the middle to create the logic, if you will, or the functionality, the capabilities that will allow them to maintain some of their existing applications, but have a more consistent experience. This provides that seamless onboarding experience. It provides the ability for the banks to see in one place what is happening when it comes to servicing their front office and servicing their customers in that kind of a way.</p><p>So this is a much better approach. It's driven off of APIs. So everything is open. We're not trying to lock everything down here because there's just a lot of different systems that we have to be able to plug into, and that's really critical to us is being able to have that openness, that ability to be able to integrate.</p><p>So the distribution services that we have within Temenos Infinity specifically. These are just the sampling of some of the distribution services that we have rolled out. Origination, obviously, is critical for us, onboarding, funds authorization. These are all the types of microservices that we have started to build out and are rolling out to some of our customers currently. So this is the area where we will continue to see that focus for us, because the distribution services really provide a set of kind of very important value propositions.</p><p>Number one, it provides the ability to personalize and create a level of explainability for all of the underlying artificial intelligence that's taking place in some of those microservices. So number one, for the personalization, we can actually be a very focused, understanding with the data that we have to be able to really provide a tailored experience and provide the right type of product at the right time for that particular customer. Super important to be able to do that. And not only can we do that, we can actually, with our explainable AI, and we'll talk about it later in the afternoon, is really provide detailed information about why that particular recommendation was made for that particular customer. So it's a very, very powerful tool, all being delivered through our distribution microservices.</p><p>The deployment and the cost of operating this, because these are run in the cloud, they are standalone entities. So now we have the ability to deploy these as a standalone entity, and they are cloud-based, so they can scale up and scale down as needed based on the usage tied to that. And again, we'll talk about the cloud pieces later on, too.</p><p>The time to market gets accelerated as a result of this, so we can plug-and-play these microservices, so that we can go deliver specific targeted types of solutions and we can offer those to allow the banks to be able to push their products out the door a lot faster.</p><p>Scalability and availability, obviously, comes from running in the cloud. And then, obviously, the adoption of new business models. As things change, as FinTechs come about and there's new challenges and new ways in which we have to be able to serve them, we have better tools available to us in order to be able to do that.</p><p>So that's the Infinity standalone solution. And as we have talked about, Infinity is something that we can offer separate. That was one of the big strategic decisions that we made over a year ago. We've made significant investment to make this solution the market-leading solution when it comes to digital front offices. So now what I want to do is bring up Alex over here, who's going to talk about the market-leading core solution, Transact.</p><p>ALEX DURET, PRODUCT DIRECTOR OF TRANSACT, TEMENOS AG: Thanks, Brian. So Transact, I guess, flagship core banking system and happens to be still the core of our business. It's a growing area. It keeps growing. We mentioned the 7% average growth that's still taking place in the market, and we want to be a part of that growth. And our value proposition is still the same, we want to be able to deliver faster and cheaper transformation to our clients. You'll notice that we're not talking about T24 anymore, but rather just Temenos Transact, and I will explain a little bit what it means for the market.</p><p>In terms of our positioning versus the competition, we're quite happy to have a lot of people to contend with such as the Infosys, Oracle, Sopra, and the newcomers like Mambu that you've seen from last year. We've seen a number of newcomers coming into the market with a different offering, and this is how we compare against these players.</p><p>So in terms of the scale and the scope of our business, there's a number of equivalent, the -- what Max used to call the old legacy players, which we compete on a daily basis across the world. They have also a global offering. They cover all segments. But nobody ticks all the boxes. So nobody is able to offer an integrated end-to-end capability. So Infinity plus Transact plus AI plus Data Lake, nobody offers that. So as a bank, when you want to transform, you need to go -- if you're not talking to Temenos, you need to go and talk to a multiplicity of vendors and find a way to integrate all of this together. We de-risk these projects because we come with preintegrated software, end-to-end.</p><p>A number of new vendors are cloud agnostic. They were born with the cloud, they were born with new technologies, but that's what we call new legacy, because most of the time, they're -- or actually, none of them are really cloud agnostic. You will have seen from Mark's slides, we're operating on AWS, on Azure, on Google, on OpenShift, et cetera, et cetera. You take a player like Mambu, for instance, they are completely tied to AWS, that's their SaaS business running on AWS, that's the only thing they can do. It's not sufficient. Because in terms of regulation, in terms of compliance, you need to be able to operate on multiple clouds. Typically, in Europe, there's guidance, strong guidance by the European Central Bank that banks need to be able to operate on multiple clouds. So at some point, it will create an issue for these vendors. On the other hand, we are completely cloud agnostic.</p><p>Very few vendors provide a real upgrade path. We're a product company, so that's what we do. A number of our competition is -- they are services companies. So their interest is in actually selling the software, but actually selling the services on top of that. That's not what we do. We sell the product, we want to make sure that it works and the bank is happy to run with it. And then they take regular upgrades, and we'll be talking about microservices and how we can enhance that. And then you show that you can upgrade. You're not stuck with new legacy, as we now call it.</p><p>And in addition to that, I think we're probably the only vendor in the market having this concept of country model banks. So we provide not only the software that applies to all banks in the world, but we also come with [prepackaged software for] different countries where we operate. So as a bank, you have their confidence that you'll be able, not only to upgrade your core platform, but you'll also be able to comply with new regulations in that particular country. And that's quite a differentiator, and we see this -- a lot of interest from prospects and, of course, multiple benefits for our clients.</p><p>Now one of the slides that Max presented was very interesting. It showed the addressable market, the huge addressable market, and actually the spend on third-party software, which is just a fraction of that, to be honest. We want to change that. And how we're going to change that is by changing the architecture of the software, moving into a full microservice architecture. And the target, the main target for this, all the larger banks. The tier 1s and Tier 2 banks of this world who today have probably a lot of very good reasons to change, to renovate, but actually another number of very good reasons not to change. They usually operate on very complex old legacy software, we call spaghetti software. It's very difficult to change and they find it just too risky to change.</p><p>In reality, they think also, a lot of them when we speak with them, they believe that what they have today, it just runs as a clock, it's cheap to operate, so why would I change? Very often, they don't realize the cost of change. It's not factored in the maintenance. So they say, \"Well, compare your maintenance I have today, it's very cheap. It's -- I have a very few -- a small team running is very fine.\" But what they forget to add usually is the cost of change. Every time there's a new regulation, every time they want to launch a new product, that has an impact on the core banking, that's usually on a separate line, and that is very expensive.</p><p>Another reason for change is it's old legacy. They may have teams that are aging. A lot of people start retiring. Cobol, after 30 years you get less and less people and less and less expertise. And in countries such as the U.K. here, you even hear about horror stories of banks not being able to serve their clients, and crashes, and bugs, et cetera, et cetera. So some of these banks even have a real operational issue right now, but they're still scared to change because it's so complex, because it's so risky.</p><p>So we're tackling that with a microservice approach. Rather than coming with a full core banking replacement, even if it's progressive, we're going to be able to offer them piecemeal replacement of very specific functions, one by one. You don't have to replace all of your systems together, you can go really one by one. The ones we are launching this year are the key ones, let's say, for any retail bank, it's accounts and deposits, it's retail lending, it's the ability to manage their products centrally in a product hub and it's the ability to price at a much more granular level and much closer to their customers.</p><p>There's a number of other services, smaller technical services I will not talk about, and this is really a road map. So we're starting in 2020 to leverage the functional richness of this software and make it available to really to the larger banks. So if a bank has an operational issue, wants to change something with their account processing system, which is really usually the core of the core, now they can do that. They don't need to migrate their customer database, they don't need to change their GL, they don't need to change their reporting, they can just focus on that. So we are mitigating the risk by making it a much smaller upgrade project, okay? Same goes for retail lending. Why did we pick this too to begin with? Because we're very strong. We have a very strong product in those areas. So we're quite convinced that it will address most of the bank's requirements and probably a lot more.</p><p>The next 2, the product hub and the pricing hub, are even more interesting, because this is something that you can see as an add-on on top of an existing legacy platform. You don't even have to change your core platform, your spaghetti. You can add these blocks on top of it. Many banks have multiplicity of systems and no real clear view of everything that they offer as a product. So with the product hub, we want to offer them the capability to have a single point of reference for all of their products in a hierarchical form, and this is a place where you can even create new products that will be feeding into the underlying systems. This is -- we see a lot of interest. Just mentioning this a little bit has raised a lot of attention on the market, and in particular, in conjunction with Infinity, we have banks saying, \"I just want to replace my digital platform at the front, but the back is such a mess, it's impossible just to upgrade. I want to replace the front, but the back is so complex. Can you give us a way by which we have a clear view of all of our products?\" So yes. This is what we can do with a product hub.</p><p>And same goes with the pricing. If you're pricing, your operations in multiple segregated systems, you don't really -- you're not able to aggregate all of that at a customer level. You're not able to price based on the relationship you have with a particular customer, which is what all the new banks are doing. This is what they're very good at. They know their customer. They have a single view of their customer, and they're able to price according to the conditions and the particular context of that particular customer. If you're dealing with a legacy system with many different systems, it's impossible. So again, we are proposing this additional box on top of the legacy, a pricing hub, which is something we use today in our core banking. So it's proven, it works, it's got a lot of great features and we want to make that available to any bank, even if they're not using any other Temenos software.</p><p>So the benefits, and this is also why we decided to make that transition from T24 to Temenos Transact, it's to really make it clear to the market that there's a change. There is a before and an after in terms of the architecture of the product and the benefit that it provides. For our existing clients, it's also very beneficial. It means they will be able to upgrade module by module rather than upgrading the entire core system. So nowadays, when a bank wants to upgrade a core system in our galaxy of customers, they tend to do it every 2 or 3 years, we are now giving them the ability to upgrade much more frequently and to take the innovation as they come. So this is something actually almost 100% of our clients have been waiting for. So it's now available.</p><p>For the larger banks, as I mentioned, it's an enabler. The message to all these bigger banks, it's not impossible to change anymore. We're making it possible. We're enabling this progressive and safe renovation.</p><p>And with the pricing hub and the product hub and new features that we are going to launch this year or next year, we're also delivering enterprise capabilities on top of the existing systems.</p><p>So there is a lot of value in this. Again, if you think of the spend on third-party software versus what banks actually really spend on their in-house legacy, we want to capture a much bigger fraction of that.</p><p>It also enables us to have a much clearer view and segmentation of the market, of our clients and our targets. For the small banks, microservices, you could say it's irrelevant. We're running their business, so whether it's running as microservices or not, it's not really an issue for them. This is actually -- the benefits are for us as a SaaS operator. It makes things easier for us to roll out internally. But for a small bank, we want to sell them the full Transact, all the integrated capabilities, regular upgrades and we manage it for you, Mr. client.</p><p>For the middle tier, on the other hand, the ones that are just slightly too big to be operating on a SaaS model, then the real benefit is what I've just mentioned, these partial upgrades. You can take innovation much quicker, you don't have to wait for 2 or 3 years, you don't have to build your own legacy, your own customization because you can't wait, now you get the new enhancements from Temenos much quicker.</p><p>And of course, again, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, largely an untapped market for the third-party vendors such as us. We want to be able to offer them those individual microservices and enable them to start this transformation. Again, we want a bigger piece of the pie.</p><p>There's -- besides microservices, I don't have time to -- Mark mentioned, this is a 77, I think, enhancements across the product range. I just wanted to highlight a number of other things, because it's not just about microservices. Today, the market conditions are very tough for banks with their retail clientele. It's very difficult to make any money with retail clients so we see a lot of attention back on SME and corporate banking. So we've been investing heavily end of last year and beginning of this year into corporate banking, which, admittedly, we hadn't been doing for a while. So we are now back in business. We have a very strong competitive offering. We have very positive feedback from prospects compared to -- even compared to best-of-breed solutions. We are winning some deals against the old established players in this market with this new offering that we're building around corporate lending and corporate banking in general. So this is very exciting because, again, retail banking has tough conditions, so we see a lot of traction in this market.</p><p>So on retail banking, well, we already have a very strong offering. So we basically, year after year, we keep building upon that. In the background, we are replacing the entire architecture, changing the architecture. But from a functional perspective, we just keep adding and incrementing the capabilities of the software, in particular, around pricing.</p><p>And last but not least, we're leveraging the acquisition of Kony, even for the core banking. So we are using the great Kony technology to enhance the way we present the software to the users of the system, to back office people. Because nowadays, the trend is very clear, back office people need to do more with less. So they need to process more transactions, they need to be -- they need to work -- to provide -- to exhibit a lot more productivity, but how can they do that? So we're investigating a number of things such as robotic process automation, such as artificial intelligence. But right now, we're also thinking about what the users do in their daily jobs, the manual tasks and we want to help them with that with new user agents. And again, the feedback we get from the few prospects that have seen the very first prototypes are very promising.</p><p>That's it for me. I think I was the only person between you and the break. So Adam?</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Right. We're going to stop for a quick coffee break, caffeine injection, for 20 minutes. If everyone will be back in the room at 11 a.m. sharp, and we'll move on with the next session. Thanks very much.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Welcome back, everyone. I hope you managed to grab some coffee. I would like to introduce to the stage, Colin Jarrett, our Chief Cloud and Delivery Officer. It was announced yesterday evening that Colin has joined our Executive Committee. Colin's background, he came from Accenture, joined Temenos and is running development, been running our cloud operations and made a major impact on that. And now very proud that he's stepped up and joined the Executive Committee. So I'll hand over to Colin to run through our SaaS and Cloud section. Thank you.</p><p>COLIN JARRETT, CHIEF CLOUD AND DELIVERY OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, TEMENOS AG: Thanks, Adam. Hello. So it's Colin Jarrett. So promoted yesterday to be the Chief Cloud and Delivery Officer. And I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity, but let me explain why.</p><p>I think this year, we'll see a real transformation in both our company and in Temenos -- sorry, in Temenos and in the market. Now that's something you hear quite a lot. We do a lot of transformation. We say this is going to be the year. I think this is the year when we will see more cloud deals than on-prem deals. Cloud will be the predominant part of our business in terms of the number of deals that we're doing. That's transformational. I think this will be the year when in the U.S., we will have a bank go live from signing in 90 days. So a new bank, new digital bank, launching 90 days from signing. I think that's transformational for the banking industry. Yes? And it's a huge privilege for me to be running our cloud operations during this year.</p><p>You've seen lots of slides today. You've had a lot of information to take on board, yes? I think there's really 2 messages I want you to take away from the slides we're going to go through, yes? First one, unprecedented level of growth. When you saw Max's slides earlier, we said, \"In 4 years, the cloud business has delivered the value that it [has turned out] to deliver in 19 years.\" I think that's unprecedented, yes? I think then when you look forward and you start saying, \"What about demand?\" I think the demand for SaaS is unstoppable, yes? When we look at, it's not a vision, it's not an idea, it's a proven concept that banks are now spending money on and are hungry for, yes? It's a transformational year, unprecedented growth, huge opportunity. They are the messages from the slides I'll go through now.</p><p>Okay. A quick recap. What are we talking about [with stats]? We're talking about bringing the power of cloud, combining that with the power of the Temenos' products and putting that into a package, which is hosted and operated by Temenos. So we're talking about cost efficiencies, we're talking about operational efficiencies being delivered to our clients through cloud, through our products throughout our Temenos operations, okay?</p><p>You've seen pictures like this before in some of the earlier presentations. I think the idea of the winning combination that Max talked about earlier, it's the extensive product, it's the 25 years building out feature and function that really can't be rivaled. It's about the clean architecture, the future-proofed architecture that is cloud native, API-driven through continuous deployment that can't be rivaled. And then on top of that, it's now building in the operational expertise within Temenos and the partner ecosystem, again, makes this an absolutely category-killer for -- and kind of the reason why we're seeing the level of growth that we're seeing at the moment, yes? So I think from a SaaS offering, no one can touch that. We compare favorably. I probably would have said it a little bit stronger.</p><p>This is the unprecedented growth. You saw something quite similar from this earlier from Max, yes? And that'd be kind of the one image or one impression on everybody as they leave the room, yes? In 4 years, we achieved what it took Temenos 19 years to achieve with the on-prem model, yes? 42% of new deals are now on cloud. I expect this to be the year that becomes above 50%, transformational in the way we think about our deal structures. 68% ACV growth, yes? It's the real driver behind the business. But I would also echo something Max said earlier about this being additive, yes? When we look at it as a combined business, we see this as growing the overall footprint, growing the overall customer base as an additive service. The other part on this is, whilst we're growing at this rate, it's become very important that we're investing in building our internal capability, yes? There's always growing pains when you're growing at this sort of speed.</p><p>So investing in our operating capabilities. Increasing our headcount in our operations by over 100% last year. Building out our central command center in India with specialists, dedicated resources in T24 inside and out and understand how to operate it using that capability. Investing in improved tooling, improved automation so that when you run a COB, the pre-COB, the COB, the post-COB, all automated functions that don't require manual intervention. So investing in the operational excellence whilst we're growing at this rate is something that we've been doing proactively, we continue to do and is, again, something we'll continue to invest in during 2019 (sic) [2020].</p><p>We bought Avoka and Kony. That has brought with it many good cloud skills. They are cloud-native companies, and that has expanded our overall capability. We now have 5 different regional centers based on the acquisitions that we're taking on from Kony. So we're in Australia, within Latin America, within North America, we're in Europe and with our central command center in India, there're 5 centers in total.</p><p>That's kind of the growth story. Well, the other thing I said was, yes, the demand for SaaS is unstoppable. We see $21.5 billion of SaaS spend already. Projected growth rate 22%. 15% of bank applications are already on the cloud. This isn't an idea. This is proven. Banks are adopting this now. We see that with the greenfield banks. When -- the banks are getting difficulty implementing because of their spaghetti, because of their legacy, a drive towards greenfield, and in greenfield, a drive towards SaaS, okay?</p><p>If we take a bit of a deep dive and say, \"Okay. We understand globally that there's a demand,\" from a strategic point of view, we see specific opportunity within the U.S. market. And when you look at the U.S. market, we see interest rates are low. We have a low interest rate environment, which is driving cost pressures, yes? So from a manufacturing perspective, reducing the cost of manufacturing of products, critical in the U.S. We see new entrants and new digital banks and the acceptance of digital only. We see the rise of the FinTechs, adding additional competitive forces in the market. And on top of that, you've got the specifics around the U.S. regulation. So we see a global market that's driving towards SaaS. And in the U.S., we see a perfect storm of cost pressure, competitive pressure, regulatory pressure. And to resolve this, we see that the industry needs a fast, flexible, future-proofed, low-cost offering to help new digital banks launch quickly.</p><p>So we're incredibly pleased to announce on 21st of January our new U.S. SaaS model offering, which will allow customers to go live in 90 days from signing. How do we achieve that? First of all, it's preconfigured for the banking landscape in the U.S. So we come with a preconfigured model ready with U.S. It's a front-to-back model, so it's rich in functionality. It's out of the box. So it's coming back to that point around being preconfigured. It's fast. Time to market is critical here, yes? And we're able to continuously update it. So the future-proofing and rollout of new functionality as we continue through our Temenos continuous deployment processes allows us to constantly update our clients on this model bank. It has rich functionality from day 1.</p><p>We have the checking accounts, savings accounts, the things you'd expect to find. In addition, we have onboarding functionality, allows us to onboard new customers in 3 minutes. But not only do we have that functionality, we will then expand it with new functionality that will then be delivered through our continuous deployment so that we constantly keep refreshing and updating the U.S. offering.</p><p>So what we're offering is the best technology with the best service provider for a U.S. opportunity, where we can roll out in 90 days from day 1 for greenfield banks. We think that's going to be a major competitive advantage and an industry changer in the U.S. That's all I wanted to cover in this session.</p><p>I'm going to hand over to Tony, who's going to talk about technology. Thank you.</p><p>TONY COLEMAN, CLOUD TECHNOLOGY DIRECTOR, TEMENOS AG: Thanks, Colin. Morning everyone. My name is Tony Coleman and, indeed, I'm going to talk about technology for a few minutes. So the technology that we're talking about today underpins everything that we do in our software landscape. So it permeates every single piece of the software stack. It's not just Transact. It's not just Infinity. It's across everything. And just to drill in a little bit on some of the words. So we're cloud-agnostic, meaning that we give our customers the choice of which clouds to run on. We're cloud-native, meaning that we leverage the managed services, and the architecture is designed to run in the cloud. And we're distributed multi-cloud, meaning that you can not only choose which clouds to run on, but if you choose to do so, run active-active across clouds at the same time. And all of that is on a loosely coupled, event-driven microservices architecture.</p><p>Why do you need all that? You need all of that, and you'll see in the demos in a minute, banks need technology to deliver an exceptional customer experience. So what does that look like? So not only do you need a best-in-class core product engine with its loosely coupled, event-driven architecture, you need that supplemented and indeed designed and embedded with AI, be that explainable AI or RPA. And all of that rich functionality, every single thing you need to be better exposed is APIs. Not only do you need that, you need a distribution platform that's going to take all of that rich functionality, enhance it with distribution services, again exposable through APIs, and leverage AI again to create intelligent services, so pulling all of that together. All of that AI needs to be powered by data. Training those models needs data. That's where the data lake comes in. Not only that, you need to pull all this together to the channels using a multi-device omnichannel platform, so you can pick up on one device and carry on, on another.</p><p>So this is banking. It's a highly regulated industry. You need to be able to do this in a proven, performance, secure way. And not only security, not only operations, but continuous, so that we keep the platform evergreen, the health is guaranteed, we're constantly patched as and when it's needed. And all of this to give platform choice and to drive through the analytics and reporting the risk that you need in this industry. And that is all available from Temenos. Because it's all API-driven, every single piece is fungible, but out of the box, as Colin was talking about, front to back, that's there. It's all wired together through our API-first methodology.</p><p>Running that software together gives you the choice. As I say, the cloud-agnostic piece gives you the choice to run on different platforms. We've added in Ali for the (inaudible) '20 release. And also looking on the cloud-like, on-premise solution where you can take the same containers, the same service architecture and deploy it on-premise in a cloud-like environment. And we've added in support for OpenShift on the OpenShift container platform, and that runs on Z as well as commodity hardware.</p><p>Multi-cloud is great. It gives you the ability to run with the highest-level SLAs. It means you can meet a lot of regulatory compliance issues that you can't do when running on a single cloud. But there is an issue of manageability. So this is where we're looking to solutions like Google's Anthos or VMware's Tanzu, where you can run exactly the same software, single code base, updated, patched, pushed, managed from a central pane of glass and, again, giving our customers the choice of which platform and which solution to go with.</p><p>So in summary, our technology permeates absolutely everything that we do, and it's available on a variety of platforms, which the customers choose. It's available, cloud-native, using the managed services that you'd expect from any well-architected cloud solution. It's cloud agnostic, giving you the choice -- our customers that choice. But also, back to the platform choice for on-prem, we continue to support the traditional applications over deployments but with a look to distributed multi-cloud to be able to run simultaneously, distributed across multi-cloud, active-active. So no DR testing, no downtime because you fail over, the data is there in multiple clouds. And all of that backed by, within the solutions themselves, a loosely coupled, event-driven architecture, which means you can deploy and swap out, upgrade independently any of the components that we've been talking about today.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to bring Prema on the stage to talk about data and AI.</p><p>PREMA VARADHAN, CHIEF PRODUCT ARCHITECT, TEMENOS AG: Hello, everyone. This is the last 10-minute session from product leadership team from -- with a slide deck, particularly. After that, I'll hand over for the demo. So I think it's apt that we wrap up the session -- the product session with data and AI. We talked so much about the feature function, the capability, deepening and broadening with Infinity, Transact, Funds and everything that we do. But no digital transformation is complete in a bank until the bank leverages the insights that they can derive from data, analytics and AI, particularly. You have heard a lot from us before about data and analytics, what we do there. So I'll drill down a little bit in detail on AI, where we are with -- after the Logical Glue acquisition and why explainability of AI model is something we have focused on so deeply. In a regulated industry like ours, explainability is the key. I'll explain a little more on why it is so important and what we are doing about it.</p><p>So the opportunity statements here. Banks are struggling to come up with new use cases that can increase their revenue stream, right? And they have a great opportunity right now to consolidate information about customers, thanks to open banking. There is an opportunity to collect data from other banks about a customer and to understand the financial health of the customer more holistically. But it does give the opportunity for banks to then tailor the products and services that are required by the customers, understanding their needs, understanding their -- the life events and then to be able to cross-sell and upsell. So customer retention, that's absolute key. And doing that in a highly personalized manner, you need AI. You need an explainable AI platform. That's what we try to achieve through our capabilities collectively with data, analytics and AI.</p><p>So how do we do that? It's through 3 of our products. You know Temenos Analytics solution already, Temenos Data Lake solution, and with the Logical Glue acquisition, we also have the explainable AI integrated fully with the complete product set.</p><p>Our value proposition is quite simple and straightforward. It is to enable digital transformation in a smarter way, in a faster manner and also in a cheaper fashion. Smarter, why? Because the customers' behavior is changing. The demands are changing. There is so much pressure for the banks from the industry, from the rest of the challenger banks and the way that the marketplace is opening up. Solutions have to be smarter. They have to be adaptable. They have to be adaptable to the changing needs of the customers. So that's why the solutions have to be smarter, and the smartness comes only when you apply artificial intelligence. It has to be faster, which is what we focus on in training and building these analytical capabilities; understanding the structure of data that comes in, both structured information, unstructured information that comes in from so many channels now and then to be able to derive those insights; understanding the problem that a bank is facing; trying to understand if a customer is about to leave, what should be the next best product to sell to that customer; or a profitability analysis or a risk analysis, right?</p><p>All this is prebuilt with the banking information, banking knowledge, and that is readily available for banks to implement. They don't have to actually do this job, right? We put this together for the banks. And to be able to deploy that at low cost. Tony talked about the technology choices, the platform choices. It's all about simplifying implementation and cutting down the cost of running the software. Cost of change is high. Cost of operations are high. So banks have to do this in a cost-efficient manner. And that's an absolute mandatory requirement these days whenever we build our software. So we make sure any new capability we bring in, any new software that we add to our product set, it's actually built on those principles.</p><p>So this is pretty much how the landscape looks like for us. We suck in all the data from various product sets. We talked about Infinity, Transact, financial crime and fund management. We don't restrict the data sources to Temenos data sources. This is the key point. Because we operate in a very complex landscape, we do understand we have so many other systems within the enterprise that we need to work with, and that has got more valuable information as well. We need to suck all that in. So the Data Lake solution is an agnostic solution in that sense that it's not specific and integrated only with Temenos data sources. It also sucks in data from other data sources within a bank. And it takes care of all of the data requirements. For any bank to run proper analytics, to derive the insights, the data has to be clean. The data has to be purposeful. The data has to become useful before it can be used. And I think when you have a spaghetti-like architecture, when the systems have been grown in-house and aggregated over a period of time by taking off-the-shelf products from so many vendors, it can get really complex to get the right value out of the data, to even get the right data out.</p><p>So this is what Data Lake source, data collection, aggregation of data, cleaning of that data, preparing the data in such a way that the analytics -- analytical models and the AI models can run effectively and to generate insights out. So that's pretty much the whole stack. And we take care of the prebuilt models ourselves, so the banks don't have to build these pipelines themselves, right? Everything from the data models to the adapters to connect to different data sources, to the analytical models, to the AI models, which have been trained, is prepared by us. It's built by us. It's deployed by us. It's supported by us. It can be upgraded by us, right? That's what this is about. That's how we take care of the data requirements, which banks are finding a massive challenge with and also innovating with that data.</p><p>So this is our competitive position on analytics. I won't spend a lot of time on this. The fact that we are the only vendor to have about 100-and-odd different prebuilt analytical models, analyzing customer information, product information, transaction data for retail, corporate, wealth, across segments and then do this analysis for different purposes, risk, profitability, just analyzing the journey, to optimize the use journeys, that's not something we find in the market at all, right? And then to be able to integrate that with the rest of the product set and to deliver these insights that we generate out of the analytics into the right -- at the right places in the -- during the decision-making process, that's our differentiator. For a bank to actually put this all together with off-the-shelf products, it's immensely difficult. I mean none of them have been successful just taking care of a data warehouse project, let alone deriving this kind of insight and embedding that into the places that are required.</p><p>This is our competitive positioning on Data Lake. I think it's very common for people to think that there are so many data warehouses and data lake solutions out there, what can Temenos do that is different to what these people are doing? Can they be more sophisticated? The answer is truly yes. The fact that we are able to collect so much data, not only that, it's about getting the data prepared for use into those analytical and AI models, getting the data models for the banking objects, that is a massively complicated exercise. There is so much banking IP that is required, knowledge that is required to -- that goes into this process, which we have, which we have built already. So that's what -- that's one of the key differentiators for us.</p><p>There are so many banks who are in this data lake transformation journey. They haven't even gone to the stage of actually collecting data from 10 or 15 of their systems, let alone the 400, 500 systems in a big tier 1, tier 2 bank, right? The second problem they face is the quality of the data. They can't actually really get a decent information about their own customers. The data is duplicated. The data sits -- it's fragmented. It sits across so many systems. How can you rely on that kind of information to generate the useful, personalized offering to a customer? Impossible, right? Those are the problems we're trying to solve with the data lake solution, which is prebuilt with our software, right? Massive differentiator.</p><p>With that, I'll get into AI, specifically because that's something relatively new. Why AI is better? Why is our AI better? The characteristics of any AI platform have to have these in mind. One is about personalization because when AI gets involved, we are talking about a self-learning, autonomous way of looking at data and generating insights and to be able to take some decisions automatically and actions. So the platform should have wide-ranging algorithms to take care of different types of predictions, classifications, segmenting information about customers, understanding the behavior of the customers' transaction, right? That is prebuilt in our platform.</p><p>That's what we have been focusing on. Adaptability, the self-learning nature, the way the customer behavior changes, the algorithms also have to adapt to it. That's another key factor. All this is good. But because AI is self-learning, it's not rules based, how do you know that it has not learnt a bias? How do you know that the decisions that it takes are accurate? Trust it -- we can trust it enough to actually run all of this in production. This is the question banks are facing and that's why explainability comes in. I'll explain in a bit about how we do that.</p><p>All of this is done with lots and lots of data. Therefore, the solution has to scale. As banks grow, as their volumes grow, as the channels through which the customers interact with the bank grows and the data point keeps multiplying, the systems have to scale. This is where the technology choices come in. Ours is a cloud-enabled solution. Automatically, we take care of the scalability problem, auto scalability problem. Bank only pays for what they use. They don't have to over-allocate resources for storing data or computing with that data. And the most important factor is, it's okay to have a great platform. A bank can put all this together on their own, but how do they integrate and take these insights and actually embed that into a user journey in a particular retail banking app or provide this information to a call center operator? This is where we come in. Because we have the complete product set which is pre-integrated, embedding these capabilities as part of our platform has given that ability automatically for us.</p><p>So this is what we have been working on, and there is a road map of all the AI models. So we have now an explainable AI platform where all the decisions taken by the AI models, all the output that is generated out of the AI model are fully explainable, explainable in a way that a human user can read and understand why that decision has been derived. Not only that, they can interact with that decision, and they can change or override the decision if needed. This is a key differentiator.</p><p>We have been focusing on credit scoring and improving the efficiency of the FCM decision-making processes as well. There are quite a few other use cases in terms of providing personalization, understanding the lifetime value of a customer, understanding what's the next best product, classifying the transactions, predicting what should be the next -- what could be the next transaction for a customer and then fine-tuning the products and the services that a bank offers to the customer. These are trained by us. And these models are available as packet software, and they are integrated with the distribution services in Infinity. So this is how we provide that type of personalization that Brian was talking about. It's now a feature for us as a standard in Infinity, right?</p><p>Quite a few other models which are in the road map. I won't get into the specifics of it, but you can see it's a very healthy road map. On this one, I just wanted to highlight how the distribution of the AI capabilities look like because it's often easy to think that AI is more to do with just the customer experience and engagement and nothing to do with the back office or the core banking or the manufacturing side of it. Actually, it is not. If I just take an example of the product pricing capability, right, it's -- it can be completely transformed using AI and a data-driven approach. Banks don't often actually look at their products and try and simplify their products. Rarely they do, right? And if products are being treated that way, pricing structures are even worse. They don't even go near the pricing structures because they have a fear of value destruction if they start looking at their pricing structures.</p><p>But treating it in a completely data-driven manner, understanding the customer's lifetime value, understanding the profitability of the products, understanding the overall -- the holistic nature of the financial health of the customer and then coming up with the right products and the services that can be bundled for a specific customer group or a customer itself, that can be path breaking. That's what we are working on. All this requires a lot of information data. So we are working with a number of banks who can provide us with the data and also help us actually fine-tune these use cases, but this is quite transformational. AI in manufacturing can be as effective as personalization on Infinity or front office can be.</p><p>Okay. A little bit on explainability. Why is explainability so important? So as I said, AI is our -- AI model is notorious for being a black box model, right? Because AI model improves as it sees more and more data. It learns from more data that it sees. It's very difficult to understand how that learning has actually influenced the decision-making over a period of time, right? So explain -- without explainability, it's very hard for banks to be able to trust the model with massive decisions like credit scoring or credit underwriting. Banks should be able to explain why they have rejected a loan, why they are accepting a loan and why an AI model came up with that specific score. And this is where explainability comes in, and this is why our unique, patented solution is so much different from what we see in the market.</p><p>Traditionally, the explainability is being -- has been done as an after-the-fact explainability. So a decision has been arrived at, and then based on the outputs and a bunch of inputs that were captured at that point in time, some techniques are available that can explain how potentially this decision or the output could have been achieved. But unfortunately, that's not accurate at all, right? Explainability has to be more intuitive, and it has to be intrinsic. And we use a physiologic-based algorithm, which completely transforms the way we can throw that explainability back at the user and say, \"These are the inputs. These are the factors that resulted in this decision, and this is the weightage the model has given to that decision.\"</p><p>And not only that, we allow the user to actually go and interact with it and change that weightage, change the factor and improve the decision-making and then model learns back from that. So that's why we are uniquely positioned. And we have made the -- done the analysis on explainability with other vendors who claim to do explainability as well. And we have found that some of these techniques are, as I said, not really transparent. They are not fully explainable. It's not fully human readable as well. Most of them are best guess. That's not good enough for a highly regulated industry like ours.</p><p>So I'll leave you with just some value statements. I'm not going to read them out. But there is a significant improvement banks can achieve by applying AI into improving the efficiency and reducing the cost and also providing hyper-personalization that cannot be done in any other manner. So you will see Temenos investing a lot more in this space. You will see us building some of the capabilities through AI-driven solutions and not in a traditional manner.</p><p>So with that, I will hand over to Holger who can show you some demos of our software, particularly on Infinity. Thank you.</p><p>HOLGER LEHMANN, MANAGER OF BUSINESS SOLUTIONS GROUP, TEMENOS AG: So thanks, Prema. I have here my colleague, Ed, with me who will support me in that part of the day where we want to show you 3 different customer use cases that illustrate how customers of ours use our software to actually achieve and overachieve their targets. And we have picked 3 examples that represent different geographies and, above all, completely different types of banks.</p><p>So the first one is Partners Credit Union. And with this, I will hand over to my colleague, Ed.</p><p>ED GROSS, GLOBAL DESIGN CENTER OF EXCELLENCE, TEMENOS AG: Thanks, Holger. So a little bit about Partners Federal Credit Union. So this is a U.S.-based customer. There are about 10,000 financial institutions in the United States. The vast majority of those institutions are small banks and credit unions. Those credit unions serve a very specific market, a very specific membership. Those could be employees of an airline. Those could be construction workers. Those could be very specific to a university, for example, and the list goes on and on. Partners' members all belong -- are all employees of Disney. They're what's called the Disney Cast members. And so these cast members deliver every day these magical experiences to the Disney customers, whether those are audience members, people who go to a Disney theme park, people who are buying Disney merchandise.</p><p>So Partners specifically is a small credit union, $1.8 billion in assets under management. They're charged with delivering to a group of members that have very high expectations in terms of customer experience. However, unlike the big banks, they don't have the budgets of the Chases or the Bank of Americas of the world. So they have to deliver on a much smaller IT budget. Now as Max mentioned, this is where Temenos is uniquely positioned to deliver these tailored experiences.</p><p>What Partners has done is they've taken the Infinity architecture and the Infinity retail banking packaged application and are in the process of delivering a number of other solutions to deliver this tailored experience to their customers. And the way in which they've done this is, they've taken on all the development themselves, and they've released in a very agile fashion to their membership.</p><p>So let's switch over to a live demo now on my device. And before I launch the app, one of the things you'll notice, as I launch it, is they've really kind of put their own little touches into the application, right? So things like animation and a very personalized experience that's based on the geography. So you'll notice, as I launch the app here, we have this nice animation. These are all things that are enabled on the platform as part of Infinity that we build applications on. In this case, this is a native mobile application. One of the next things you'll notice that they very much tailored to their needs, even though they're built on a packaged application, is something called Relationship Rewards. This is a very specific value to their members where they can see their tier of loyalty, for example. In this case, I only have a standard tier, but I can open it up and I can see where I stand in terms of my rewards. So the more assets I have with the credit union, the higher my ranking gets, and I get a lot of benefits, discounts, better percentage rates on some of the financial products that they offer.</p><p>They have all the functionality that one would expect from the Bank of America, and they have to. These credit unions are charged with delivering all the same functionality that a customer would get if they banked with Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, et cetera. So they can do a transfer. They can -- they recently just launched the ability to pay a person. So what the large banks are doing with technologies like Zelle or Venmo, for example, they're able to deliver to their relatively small membership. They also have some unique advertising that's all powered by something that we call campaign management as part of the Infinity platform. This is all focused advertising, very specific and in alignment with the Disney brand, as you can see here. In addition to that, they can make mobile deposits, they can do bill payments, they can message the bank, get FICO scores, obviously, find an ATM, all of the functionality that you would expect from a big banking application, that they're able to, in a very agile way, deliver to their members on a very frequent basis. In fact, since they went live with their latest version in August of last year, they've released 4 to 6 versions of the application very, very quickly.</p><p>If you go back to the slides. So results. So as I mentioned, since they launched their application in August, they went from a 2.2 star rating in the app stores, both iOS and Android, to a 4.6 star rating. So this is a very big deal for a customer -- any customer of Temenos when they launch an application is this drives the level of adoption that you see. So if you have a satisfied customer, less risk of adoption. 80% of all noncash transactions are performed through the digital channel, obviously, reducing operating costs. They had a 16% approximately growth of mobile users in 2019. This is a very big number. And as I'd mentioned, they release very frequently, and they're able to do this because of the Infinity platform, so 4 releases in 4 months. And they've added a lot of functionality with each of those releases. One of the ones that I'd shown is that payments functionality.</p><p>So our next customer is HSBC. Back to Holger.</p><p>HOLGER LEHMANN: Yes. So our next customer, as Ed mentioned, HSBC, completely different type of customer, different size of bank. And HSBC launched a program in 2017 that was aiming towards offering all their products online to their customers. So when launching this program, they had 4 principles in mind that they wanted to see fulfilled. First one was rapid time to market. They wanted a solution that is able to push that plan forward quickly. So that lead it into the next decision. A handcrafted development from scratch is probably not the best solution. So that lead it into the decision for a platform solution that brings out-of-the-box, ready-made capabilities that can be used as an accelerator but, in the same time, provides all the flexibility to make these journeys -- the HSBC journeys as it is required by their guidelines. It also needs an openness to be connected to the FinTech ecosystem, to third-party providers of services. Whenever it comes down to customer origination, customer onboarding, you need integration of fraud detection, you need integration of scoring, you need integration of ID verification.</p><p>And in the end, all of that needs to result in an outstanding customer experience. And customer experience is not only the look and feel of the application. It's not only the graphical design of the screens. It's the behavior of the complete application, how the customer interacts with it, how immediate the feedback of that application is towards the customer.</p><p>So on the next slide, we see here -- my colleague, Ed, volunteered to apply for a credit card. You can see here he's filling out here the application form for that credit card, filling in his personal data: mobile phone number, address and identity information, which is then double checked against the entity or identity provider to see if that is real. In the background, we also run some KYC checks already. We get information back that we can then transform into a questionnaire where we present easy questions to the customer that only the real applicant should know. So that is an additional layer of security within the application process.</p><p>Now that just leads into the third step, we need to gather some information about the employer. About salary information, which is obviously blanked out in this process as it is a real application for my colleague, Ed. And in the last step, you'll then just need to register for online banking, mobile banking, and your application will be processed straight through. So in less than 30 seconds, you will have an approved credit card application. So this part of the process is only 1/2 of the complete solution. The other half of the solution is how can we help banks to iteratively enhance the quality of these processes. How can we make them better? How can we drive a higher adoption rate, a higher conversion rate for their applicants?</p><p>And therefore, we have an embedded journey analytics where you can analyze a given customer journey. And you will see immediately the KPIs: the bounce rate, completion rate, dropout rate. And not only you will see that on an overall origination process level, you will see that drill down into the various screens of that journey. And not only the screens, you can also identify the fields inside a screen that make customers hesitate or drop out. You have the metrics how long they take to answer that question. You have the metrics how many key strokes it takes them to fulfill that answer. You can filter that down further to figure out, are there any differences in between the different device types. Does our application behave differently in the web than on mobile phones?</p><p>Does Android users have more problems than iOS users? You can also drill down into a timeline that gives you, in a monthly drill down, the metrics of that process where you can see how your drop-out ratio, completion ratio develop, and you can then further filter down into, I only want to focus on my conversion rate to be able to see if that is going up or down, which we'll see in this part. And in the last part of that section, you can see the average time it takes users to answer the complete questionnaire and to fulfill the process.</p><p>So how you can make use of that, I will give you an example. One of the first questions in the original version of the application process was an invitation reference number. So HSBC was sending out invitation reference numbers to their clients with the objective that if they enter this reference number, they would come to a prefilled page where all of their data is already filled in. However, it turned out when they looked into the analytics, that 4% of clients dropped out on that field. And that probably resulted in -- they were thinking, I need an invitation code to proceed. As I don't have it, I drop out. But that was not the purpose. But by knowing this information, HSBC was able to simply skip that process, and that results into 4% higher conversion rate. Now 4% may not sound that impressive. But just imagine you can identify 10 of those fields that cost you 4% conversion ratio. I think that is an outstanding result of how you can make use of the embedded journey analytics and how it helps banks to overachieve their targets.</p><p>So with that, HSBC was able to multiply the origination volume, 4 to 5x, and they were even over exceeding their own expectations by more than 50%, resulting into 75% of all applications are processed 100% straight through without any kind of manual intervention.</p><p>And remember, when I said in the beginning, it was very important for HSBC to have a very short time-to-market and a platform that still allows an agile and flexible approach.</p><p>I can give you another example of that. On a Thursday, basically, today, HSBC decided they need to change one of the journeys. They wanted to introduce a new FinTech into that journey to make it more comprehensive and better for their customers. So on Thursday, that idea was born. So we helped the bank to design the new process -- the adopted process to integrate that FinTech provider to prototype the new process, to implement the new process, to test the new process and to go live that new process on Monday. So basically, 4 days, including the weekend, it took HSBC to completely integrate a new process step and to be live with an enhanced version of their credit card journey. And I think that is an outstanding result.</p><p>And with this, we move on to our third example that we want to give you, which is Credit Union of Australia. It's, again, different type of bank, completely different geography. And Credit Union of Australia is, again -- is slightly bigger than partners, but is not one of the dominant players in the Australian banking market. Australian banking market is dominated by 4 major banks, so they had to have a different strategy in mind. They couldn't simply outspend those 4 banks on innovation. They needed to out-innovate those banks, and they came up with a plan to tackle 3 areas that are important for them.</p><p>So the first one is customer onboarding. Second one was customer servicing via a mobile banking application. And third is a new type of personalized customer relationship via chat that they implemented as well. And they have chosen 3 different vendors for that to implement it. And now it happens that all of these vendors are part of the Infinity platform. So basically, they implemented Infinity even before we had it.</p><p>And here, you see the account opening journey. It's a little bit more simple than the HSBC one, and it also comes along with FinTech or third-party integrations. So whilst we are typing here, we can see that there is an address lookup service attached from Mastersoft. So it fulfills the address when you start typing. And on the next screen, we then have, again, integration with identity verification. In this case, we use greenID in Australia to verify the passport data. And when that step is done, you simply need to double check if everything is correct and submit your data to the bank.</p><p>So when you are a customer, what happens next? Next happens that you most likely use your mobile phone to do your daily servicing. And this mobile phone application is actually based on the very same platform as the Partners' mobile phone application on the Kony Quantum technology. And it comes out of the box with a lot of features that help a bank to accelerate the process of go-live, of offering that services to their customers. It starts with accounts and transaction details and ends with Samsung, Google, Apple Pay integration plus, and that will be the last part of the demo, the integration with the unique chat solution. So here, in this part, we will log in with our Face ID. We will see the account overview, and we can drill down into a specific account.</p><p>We see the transaction history, and we decide we want to initiate a payment. And this payment is a third-party person that I can create as a payee on the fly by just entering his account details, I can then use that payee for my payment. In this case, I transfer AUD 10 and review the data, submit it, authorize the transaction with a 2-factor authentication, and now it comes. And then this transaction is being executed in realtime again. So, so far, we have seen standard functionality that is expected. Nowadays, you need to have that as a bank.</p><p>And now we move on into the personalized chat solution. Okay. So here we start. And this is a WhatsApp-type chat embedded in the banking application. And this WhatsApp-type chat allows a customer to initiate a person-to-person communication with an employee in the bank. And the first thing you do is when you log in, you can pick the agent that you like to interact with. And these agents, you typically pick based on your interest, based on the product area you want to select. In this case, we have picked Sarah. So Ed introduces himself and Sarah writes back, and you will be surprised how sticky customers are with their personal agent. 92% of clients would rather wait until their agent is online again before they start chatting with another person. So this is really a person-to-person relationship that builds up based on this technology.</p><p>So basically, Ed here is introducing himself and asking if they have any recommendation for products that could give him a little bit higher interest rate. Sarah comes back with 2 different product recommendations she could do for him. And he decides that he would want to have the product that gives him 2% interest rate, and he would like to invest $90,000 from his savings account. And by just instructing Sarah, my other chat solution, everything else that is required to set up this product can be initiated by Sarah and this is a very, very efficient sales tool. So in the end of the conversation, Ed just says goodbye, and we can move on to the summary screen.</p><p>So by introducing this service, CUA was able to really increase their metrics. So there was a 40% growth in mobile banking adoption by introducing a better mobile banking application. 220% increase in payments via mobile. Out of their customer base, 20,000 customers are active users of the personalized chat solution, we call it Engage, and they're aiming to use -- or to service 50,000 customers in this year. And also, in average, the number of products that customers have is increasing from 1.9 to 3.1 products per person when they are active, engaged chat users. And as you can see here, when you are able with one single agent to outsell 8 branches in a week, that is actually a fantastic return on investment. That is really pushing new boundaries. And whilst I talk about return on investment, I would like to thank you for your attention, and I would like to hand over to my colleague, Kanika, who is introducing the Temenos Value Benchmark.</p><p>KANIKA HOPE, STRATEGIC BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, TEMENOS AG: Thanks, Holger. So all morning, you've been looking at the product offerings that Temenos has for the market. And I'm going to shift the focus a little bit to the tangible business value that these product offerings bring to our clients. And with that in mind, I'll introduce the Temenos Value Benchmark.</p><p>We all know, we've been talking about the disruptive technologies that are having such a profound impact on the industry. They're leading to the twin trends of digital and open banking, and they are changing the very structure and value chain of our industry. What is happening is, as we've been talking about new entrants coming into the market, FinTechs, technology players, but coming in at a cost/income efficiency ratio of 30% or thereabouts, which is an order of magnitude lower than incumbent banks.</p><p>Historically, banks have under-invested in IT. The operative word here is investment. Although banking IT spend at 11% of revenues is significantly higher than other industries, 2/3 of that goes into just keeping the lights on, keeping the systems running or on nondiscretionary regulation. Only 1/3 is spent on true business value add, growth and innovation. Banks are still running legacy systems. They have built a lot of complex modern systems around those legacy. They are hesitant to replace that legacy, not just because of the perceived risk or the business disruption to the business, but because it is very difficult to justify a business case for a multiyear transformation where there are high initial investments and late accruing benefits often many years after the program goes live. Now the disruptive technologies are changing that, but this is a big challenge for banks.</p><p>Finally, banks have not had a great track record of business and IT alignment when it comes to transformation. Historically, a lot of big transformational projects have failed because they were IT driven and were not sufficiently sponsored by the business. This is also changing quite a bit today. Today, most technology transformations are sponsored and driven by the business. So what that means is that in today's world, banks need to understand and have a strategic and very clear view on the value that their investments in technology will bring them in a way that was not as important before. Never before has it been so important to really understand the impact from a cost/benefit perspective of your IT investments. And for Temenos, we need to engage with both the IT and the business leaders at our clients in a way that has reached new proportions. We need to be able to engage with the business and really explain to them what is it that our solutions truly bring.</p><p>Banks struggle even today to answer very basic questions about around their IT investments on the returns they should have, could have and indeed have brought. Senior banking executives today really need to understand the impact of IT to understand how to prioritize their investments, how to think beyond the short term to build 3- to 5-year plans. And they struggle with this. I have personally been involved in a business case where the CFO insisted on only including the operational and IT cost savings, no revenue-related drivers were considered. So the business case that came out was not an accurate picture of what the investment could actually bring.</p><p>With that in mind, we've launched the Temenos Value Benchmark. It is a strategic program whereby we, together with our clients, explore the drivers of business performance. We better understand in banking, what is it that really drives high performance, how does technology enable that performance and how well are banks doing compared with their peers and the best-in-class? Our clients' data is kept completely confidential, as you would imagine, in an exercise of this nature with strict terms and conditions. It's very, very sensitive data. Our clients literally open their books to us. We conduct this very collaboratively on-site, with strategy consultants who interview key stakeholders across the bank. In return, the bank gets a highly customized report with insights, trends, comparisons and recommendations. And we want to build a long-term relationship with our clients. So this is something that we would like to do on a regular basis, go back to the clients, either every year or 2 years or at a significant event in the bank's life, whether it's a merger or whether it's a significant go-live or whether it's a major upgrade.</p><p>As a market-leading provider of mission-critical banking software, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to provide value through this program. We believe that we can help our clients really understand how and why they perform better or worse than their peers, and how they can improve in a more credible way than our competition or indeed, even the strategy houses. Why is that? Firstly, we can capitalize on our 25 years of banking domain experience. All relevant product directors in this room, whom you've heard all morning, have input into the questions. So the collective IP of our organization is reflected in the benchmark.</p><p>Secondly, we have a front-to-back product stack, which covers the entire banking value chain. We have no competing or overlapping products, so our product map totally fits with the banking value chain and allows us to conduct a benchmark from the point of view of the bank very neatly.</p><p>The depth and breadth of our client base, 3,000 banks across the globe, more than 800 running core banking gives us access to a very rich database, much, much richer than our competition. Even the strategy houses struggle to expand benchmark programs beyond the region because the devolved nature of their organization. We provide a truly global perspective with representation from all our regions.</p><p>The methodology that we use is proven in the software industry. It is based on value life cycle methodology of business-led technology transformations around value discovery, value realization and value optimization. It was pioneered by Siebel many, many years ago, later adopted by Oracle, SAP and other ERP providers.</p><p>We are not aware of any other competition launching a similar program so far. We want to capitalize on this first-mover advantage and build a really truly industry-leading program.</p><p>Finally, we've heard about how data is such a competitive asset in today's world for our banks. By providing data-driven insights through this program, we actually walk the talk.</p><p>The benchmark is structured around the banking value chain, not around Temenos solutions. We cover 8 domains. Six of them are part of the core chain, all the way from product management to sales and relationship to payments and to risk and compliance. And there are 2 supporting domains: analytics and IT.</p><p>In each domain, we ask our clients specific questions on quantitative metrics, for instance, time-to-market or payments error rates, but we also ask them to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 5 on the importance and majority of industry best practices. That's where our business domain knowledge comes in. And these qualitative best practices help us to understand why a particular quantitative metric is high or low. So for instance, commercially consolidated watch list in FCM. Is that something that drives false positive rates? Is there a correlation between them? The fact that we have qualitative and quantitative questions allows us to do that analysis.</p><p>We are close to 50 banks in the program so far. And we -- definitely, we've got a lot of momentum with our existing clients as well as with prospects, and we want to double this in the next year or so. I mentioned that this is a truly global benchmark. We have covered many, many countries in all of our regions with adequate and a well-balanced distribution across all of them.</p><p>We cover 3 banking verticals: retail, corporate and wealth. And we end up having very in-depth discussions with very senior stakeholders at our clients at the C-level and C minus 1 level, because we ask them questions, which are truly strategic to them.</p><p>We've collected an enormous amount of data from a statistically significant set of banks, and that has allowed us to generate some very interesting insights. Let me explain and introduce some of them to you.</p><p>This is the banking capability model in the age of digital and open banking that we believe describes the capabilities that a bank needs to differentiate. What we need is true differentiation and customer centricity on the distribution side of things, in the front office, and we need standardization and operational efficiency in the back office or the manufacturing side. And both of these need to be underpinned by analytics and AI.</p><p>Now what the benchmark allows us to do is to really validate this hypothesis. And the numbers that you see here, you can look at them as almost the voice of the customer. So these percentages refer to the percentage of respondents that rated these capabilities very high, either 4 or 5 on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the lowest. So what we find is that 91% of our respondents said that front-to-back digitization and analytics is key. It's highly important for them.</p><p>On the front office side, contextual user experience. Being all knowing, understanding the customers' interactions at every touch point, and consequently, being able to proactively produce personalized propositions and return was rated the highest by 93% of the respondents. 90% of the respondents rated having an adoptive and resilient operating model in the back office as very important. This is all about having in-built self-monitoring and optimizing and [got the] terms at the back in order to optimize your performance. And RPA comes in, in a big way. You'll notice that open banking is relatively low. And that is partly because of the true global nature of our benchmark. And in many markets, it is still nascent. We expect this to really go up as open banking gets adopted in multiple markets around the world.</p><p>What we also find is that our top-performing clients significantly outperform the industry. So on cost/income ratio, the top quartile, the top 25% in our database had a cost/income ratio of 26.8%, which is really about half of the 59% global average across the world. And this is -- the number that I mentioned is also in line with some of the digital challenger banks and the neo banks that are coming in. We already have banks of a very good mix. These are not all-digital banks. This is a very representative sample of different types of banks in our client database that have this cost/income ratio. And similarly, on return on equity, the best-in-class have a return on equity of as high as 29% versus the industry average of 9.5%.</p><p>If we look at how much of their IT spend is on growth and innovation versus keeping the lights on and/or nondiscretionary regulation, we find that our best-in-class, those banks that are the highest performing banks by cost/income ratio spend 51% of their IT spend on true value add compared to the industry average of 27%. We find that this is -- this leads us to the conclusion that Temenos solutions help banks to focus their IT spend on real business value add, and the greater the focus, the higher the performance. So Temenos can really invest in commodities, so that our clients can focus on differentiation.</p><p>Here, we explore the relationship between a bank's financial performance and some of the operational metrics. So what is it that makes a high-performing bank different from the not so high-performing banks? What you see here are 15 operational metrics, they are not a random selection. These are the metrics that positively correlated with either cost/income ratio or return on equity in our sample. So what it tells us is that those banks that had the higher spend on growth and innovation had the lowest loan origination times or the lowest false positive alerts also happened to have the lowest cost/income ratio and/or return on equity. It's a correlation. It's not a causation, but it does tell us what is it that is behind these financial metrics in terms of operational drivers.</p><p>These have been categorized into 5 groups. And these are intuitive, this is what you would expect. Innovation and growth is all about how quickly and cost effectively a bank can launch customer-centric, differentiated products or enter new markets very quickly. Customer centricity is about the omnichannel contextual experience that you can provide, giving greater convenience, relevance, responsiveness and reliability. Operational efficiencies, end-to-end optimization of both operations and IT from the front to the back. Risk and compliance, it's about managing enterprise-wide risk and again, very cost-effectively handling regulatory and reporting obligations. All of this underpinned by analytics. How widely do you use analytics to -- for managerial decision making across your enterprise and help that -- help -- and how that helps you to improve performance. From data, trusted data, both within the bank and outside the bank.</p><p>Let's look at customer centricity in a little more detail. So there were 3 operational metrics: The percentage of digitally active customers, the percentage of front office staff on admin tasks and loan origination times that positively correlated with other cost/income ratio or return on assets. By virtue of this fact, we can say that high-performing banks have the lowest origination times. They engage digitally with more of their customer base, and they have front-office staff that spends more time on business value-add rather than manual back-office admin tasks.</p><p>Then we went further, we said, what drives these operational metrics? What are the business drivers behind some of these metrics? So let's take the example of digitally active customers, and the use of a single rules engine and a single point of integration to channels. If we explore this further, what we find is, that those banks that have the highest percentage of digitally active customers also rate themselves the highest on this capability, the capability of having a single rule engine and how integrated their front-office channels are. This leads us to the conclusion with banks that have siloed channels struggle to engage digitally with more of their customers.</p><p>Afterwards, although the benchmark is totally structured around the value chain, we are able to also analyze the Temenos footprint at this client base, and we've grown an interesting conclusion. One example of that is that those banks that run Transact-only versus the ones that run Transact plus Infinity or any module of Infinity as is our definition here, also fare better on some of these key operational metrics. So onboarding time is significantly lower when you have more of the Temenos stack. Similarly, the customers per FTE almost doubles. And the front-office staff is also significantly lower when you have a front-to-back solution from Temenos.</p><p>What does the client get? They get a 100-page report, very detailed, divided into 3 sections. The first section is really the trends that I just shared with you. But what we do is we plot each bank on the trend, and we give them specific recommendations on their positioning. The second section is on quantitative metrics where we compare key quantitative metrics and ratios to the average, the top quartile and the bottom quartile in our benchmark. The third section is on the qualitative best practices where we compare each bank's importance and maturity against the top quartile, average and bottom quartile.</p><p>Now these reports have been very well received. We have shared them with a number of our clients where we've completed the exercise. I want to particularly cite one example of a CIO, whereby the bank was reasonably good on cost/income ratio versus the benchmark, but they were spending only half the benchmark average on IT. They were also very low on the digital -- on digital -- digitization. And what we found is that he was able to take that report to his Board and get double his IT budget -- approval for double his IT budget and launch a digital transformation program at the bank.</p><p>Another bank, which was a challenger bank, used the report to understand the full value of his IT. He had underestimated the amount that he was spending on IT, he had not included certain FTEs, and he then became very cognizant of the fact that as he was going to scale the bank from a very small base, he needed to watch out for costs. So there were 2 insights, 2 very different banks. One, a very established player, not so digital in an emerging market, and one, a digital neo bank.</p><p>Now I want to talk about the sort of benchmark and how it impacts our own sales and go to market. In that context, we believe that the benchmark is a foundation for value selling across our enterprise. What we do is we build a database with the true metrics derived from our existing client base, clients that are mature on Temenos, that have been running our solution, and we use that to build business cases for prospects.</p><p>Now the main purpose of value selling is to complement and reinforce our already very effective go-to-market strategy with real business impact messaging and to become trusted advisers in addition to just providing the software. It's about improving our credibility as thought leaders in banking. For existing clients, it could unravel new opportunities to sell additional solutions, so cross-sell, but it could also just encourage the client to upgrade or to use our software better, thereby improving the relationship. And for prospects, we build compelling business cases that justify the investment that they are about to embark on.</p><p>Let me give an example of an ROI model and how we would build it. So a typical business case would have benefits from Temenos, the cost of the project and any other dependencies on the bank. The benefits from Temenos, we can derive directly from the operational and financial metrics that we collect from the benchmark exercise from the database. And we are able to provide very tangible numbers strongly justifiable because of the correlating best practices. These are essentially evidence of how our solutions enable the business and justify the financial benefits. So this benchmark makes it easy for us to build business cases that are not assumption-based, but evidence-based. Thank you.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Thanks very much, Kanika. Great. We're now going to break for lunch. If I can ask everyone to be back in the room by 1:30, please, for the afternoon session. Thanks very much.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Good afternoon. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome back. I'd like to introduce our next speaker, Alexa Guenoun. She's very recently been appointed President of the Americas and Global Head of Partners. For the first time in a Temenos Capital Markets Day, she's joining us live from the U.S. in the thick of the action. So I'll hand straight over to Alexa, who's going to be in one of the screens there.</p><p>ALEXA GUENOUN, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAS AND GLOBAL HEAD OF PARTNERS &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, TEMENOS AG: Hi, I hope everybody can hear me well. Good afternoon for you. I guess it's after lunch. It's great for me to be back here, actually in the U.S. except for remembering that you need to be up early, so I'm still on morning coffee on my side. But yes, been here, probably about 15 years ago, so it's really, really great to be back and back in this market. And I'm talking to you from Malvern, our headquarter, headquarter for the U.S.</p><p>Hopefully, you'll be able to hear everything now I want to say about this great opportunity that we have for Temenos in the U.S.</p><p>So really, if we look at where we are today and our growing presence, I mean there's no -- our strategy has always been very clear. We've always -- we've had a historical presence, but we've grown through acquisition. It is a market we cannot afford not to be in, obviously. So with the second acquisition we've had recently, I would say, the last year, 1.5 years, most significantly, Kony and Avoka, we now have about 700 people just in the U.S. So locally, it's about 50% more than we used to have just in 1 year, thanks to Kony acquisition last year. We are operating about -- in about 7 major offices. So that's where our people are based, that's where we run the business. And overall, the combined client base now is actually quite significant at over 1,300 clients. Obviously, there's always, as you would imagine, flagship clients that use different part of our portfolios, Citibank is one of them. Varo and Grasshopper on the digital front, obviously, also Credit Unions.</p><p>Regions, you have Commerce Bank that everybody's heard about. Again, a big core client for us. Everybody's watching us, too, as well. So really, today, for us, this is a big presence. This is a large footprint. And that's why we are invested there to make sure that we can capitalize on the opportunity. Because the opportunity itself is actually quite significant. By every measure and every research you can make, you obviously know that it is the largest market for us. Almost half of the asset under management globally are based in the U.S. So again, very significant. And if we look at third-party software spend, again, the largest market, 2019 we were about 42%. 2020, we assume it will be at 50%. So definitely not something we can pass. 10,000 institutions in the market. So a large, large play that we need to be in, and it's very attractive. It's something that we want to be part of.</p><p>That wouldn't be enough though. I mean we have a lot of market, and we have some large markets, obviously, historically, Europe. It has to be sustained by strong drivers for us to be interested, obviously, and to make a play in that market. And they are very strong drivers that we see in the U.S., some of them are specific to the market, other are quite close to what we see elsewhere. But what we see really is around 5 drivers that will impact what we can basically drive out of this market. The first one is around deposits. We know that all the banks now are trying to protect a deposit, share of wallet. So obviously, protecting customer acquisition and increasing this. Making money for them is becoming very challenging. So the pressure really is to grow -- is on growing deposits, and growing deposits at a lower cost, obviously, is that also something that everybody is very mindful of is in this day and age</p><p>What we also see, which plays very well to terminal strength is the new entrants, the new competition, especially the digital-first competition. In that space, everybody wants to play. I mean Europe has been at it for a while with the likes of N26 and Monzo and Raisin. But in the U.S., there's a lot of initiatives you've all heard of Chime, you've all heard of Simple, you've all heard of Moven. We've seen the big players thinking that they also need to play in that space. So Marcus, everybody's heard of it and [go manually add it] , and Marcus are actually quite successful. So really, when it comes to digital first, it is a very, very big play now. Fintechs are also going at it. They have a slightly different view on how they're doing it. They're focused on distribution, obviously, and they usually are backed by incumbent bank or smaller banks. But they don't usually do the manufacturing themselves. They focus on distribution. However, they're big players in the market.</p><p>There's obviously [launch] every year, everywhere, every market, a complex regulatory environment, U.S. is no exception. It's actually probably even more complex because of the state regulation as well. So the layers of regulation is actually quite heavy. It has changed though. People are -- regulators especially are less interested these days in globalization. They're more interested in the trade tensions that we're seeing everywhere and how they're going to regulate this. Also on their agenda now, which we didn't really use to see before, are technological changes. They used to be an enabler. Now they are a concern for regulators. So it's actually slightly different. And then, obviously, like in every domain, the social concerns, including the environmental concerns, the environmental sustainability. All of these are challenges that are not only now facing our day-to-day life, but the regulators are very concerned, and they are making sure that their financial sector gets concerned with this. So obviously, the financial services firms have to get ready for this.</p><p>The other 2 are more classic. We've been at it for quite a while, but it's still there, and it's still there on every market, it's very present in the U.S. The cost -- the pressure on costs, everybody needs to find a way to operate cheaper, everyone needs to find a way while they still need to be compliant, they'll be -- a big cost for them on the regulation. They need to still find a way to spend less, spend better, increase -- better their cost-to-income ratio. So all of these things are still in play as well as their pressure on interest rates. So all of these really are challenges that we see in the U.S. But they are actually for us, very, very strong driver. So yes, the size of the market is important for us to think we need to be there, but it is sustained by quite strong drivers that we can explode and we have solutions to when it comes to offering solutions to the financial institutions in the U.S. At the helm of this, obviously, is the digital opportunity.</p><p>All of those challenges, whichever way banks are trying to address them. Most of them start from the digital front office. What should they do in the front office first. And most significantly, really, how do they address those challenges through the digital play. So for us, obviously, the answer was Infinity, which we announced last year, and how to increase the speed to market of Infinity, our answer was Kony.</p><p>So we realized that, that would give really 2 things. First of all, increase our time to market on the product front and obviously increase our presence in the U.S. specifically. So on the product, really, with this being a global leader, we got a SaaS digital offering that is readymade -- that is at the heart of how this company used to operate. So again, goes played well to our driver growth around SaaS that you have seen earlier. The platform itself is an award-winning platform. It's well recognized in the industry, sold the banking experience platform, the multi-experience development platform as well complement our Infinity agenda. So really combining this with Infinity and Avoka, we get a superior offering for Infinity and we get it fast. So that's time to market.</p><p>The local development platform, something that, again, is very, very unique, very, very useful for CIOs and CTOS. And again, we talk time to market for them and for us, it's a very good play.</p><p>Finally, obviously, it's very, very functionally rich. It has the right technology underpinning it. So again on the product side, it's really been a leapfrog for us, it's really helped us in that front. And obviously, it's a U.S. player, it's the largest digital player in the U.S. So that comes with the U.S.-centric product. So yes, Infinity will be complemented by Kony globally and it helps globally our portfolio. But in the U.S., again, if I talk about leapfrog and jumpstart, we got it with Kony because their excess solution is tailored for the market from the get-go. It comes with 50 U.S. clients, especially good traction on the other tiers. So again, where we play very well.</p><p>Knowledgeable people, knowledgeable people not only about the solution and technology, but the U.S. market, and a lot of cross-selling opportunity for us. So overall, that was one of our key way in and key reason for doing this acquisition and really thinking this is going to strengthen significantly our U.S. offering and U.S. presence.</p><p>However, I mean, when we talk about this, yes, there is a specific for the U.S. and the narrative is different, the CIOs and CTOs have a different view of addressing their stack and their technology. We hear a lot, which we are hear less in the rest of the world, we hear a lot about system of engagement, systems of record, systems of insight. But if you look at it compared to what you've probably heard in this morning, you heard probably a lot about distribution and manufacturing. And really, while this vision of the world, of the IT landscape in the U.S. is, is no different. You pretty much have system of insights sitting in the middle. But in a way, and by and large, it is not a stretch for our offering as this is what we're doing globally. It is just a slightly different presentation. And obviously, some specific, I wouldn't say, customization, but market-specific features that we got from our market presence. So on that, really, we can capitalize on the 1,300 institution that we have in the U.S. that are live and which have one part only [offer of the] portfolio that we can then start cross-selling to.</p><p>Of course, I mean, for us, that's probably not enough. We talked a lot about capitalizing the digital opportunity. And that's why we felt that we need to complement and enhance the offering in the U.S. with a specific and targeted offering for that market. That's why we launched about a month ago our U.S. SaaS offering. So it's really a dedicated offering for digital banks; front to back; out of the box; continuously deployed, meaning, continuously enriched and enhanced for banks who want to get into that market, want to get into that market quickly. It can be banks, it can be new entrants, it can be FinTech. But the idea really is to say, in 90 days, you have a bank up and running. You have a front-to-back solution, up and running, continuously deployed. You can then start servicing and entering and benefiting the market. As I said, really relevant to the play around the new digital entrants, specifically around deposits. I think all the banks that are starting up these days are only starting from 2 angles, deposits or loans, it's pretty much what we see. It's not super sophisticated in terms of what kind of product they're offering. But the key is time to market, quickly getting those deposits.</p><p>So we've seen a lot of interest in the U.S., we launched that on year, year -- sorry, a month ago and there's really a lot of interest. We had a lot of inquiries. Interestingly enough, obviously, which is a good proof point for us from the Kony clients, from all the Akcelerant clients as well. So all the clients that are at that end of the market where they're thinking I need to do something else, but also a lot from the big ones who are thinking we need to get into that market. So very encouraging for us.</p><p>In terms of how we're planning to go-to-market in the U.S., obviously, it is quite different from what we see in other markets. I mean the structure of the market is really based on tier and the size of the organization. You have a very, very fragmented market, a very large market, over 10,000 institutions. And the behaviors, the spending patterns, engagement is different from every tier you go to. I mean, the majors, obviously, the big ones, the clients, the Regions which are clients of ours, for example, they operate within their boundaries. They have different business segments. They have different things we could talk to them about, and they are closer to what we see traditionally. The nationals, again, quite a large client base for us. You've all heard about commerce, you've all heard about sterling national banks, Ally. Again, slightly different, what you will equate to a Tier 2. Closer to major, I would have to say, but again, less business segment-driven, more global in the U.S., so a very different play for us as well.</p><p>The regional, there you have a mix of credit unions and banks. They are often community banks serving a particular community in a location or an affiliation. So again, very specific in terms of the market they serve and the customers they serve, but usually not very broad in terms of what they do. In that space as well, we do have quite a lot of clients, partners. One of them with this, I don't know if you might know, that it is the Credit Union for the Disney employees. So all the Disney employees today are [served] by us, which is quite fun, if you look at it this way. The first -- the techs as well. If you look at First Tech Federal Credit Union, that's the bank for the Silicon Valley employees. So in there, lots of LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft employees, very trendy. But again, at the place where it's very specific in what they do, it's very narrow. It's a different -- again, a different market for us. The digital banks we talk about, I mean we talk about [the plans]. Whether you're talking new entrants, whether you're talking affinity banks or are you talking big banks, large -- majors wanting to launch new brands and attack a new market, for us, again, a different play, a different way of going at it.</p><p>And then the funds and wealth segments. In the U.S., we have half of the world's AUM sitting in the market. So a place where we have offerings, a place where we are well positioned to attack the market and quite significant for us to go after. So in terms of how we're going to work, it's really about tiering the market and finding which are the right solution to offers. We know that our solution are diverse, we have the large portfolio, we have 5 drivers of growth. Some of them apply to all segments, others don't. And we need to be focused. We need to understand what to offer. I mean, with 10,000 institutions, quite frankly, you need to know what you're going to attack where and which solution you're going to deploy. So obviously, the majors we know there's a play around Infinity, of course. There's a play around the core. There's a play around the -- anything to do with the analytics as well.</p><p>If you look at the nationals, pretty much everything is of interest, not funds. That's not something they do. On the regional, it's really going to be centered around Infinity and cloud. That's what they're interested in, that's the entry point. They might then move into looking at Transact and the back, but the entry for us is going to be through the Infinity platform and the cloud.</p><p>The digital bank, a bit of everything. As we know, our solution, anyway, the way it's been built, it's on cloud, so that's one tick. It has front-to-back and analytics. So pretty much everything is in there. Payments obviously underpins all of our core banking platforms.</p><p>Wealth sector in that front, it's Infinity because Infinity covers the wealth, so it's Infinity from the front office point of view. Whether it's for wealth managers or for fund administrator, the platform we can give to them on the fund side as well as our dedicating offering for the fund side with Multifonds. So if you look at this, really, we are actually quite clear on how we going to attack which segments. However, one thing is also very clear, and I'm sure you heard that before, we can't just go ahead with a big bang deployment. So all of this is going to be underpinned on our side with how we're going to distribute and deliver those solutions to them.</p><p>So micro services are key, especially in the high (inaudible) tiers, the majors, they're not going to do a full core banking replacement big bang. Every product line in one go. We need to be able to offer distribution services to them. We need to offer different Transact services on -- also so that they can start plugging and unplugging the legacy. So that's something that we're going to have to pick and choose for every single segment, but we have the portfolio. The good thing for me, getting back into this market, is really the offering. Because yes, it is what we have globally and Temenos is like that. We deploy globally our solutions. We don't really do specific. However, with our presence in the U.S., with the (inaudible) acquisition, and now, through the microservices, we have a different way of going after the market that is probably more suited to the way the CIOs and the CTOs in this market operate.</p><p>A good proof point -- I don't know if you've been reading the American Banker this week. But there was a very good article, we're very proud of this, on Varo. Varo has been one of our very early adopter. They have been a partner of ours from the beginning. And actually we tested pretty much our model bank, our U.S. model bank, which is at the heart of our SaaS offering, we tested that with them because they're using Transact on the cloud, they're using lifecycle management, they're also using payments. So really everything within our portfolio that we are actually putting on the SaaS model, they've been using. They've been piloting with us. They have been steering us in the right direction. And what better proof than having the FDIC say you're good to go? You are now able to get your charter, you can launch your operations. So for us, it's been a great week, I'd have to say. I mean we've been working with them for a while and getting this on the newspaper is actually proof point for us, that what we have can be deployed, can be approved, is actually state of the art. I mean if you look at what Varo is going to do with [it's suite]. So quite frankly, all the work that's happened and all the acquisitions have actually paid off and it's a good launchpad for us.</p><p>So if I summarize, really, where we are now, it's all about scale. We know that in the U.S., the market is there in terms of scale. The offering -- our offering is there in terms of scale. We do have our 5 engine of growth, they're all relevant. We have a great partner network. I mean we've been working with the partners in the region for a while with Cognizant to Deloitte for the deployment. But now a new -- Max has talked about it. We are actually focusing also on the big tech companies to make sure that we leverage as well the distribution network and their sales force. So complementing this with our own sales force, which has actually grown significantly, we've added 25 headcounts in the U.S. just in sales. We went from 49 to -- from 44, sorry, to 69. So if you look at this, we do have everything to succeed in the U.S. We have the product. We have the scale of the organization. We have the partner network. We just need to go engage. I think it's starting. It's starting big. We've done quite a lot of very nice customer acquisition over the last 2 to 3 years. And I think we have now the next wave ahead of us, and I'm actually very excited to be leading this.</p><p>So hope to share more of you, and I'll be talking to you more also on what we see coming here. Adam?</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Thank you very much, Alexa. Thank you. Very glad that, that went fine in terms of technology as well. Filing in from the U.S. is not necessarily easy. I'm now going to hand over to Takis, who's going to cover the section on creating shareholder value.</p><p>PANAGIOTIS SPILIOPOULOS, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, TEMENOS AG: Yes. Welcome to this afternoon session. As usual, we're not going to talk about Q4 results. We did this yesterday. We have given an outlook for 2020. I think we're convinced we can deliver on those. So this is more about taking, first, a look back, but then also give you some of the background required, why you believe this is an exciting story, not just for 2020 but for the midterm and the long term.</p><p>So if we look at the basics, I think this is good, classic, strong business model based on software, packaged software, continuous investment into R&amp;D, and put that back all into software, make it available to all the clients and, therefore, building this very strong business model. It has delivered, as we heard from Max, 25% total software license growth CAGR over the last couple of years. It is 64% of total shareholder return over the same period. And I think that's something, it's a testimony to the strength of the team, to the strength of the ecosystem, but also the strength of our culture, as Max pointed out.</p><p>Now if we take a look at the revenue KPIs over the last couple of years, you've seen the 25% already, but if you look at recurring revenues, and this is, I think, important for the investor community, that the growth here is also building. And this is basically locked in -- or a large part is basically locked in profit. So it gives you the visibility and it gives us also the confidence that this business model is also working in the future.</p><p>We touched upon SaaS revenues in more detail today, 53%, and you see a massive acceleration. Yes, there was also M&amp;A included. But definitely, this is for us. And Max mentioned or quoted this, a tectonic shift. I'm going to talk about this. This is really a step change. And this is really something we believe will going to be more important going forward. And the good thing about it, it's incremental. So far, we're not seeing or a very minimal impact in terms of cannibalization. So it's still on top of a strong license business model which we project for the future.</p><p>Now just delivering growth, and there are many companies out there in the U.S. or many software companies which can deliver growth, but they lack the other ingredients for what we believe is the perfect business model in the software industry. You also need to deliver profitable growth, and you also need to deliver cash. We're going to talk about this.</p><p>So here, you see actually that, over the last couple of years, the margin expanded an average of 100 basis points. And I think that makes sense about there to see for the next couple of years for the medium term. This is what we believe is possible. Maybe in a year, a bit less if we do M&amp;A or invest in sales and marketing and maybe a bit more in another year. I think that's a good average.</p><p>What is also important is to see that EPS growth was basically at the same pace. So whatever we do is not diluting to shareholders. And I think that's very important. So M&amp;A is always prudent and not dilutive in the midterm.</p><p>Looking now at cash flow. And we talked about the small bump we had last year at the end. But overall, this is tracking very well. So it's not just delivering growth and profit. It's also delivering cash and this will continue. And we believe it's also a testimony to the hard work of the team out there and we believe we're doing more with Tier 1 to 2 banks, obtaining even better payment terms than we have today, bringing more of the services to partners, as we have already seen, and especially having a larger contribution from SaaS will help us increase operating cash flow and get DSOs down to, I think, 90 days will be an appropriate level. We're going to talk about this in a minute.</p><p>What about capital allocation? Now you can be wasting shareholders' money. We definitely have proven not to be in that category. If we look at the last 5 years, there was a $1.2 billion we spent on acquisitions, on accretive acquisitions and returned $800 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And this is all driven by a strong free cash flow generation we have just seen.</p><p>Also dividends, while we're not a dividend stock, still in the last 5 years, the dividend has more than doubled $0.40 to a proposed $0.85 per share to be paid out after the AGM, if approved. But still, we maintain a very disciplined approach to cash. So we're targeting to basically go back towards 1.5x net debt to EBITDA as a leverage from today, 2.6x by the end of 2020. And I think with our strong cash flow profile, that is a very feasible target.</p><p>Now you heard from Max this morning and basically from the entire team, we touched upon the 3 acquisitions done last year which added a tremendous technology portfolio, but also a lot of talented people, global clients and also scale, in general. So I think this is -- this has been a very good year in terms of the different areas we'll going to be focusing also in the future. Data, AI, analytics, as we heard from Prema, is an important driver. The Infinity portfolio will remain a significant focus of ours. But overall, we always stay very disciplined in our approach to M&amp;A. I think that's important for you as shareholders that we are very responsible in what we do with the capital.</p><p>And the pace. If you look at the last 1, 5, 10 years, okay, the NASDAQ beat us by a margin. Last year, we had a small blip in Q3. But then basically, the share price took pace again. This is adjusted for FX and believe is a testimony to the strength of the business model and also to shareholders seeing the value a true software business model can generate, i.e., packaged software, upgradable software, investing in R&amp;D, widening the gap to competition and expanding the #1 leadership position.</p><p>So some very big numbers. I think outside of -- if you were to compare the big tech giants to that, I think with the exception of Netflix and Amazon, we will be up there with the best. That's, I think, a good testimony.</p><p>So what is going to drive growth in the future? Now we heard about technology being a cornerstone. We heard about the broad product portfolio. We heard about the U.S. opportunity just a minute ago from Alexa. So overall, those engines of growth are firmly in place and the market remains very attractive and continues to grow.</p><p>And if we look at the small box on the right-hand side, we talk about $14 billion growing to $16 billion by 2022. So still third-party spend at those 8%. But the addressable market as a whole is also growing. So it's not just one dimension, it's basically moving in 2 dimensions.</p><p>So for us, we're important. As we've seen, Infinity and Transact being the largest ones. But also payments and the other product offering, a very attractive growth profile.</p><p>Now what we have done in the past, and these are some of the milestones reached in the last couple of years, the addressable market has expanded by a factor of 6 in the last 10 years. We added payments. We added fund administration, that was 2015 with the Multifonds acquisitions. Then we added origination capabilities. There was Avoka, for example. So this is still what we believe the right way to address this large opportunity. So again, growing in 2 dimensions. One is the market itself is growing. But then also carving out a bigger piece for us, which we can address with our product portfolio.</p><p>Now there has been a lot of debate in the last couple of years. Yes, what about Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients? I think this is a clear testimony to Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks doing more with us. If you look back 5 years, it was around 26%, and the other tiers contributing the rest. Last year, it was 43%. It always can fluctuate between years, depending on the number of Tier 1 deals you have. But we still believe those wallets at banks are still best, and we have everything in place to address those wallets. So we believe, in the medium term, this should be maybe around 45% to 55%. I think that's the right value. On the one hand, we're seeing Infinity also being something large banks are looking at. On the other hand, with very, very fast adoption of SaaS and cloud, especially by smaller banks, this is a bit of an offsetting effect. So 45% to 55%, I think, is probably the right number in terms of a medium-term target. And medium term, in that context, is always about 3 to 5 years.</p><p>Now North America, we heard this opportunity from Alexa just before. Again, showing very good development, also helped partially by M&amp;A. But I think we have been winning reference customers in the last 5 years. And with more and more of those going live, we just saw Varo as an example. There's going to be larger ones going live this year. I think it's a huge opportunity for us because once -- the difficult part is building a reference space, building a localized product, and we have that in place. And that's why we believe there is going to be an even stronger acceleration of our U.S. business. So we're very confident that the U.S. business, or North America as a whole, will grow faster than the rest of the world, also in the future. And I think 35% to 40% is probably the right number in terms of what we see based on our current forecast as a medium-term share.</p><p>Now we talk a lot about SaaS metrics, and you've seen some of the slides that are in TCV on an annual base. As you've seen, a forecast on ACV now for the upcoming period, i.e., we are expecting ACV to at least double for 2020 based on the $21 million we have achieved in 2019. So exceptional growth across all those SaaS metrics. And this is why we're showing this is, on the one hand, help you with the modeling and why we're so confident that this SaaS business will continue to grow tremendously, but also to underline our conviction that we can achieve with more and more SaaS business, providing very good visibility that we can achieve our 15% total software licensing growth in the long term.</p><p>So you've seen those, and I'm not going to go into more details. I think it's really a shift in growth acceleration. We've never have weakness before and pretty massive. Yes, there is M&amp;A involved for both time periods, but we believe this is something we'll be closely watching. It's really a tectonic shift, and we believe, and that's the important message here. It's not one or the other. I think we'll going to continue to grow license bookings at a very strong pace and even stronger on the ACV side.</p><p>And specifically, if you look at it more on a short-term basis, and this is just 2019 versus 2020, so the bookings growth on ACV is set to accelerate even further. It was already more than 4x if you take the run rate for Q4 '19. And it's going to be even faster if we look at current forecast for 2020. So an acceleration here and a multiple of 5x, I think it's very, very attractive for shareholders. And I think we have everything in place. The product, but also the organization, the partners to deliver on this one.</p><p>If you look at this from a long-term perspective, and we did a lot of number crunching to see whether this contribution or what the contribution to overall total software licensing growth of SaaS will be. And you look at the slide, and we started at 5%. 2019, obviously also helped by M&amp;A. But we believe more than 60% of our growth in total software licensing will already be coming from SaaS. And if you look at the size difference, you can imagine what kind of growth rate we're seeing here.</p><p>In the long term, and this is the left chart. We believe SaaS should be anywhere between 35% and 40% of total software licensing. So really a massive volume. And the good thing about this, this is not dilutive to margins. And why not? We're still relatively small versus the size of the company, what we do in SaaS, so there is still a lot of operating leverage coming from improving our SaaS offering and really scaling that. So it's growing as a percentage. It's growing in absolute terms, but it's also growing in terms of profit contribution.</p><p>Now we had this discussion internally. And I thought, okay, let's try to show how we build those models internally and to basically give you some of the building blocks which are the bases, which are the pillars for achieving our mid-term growth or long-term growth and our EBIT target. On the left-hand side, this is more the regional split and probably not much of a surprise. But even Europe, which is our largest region, we see a lot of opportunity there across all products. North America, coming from a lower base, also helped by M&amp;A, definitely helping. But also the other regions, APAC, which had a strong year in 2020. So it's broad based, it's not just we're betting the company and the growth just on one region.</p><p>If you look at how do we get to the 36% in the medium term, I mentioned already the operating leverage and the SaaS growth, which is profitable growth, yes SaaS has still lower margin than our license business. But this is improving fast, thanks to Colin and his team. Maintenance, as you know, a software company, this is an important driver. That's basically pure profit, what we have in terms of maintenance growth, which would remain double-digit. And then services, yes, we're offloading more and more to partners, which makes it more profitable. But even without that, I think we have still some optimization potential.</p><p>And then the other cost lines, we're leveraging G&amp;A and also R&amp;D a bit. Definitely continue to invest in sales and marketing because we see this as a really important element to deliver the kind of growth we're expecting.</p><p>Looking at cash. What are the building blocks on this one. On the left-hand side, first, for the operating cash flow performance, definitely profitability is one thing. That's pretty straightforward. But we also see the growth in SaaS and maintenance revenue obviously boosting deferred revenues, and this is a material contributor as well. And then finally, yes, there is some way to go on DSOs, partly offset by payable days, but this should get us to operating cash flow growth, which is obviously at least in line with what we expect for EBIT growth.</p><p>On the DSOs, 120 as a starting point. I think we can definitely improve or still improve our terms on our license business. The SaaS mix will help tremendously. And as I just mentioned, services DSO, some regions are very well advanced and optimized. Others, we still have a bit more headroom to improve to get to the 90 days in the next 3 to 5 years.</p><p>Now M&amp;A. We did the backward-looking view. Going forward, I think it's still the same strategy. As Max pointed out, we want basically M&amp;A to accelerate our organic growth. That can happen through various areas or pillars. Yes, we can accelerate our R&amp;D road map. And basically, gain access in key markets and new segments or expand our position as we did with Kony, increase scale that was also partially covered by Kony, especially in the U.S., adjacent markets and complementary products. I often get the question, \"Would you go back into capital markets?\" I think we can clearly say this is, right now, definitely not a priority. We do not want to dilute our growth. I think that has been also a message by the shareholders, that they want to have somebody, a pure-play in banking, delivering consistently on this growth target.</p><p>Okay. So 6 minutes to go. Let me get to the growth targets. We confirmed the long-term target this morning. As you can read in the press release, maintain the at least 15% total software licensing growth, 10% to 15% CAGR on total revenue growth, the EPS growth of at least 15%, tax rate and cash conversion. What we did on the medium-term targets was we basically brought forward the EBIT margin. That was a long-term target, 36%. We pulled this forward for the next 3 to 5 years. If it's 3 years, it's an average of 130 basis points. If it's 5 years, it's an average of 70, 80 basis points. Now obviously, we have the ambition to achieve this in 3 years. However, we're not going to do something which is not smart in terms of the organic growth. If we have the opportunity to invest in sales and marketing, to accelerate organic growth, we definitely will do this. DSOs, as I mentioned, 90 days. We should get there before the 5-year period. And tax rate, we're not yet running out of deferred tax assets, but I think this is something which will slowly creep in and push our tax rate a bit higher.</p><p>Okay. I think that's it from my side. With that, I conclude. I think that was helpful to build your models and get the DCF values up there. And with that, I hand over to Kalliopi. Thank you.</p><p>KALLIOPI CHIOTI, DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY &amp; SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, TEMENOS AG: Hello to all of you. We're going to talk about corporate social responsibility a little bit different from what you've been listening the whole day. So we, at Temenos, we rely on 8,000 people of 90 nationalities in 68 offices in 40 countries in client sites and from everywhere to deliver value to all our shareholders.</p><p>So let me briefly give you a little bit of background in the kind of environment we are operating in right now. I'm pretty sure that last summer, we saw, at the business roundtable, the CEOs of 200 of the most prominent U.S. companies updated the purpose for corporations in order to include the interest of suppliers, clients, employees and the local communities at the same level as those of the shareholders. At the same time, a few days ago, we heard the CEO of State Street saying that ESG is going -- is not going to be optional anymore. A couple of years ago, we all heard BlackRock CEO saying that sustainability is going to be in the center of its strategy.</p><p>So at the same time, we see a lot of teenage world-change-makers to be sitting on the same table as CEOs in big events like the United Nations or the World Economic Forum event. At the same time, we're also witnessing a lot of adverse environmental and public health events that are actually changing the way we live on a daily basis in the way that companies are operating globally. I could name a lot of other examples of that sort. At the end of the day, what we're seeing is that sustainability is becoming mainstream. It's going upwards on the corporate agenda, and it's affecting the way companies are working, are planning and operating.</p><p>So Temenos has been operating with integrity and responsibility for over 25 years. So our goal is to grow our business in a way that takes care of the world around us, delivering value to anyone associated with us. And how we do that? We do not just simply have a CSR strategy as an add-on. What we do is we incorporate sustainability to the way we operate, promoting a more sustainable business model. So our sustainable business model actually helps us create value for all our shareholders with a positive impact on our business model. At the same time, it helps us manage risk with a positive impact on our operations.</p><p>And at the same time, it helps us give back to the local communities with a positive impact on society. So -- and we do that because we have commitment from the top. And we have our CEO, Max discussed it -- mentioned it in his presentation. We have our CEO, Max, chairing the CSR and Ethics Committee and driving the sustainability agenda in the company. At the same time, we have Board oversight of the CSR and ethics framework. So this is something that goes beyond regulatory requirements. This is something we do on our own initiative.</p><p>And our ESG strategy focuses on 3 priority areas: ethical governance, environment and society. So let me briefly start -- let me give you a couple of examples, I don't want to get into too much detail. Ethical business conduct and governance, we have a 97% compliance with our business code of conduct and mandatory trainings. At the same time, we also do responsible procurement, meaning that we risk assess in all our new and also existing suppliers based on environmental and social criteria. At the same time, information security, the data privacy and resilience are a material issue for our company, meaning that we are delivering secure products that comply with global international standards.</p><p>On the environment side, environmental management, we have rolled out a global environment management system, which is either certified in our offices globally, covering, so far, 60% of the total Temenos population. At the same time, we're also looking into climate change and carbon, which is something really important to us. We measure our carbon footprint. We also reduce as much as possible and offset our business travel, which is our biggest environmental impact. And at the same time, we organize sustainable and carbon-neutral events, just to name, Temenos -- TCF , Temenos Community Forum as well as Temenos KickOff.</p><p>On the society part -- on the social part, what we are doing is we're focusing on something that we know really well, and this is part of our mission, is how to actually help young children and especially kids in India, which is a very material location for us since more than 55% of our Temenos population is based in India, to help them gain digital skills and help them become -- have a better future for themselves and their families and their communities. So how we do that? We have so far built 5 computer labs, solar-powered computer labs, in 5 government schools in great need in India. At the same time, we have built girls restrooms because we would like to help girls have equal opportunities with boys in life.</p><p>But we didn't stop there because innovation is part of our DNA. We created an innovation -- a Temenos innovation lab in one of the leading universities in India, College of Engineering. And at the same time, we have initiated a program where, for the coming years, we're going to provide scholarships to College of Engineering students, second, third and fourth year students. And also, we're going to promote a new initiative of how to encourage more girls, more women to study engineering, to study IT and then have a career in IT. At the same time, we are going to provide them with job opportunities at Temenos, and this is -- because digital skills is something really close to our mission.</p><p>On the gender diversity and equal opportunity front, we have been -- we are very proud of being 8% above the average, we have average women in the IT sector. So we have been -- for the past 6 years, we have been following a diversity strategy -- a gender diversity strategy. And we can actually say that at this point, we have targeted young women getting into Temenos and encouraging women as a -- young woman to get into an IT career. And right now, we're at this 47% of women in Temenos, young women under 30 years old. And at the same time, we're also targeting senior women -- advancement of senior women in senior positions, and we can say that we are at 45% of female are senior management -- managers reporting to the CEO.</p><p>And last but not least, we're focusing a lot on giving back to the community through our people, through our expertise and also through our time of our people. So we have been, for a year to 2019, we have had 800 unique and returning volunteers, offering 1,400 hours doing community service, mainly in the schools and at the university in India, but also globally. And following also the London benchmarking group model, we monetized the amount of hours that were actually given by our employees. And the money is like USD 28,000, which is part of our community investment as well.</p><p>So -- and it's good to do all these kind of things and to see how you can actually incorporate sustainability into your strategy, and see that the results, at the end of the day, are really rewarding. And we see a really positive feedback coming from the markets. We have been among the 25 most sustainable companies in the Swiss SMI Expanded Index. At the same time, we were also among the 10% of the world leaders within listed in the world -- in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We have the highest score in information security, cybersecurity and resilience. And at the same time, the highest score in environmental management and environmental policy. At the same time, we were also -- we're listed in the FTSE4GOOD. We have really positive and good ratings for MSCI and ISS, Environment and Social scores. Also, we have received the gold medal from EcoVadis, which actually evaluates the supply chain. And we are also happy and proud of our people, as we have been recognized in 5 different regions, in 5 different countries, with 5 Great Places to Work recognitions in Luxembourg, Greece, Europe, UAE and India.</p><p>So I would like to close with one very simple message that we will be -- we will continue to do what we know best, which is actually delivering IT services, IT software to financial institutions of any size around the world. This is exactly what we know how to do best, but the right way, not just the easy way. Thank you very much.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Thanks, Kalliopi. Thank you very much. Well, amazingly, we're about 30 seconds ahead of schedule. So if you bear with us just for one second, we're going to set up some chairs for Q&amp;A. And anyone on the webcast, if you'd like to submit a question, you can do so through the link under the main screen. I've got an iPad here, and I can read those questions out. If I can ask Max, Takis, Mark and Colin to join me on stage, we'll go to Q&amp;A. There will be some mics around the room as well. So please put your hand up if you have a question you'd like to ask.</p><p>So if you could just introduce yourself and who the question is directed to, that would be great.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>CHARLES BRENNAN, RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Charlie Brennan here from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Just a high-level one to start with, if that's okay. On one of the opening slides, you laid out the market opportunity that suggests that the payments was the fastest-growing opportunity and fund administration was pretty high up there. But we've hardly heard about payments and fund [admin] at all. Do you feel like you're underweight in payments, especially relative to what's been going on in the U.S. and some of the M&amp;A? And can you just update us where you are with the Bloomberg relationship? I haven't heard from them in a while. Thank you.</p><p>MAX CHUARD: Thanks, Charlie, for that. Yes. I would say it's a very good question. And we try to package the day in the most efficient as we could. And if you look at the -- some major initiatives that we've done in the last 12 months, clearly, we thought we should focus the discussion today more on Infinity, including the acquisition of Kony and Avoka. So that's probably why we focused more on that part. But definitely, we've done a lot on the payment. And on the payment in fact, what I can say, we are doubling the investment we are putting in the product. So I truly believe that there is a big opportunity on the payment side. So it's not because we've not spent like 30 minutes on payment today that we don't see that as a big opportunity for us. At the same time, on the Multifonds side, we continue to invest, we continue to innovate at the whole [UXI] thing. We're putting this on the cloud as well. So a lot is happening. But somehow, I think it was already quite a long day. We try to focus. But next time, we'll spend more time on them.</p><p>On the Bloomberg opportunity, we announced that around a year ago. And I think it took us longer than we were expecting to be able to package the offering within the Bloomberg network. Obviously, Bloomberg operate at huge volume and scale, I mean, whatever goes into the network of Bloomberg has to pass so many [tailors] it took longer than expected. Finally, all the tests that have been done, and we expect to sign our first customers very soon. Clearly, I was expecting this to go faster. Let's be honest. I still believe that once we've got the first customers that we sign up with the offering, the business case is very strong. I think there is really a market for that for a shadow accounting as such. And once we've got the first customer here, we'll see the traction. Bloomberg continues to be highly focused, committed to it. Probably the mention to us when we engaged in the partnership that it takes longer than you think to get through all our different security walls and to be able to be up and running. But typically, the Temenos way, we want to go fast, we want to go and deliver immediately. And probably it took longer than we were expecting.</p><p>But to summarize, I believe the opportunity is still there, and I'll keep you posted on the progress.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Great. James?</p><p>JAMES ARTHUR GOODMAN, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's James Goodman from Barclays. I wanted, firstly, just to come back to the cross-selling opportunity in the U.S., and not Infinity into your core base, which you've articulated very well, but whether it's realistic at all to think that you can increasingly sell Transact into some of the Kony base over time. And I just remember this time last year that you -- or at the last Capital Markets Day, I think you talked about a front office client, which was seriously thinking about implementing a back office Transact system. So in light of those sales cycles, what needs to be done to get that to sort of come to fruition?</p><p>And then just secondly, on the proportion of revenue from larger clients versus smaller clients, which we've discussed a few times today, and you've emphasized the larger client focus. I think yesterday, it was one of the biggest SKUs we've seen towards, actually, the lower-tier bank. So I just hope you can help us understand what it is, at the moment, in your sales structure is focusing on some of the smaller banks, which is going to change towards the larger.</p><p>MAX CHUARD: Just on the U.S., Infinity, I think it's not just in the U.S. But clearly, we believe that to enter a relationship [in each] on the front with Infinity in the back with Transact, ultimately, the full benefit, as we've seen in the value benchmark is to have an end-to-end solution and then some. Probably in the U.S. right now, with the dynamics in the market, we see the Infinity probably as a better way to start into a relationship. But definitely, the goal is to go through an end-to-end transformation. And that customer that you mentioned before who is an Infinity customer and are using at the back, legacy third-party core, now that they are going through the benefit of our modern technology at the front end, they see the limitation of what they can get ultimately out of the solution because of having a back-end software, which is still batch and so on. So if you really want to have the whole opportunity of our solution, we believe the end-to-end transformation is ultimately where you need to go. It takes time. As we know that to innovate the back end, it takes time. But we do believe that once we are into the relationship, that's the best way to go about it.</p><p>PANAGIOTIS SPILIOPOULOS: Let me take the second one. If you look at current trends, you have 3, which are basically putting or working into that number. So on the one hand, you have the increasing number of, let's say, smaller banks, so Tier 3 to Tier 5 moving to the cloud. That's obviously pushing to a lower Tier 1, Tier 2 share. On the other hand, we have Infinity being also actively marketed and sold to the large Tier 1, Tier 2 banks. So that's offsetting that. If we can get it done and we strongly believe it will happen, what Max just said, eventually selling front to back also to larger U.S. banks, Commerzbank and this kind, that will push it up again. So overall, that's why we think it should be around 45% to 55% in the medium term with those trends basically equalizing more or less each other.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Michael, do you have a question?</p><p>MICHAEL FOETH, HEAD OF INDUSTRIALS TEAM, BANK VONTOBEL AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Actually, I wanted to follow-up on the -- sorry, it's Michael Foeth from Vontobel. I wanted to follow-up on the cross-selling. You were very excited about cross-selling when you acquired Kony. And I was wondering if you can update us on how much of your Infinity customers actually taking up the Kony offer. So what the -- how the cross-selling is really working out in the U.S. there more specifically.</p><p>MAX CHUARD: Okay. I think we -- what you mentioned about Kony is Kony is now part of our Infinity of financing. This is so exciting. And one of probably the distinction of Temenos is when we buy a company, we integrate it. We fully integrate those companies. And that's why within a year, we've been able to come up with the best digital front-office platform by putting the Temenos assets, the Avoka assets and the Infinity assets. And that's why all of that together is now in our Infinity platform. And definitely, we see this as an opportunity to create massive synergies and to accelerate sales.</p><p>I think you've been able to see how, over the years, M&amp;A has been able to accelerate our sales because of being synergistic transactions. So on that side, I'm very pleased. And we will continue to look at transactions that can complement and accelerate our growth rates.</p><p>MICHAEL FOETH: And maybe a second question regarding -- you talked about Europe as also being a significant driver of growth still over the next 5 years. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the growth dynamics of Infinity in Europe versus core banking?</p><p>MAX CHUARD: I think Infinity -- and this is why the Infinity came out just a U.S. play, it's a global play, and we've got some very exciting discussion happening in Europe with some of our largest customers on the Infinity side. So I think the Infinity is extremely well fitted for the -- every market. So there is no limitation to what it is. I think you've got 2 clear trends on the digital front end. You need to be able to provide more personalized customer experiences, you need to be able to onboard faster, you need to offer all those things that we've discussed in the morning, and the back end need to be able to automate to bring more efficiencies. And we see -- clearly, see those 2 drivers being very, very strong.</p><p>And probably in Europe, on the Transact side, because of the fact that banks are truly on the return on equity and the cost base is so high, they need to address that where, potentially in the U.S., the profitability is higher and [chance] there is a focus on driving growth. And then once you get the growth, you also want, obviously, to have the full benefit of an end-to-end solution.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Josh, would you like...</p><p>JOSH LEVIN, ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Josh Levin for Autonomous. My question is about the long-term guidance. So a big focus today has been about the robust outlook for SaaS. So you also said that SaaS is not cannibalizing existing sales, they're incremental. So you think that would be accretive to your long-term earnings forecast? On the other hand, SaaS has a different revenue stream profile than on-prem. You collect less revenue upfront and more over time. But as you went and revisited the long-term guidance ahead of the Capital Markets Day, maybe you could talk a little bit in more detail about the puts and takes and why the long-term forecast hasn't changed, either up or down.</p><p>PANAGIOTIS SPILIOPOULOS: Okay. So I think what we can say today and with our current forecast with incorporating strong ACV or SaaS development, we are very confident because of the good work that Colin is doing that despite the increasing proportion of SaaS, we still have a lot of tailwind also on profitability just by scale. Now what we see in the long term is still, eventually, a large part of the, let's say, non-Tier 1 Transact business, okay, moving to the cloud, okay? So that's basically the basis of our long-term forecast.</p><p>Now whether we, in 7 or 10 or 12 years, always get to the 15%, we honestly don't know. However, from today's perspectives, given the market size and the market opportunity and seeing it as incremental, we said, implicitly, it's 15%-plus. We're very confident on this one, despite the SaaS business becoming more important. So far, we really haven't seen any material impact in terms of the license business, okay?</p><p>Should this happen in 3, 5 years, we obviously would have to revisit then, and then we would have to look at the profitability and the famous fish curve, how would that look like, okay? But from today's perspective, I think this is the right assessment.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Adam?</p><p>ADAM DENNIS WOOD, EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. I've got 3, if I could. Just first of all, on -- you talked a lot about microservices today. In the past, we've heard about the move from a kind of big bang migration for banks to modular approaches. Now we're talking about microservices. Could you maybe just tangibly talk a little bit about how that's different for a bank? Are you basically breaking modules down into microservices so that the change can be at an even more granular level than in the past? And how does that make it easier for banks to move versus how it would have been on a modular approach?</p><p>Could you maybe just talk a little bit about integration between Infinity and back end? I appreciate there's open APIs, but I guess, the 30, 40-year-old mainframe based core banking systems are pretty challenging to integrate to. Could you talk a little bit about how you're managing that?</p><p>And then maybe finally, could you talk a little bit about deal sizes? So how does an Infinity deal for a same-sized bank compare to a Transact deal? And how did some of these SaaS deals compare to what you would have got from on-premise?</p><p>MARK WINTERBURN: Yes. So on the microservices piece. As I talked about this kind of this history of innovation where things come and go, and we talked about our modules and modularity before. To be ready for cloud and the SaaS market, as I said years ago, we decided to change the way that we build software and to make it much more granular. Now that was the start of a change for us. That was an internal thing. But years ago, we'd acquired a company, and they were hosting banks, and the size of the change that the bank could digest overnight. It had to be much smaller. So in the past, a big chunky kind of 1,500-day kind of change. And there's no way you could be bundling those and implementing those on a frequent basis if you had 50 credit unions on a multi-tenant process. So everything changed to be more granular. That's fine. But the way we wanted to architect the system, that those pieces had to be completely ring-fenced, if you will, so it had to be componentized that to be built in a way that you know exactly what changes and how the whole piece is interlinked.</p><p>So even if you do that, smaller chunks of change, there's more work to do around the architecture of the product. So their go-to-market services, people often talk about the spaghetti to chunk it into ravioli. The clever there is knowing the status of those, such that a bank can take changes in a piece with them to change the whole bit. Because even now, if you put a fix in, you can do that one fix. But it's going to drag everything it needs, and you end up putting all that to change and you don't need to. So the beauty of micro services is that you are containerizing the code in a way that -- I was talking to someone in the break about leakage, price leakage, so you get revenue leaks. They've got multiple back ends that are priced accurately as they need to.</p><p>We talked earlier about us offering the way to do enterprise pricing regardless of the back end, right? We've got all the code to do that. But it's only by introducing microservices and writing it in a way that it can be implemented standalone safely that banks can then take back value quickly. So we would still say that, over time, they need to renovate their core. They need to swap them out to modern 24/7 real-time digital core. That, to us, it is not, if they need to, that merely went. However, as part of the business case and getting the thing written to take value quickly, they can take these microservices, be it distribution or be it Transact and take value quickly and then build out as they go to allow them a different implementation option. So that's all it is. It's merely to be able to do it safely and to be able to do it in the order that they want, right, so they can get value quickly. So that would be how I would sort of characterize the microservices thing.</p><p>In a sense, there's nothing new in the world, as you can modules and stuff like that, what we've done is make it clever so that we know exactly which level of code is which. You can take that a bit of code. You can say, \"Hey, that pricing thing worked well. I want to take this next, maybe a product hub.\" So despite the core as you've got in the back, you can have a central way of deploying new products to your customers quickly. We would still say that, over time, and there was a question about in the U.S. about our digital-first, will they go core. We believe they will because if you implement a new digital front-end, a piece of Infinity, if you will, it merely helps to point out how old-fashioned, how restricted that core is, whether it's running batch overnight, whether there's a single view of the customer and the things that we take for granted. So I think this putting microservices out there will mean, a, banks that wouldn't do change because they're scared now can; b, it merely serves to underline the shortcomings of their existing legacy cores. So that was that bit. And then there was a bit on...</p><p>PANAGIOTIS SPILIOPOULOS: Yes. So Adam, let me answer it this way. Today, and given we just integrated Kony and a large number of banks in the U.S., the average deal size, Infinity versus Transact, is definitely smaller, whether it's in the license or an ACV model. But if you look forward, and Max talks about it, if you look at the Infinity pipeline and seeing some very large banks interested in that, you could have million or multimillion deals in Infinity and not just in Transact. So I think it will be shifting towards a much higher average deal size on the Infinity side. While on Transact, I think we'll maintain our strong position there with more banks like Varo coming onstream. Maybe there is a slightly lower value going forward. But also, you have to consider that the sales cycle for Infinity is much shorter as it is for the implementation timeframe. So for us. I mean, this is not a KPI we are specifically tracking to judge the health of the business.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Felix, did you have a question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes. Felix (inaudible) from Tech Capital. Two questions, if I may. You talked last year about 6 growth -- drivers of growth. Now you just mentioned 5. So it appears to be wealth management slipped away. Can you update us on that?</p><p>And the second question, I mean, you expressed your confidence on your long-term targets, specifically on 15%-plus licensing growth. Your guidance for 2020, appears to be a bit lower than that. So you mentioned that you want to be cautious, but why do you want to be cautious? What is causing that cautiousness?</p><p>MAX CHUARD: Listen, on the 5 to 6 drivers of growth, that was intentional. We wanted to make sure that you are following year-on-year. No what happened is, as we've integrated the wealth part, which we were showing the sixth driver was the worst front office, and this is now fully integrated within the Infinity platform. And that's why now we classify this as part of Infinity. So there is nothing. So it's still the same products. However, now it's fully integrated within Infinity. So with that, the 6 we were talking before is now equivalent to 5.</p><p>On the guidance, listen, it's early 2020. We gave a guidance, which, organically, the growth is 10% to 15%. And we take a cautious start to the year. And as we did last year, ultimately, we delivered again 15%-plus of like-for-like growth. That's the way we start the year, and this is how we started this year as well.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Great. I've got -- I have 3 questions on the webcast here quickly. So I think, first one for Mark, is it possible to upgrade from T24 to Temenos Transact without a full migration?</p><p>MARK WINTERBURN: Yes, it is. So we've done kind of a whole range of upgrades over the years. And one we're really proud of is pre-T numbers. We took on a pre-T number and upgraded that. I think it was to [R18] at the time. You can always upgrade with the kind of minimum amount of work. There are certain pieces of the new architecture as we go forward that you'd probably have to say you've got to get to that release as a base case for doing some of the work. So I probably need to check that with Tony on the exact payment.</p><p>I think there are a couple of things we're putting in now where, to leverage the newer offerings, you'd have to get to at least [R18 or 19], I mean, I meaning to share that. You don't need to do any more than a normal upgrade process to get you through it. It's not like a reinstall or anything like that.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Great. Second question is actually for Kanika. I don't know if we can get a mic over to Kanika there. A question on Temenos Value Benchmark. Is there any cooperation with partners? Is the program part of the partner model? Or just provided by Temenos alone, given that some of your partners have consulting practices?</p><p>KANIKA HOPE: No, this is exclusively Temenos because of the nature of the -- the sensitive nature of the data, and it's built on that inherent trusted relationship directly with our clients. So we've had to incorporate in the legal terms and conditions that the content will not be shared with any third parties, either on the client side or on our side. So there was one clarification in order to make. I mentioned strategy consultants, they're all in-house Temenos professionals sourced from strategy houses. So we do this exclusively ourselves.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Great. One question here on Infinity. Which competitor do you meet the most in front office bids? Do you want to take that? Or Brian?</p><p>MAX CHUARD: Listen, probably one of the main competitor is Backbase that we see, I would say, in Europe quite a bit. And I think since we bought Kony and we came up with Infinity, I think we've massively been able to strengthen our position and to show the leadership on how we -- how our offering is much stronger. I think one of the things that we discussed during the session is how we are able to offer an end-to-end solution where, for instance, those competitors will be only at the front-end side only. And clearly, the fact that we can also have the full end-to-end, it's strengthening our position. But as well, just on the Infinity, I think, what we did build is, by far, the best-in-class. And there is no reason why we should not be winning against anyone in the market because of the strength of the offering.</p><p>MARK WINTERBURN: I would just add to that, that obviously, done a fair bit of M&amp;A. And the Kony one was one of -- because the culture of the company is where we were based, what we wanted to achieve. Well, despite it being the largest, it was also the quickest in the sense if we knew exactly which components from Temenos, from Avoka, from Kony as well as we would put together and how. We had that worked out. We couldn't do certain things before we got the sign-off. But once we had the sign-off, we had an ambitious 30-day and 90-day plan to just put the thing together because it was so clear how it was going to fit, you know this bit went there. And so that's really helped us [with pall] the opposition quickly. It doesn't take months to do this, but we knew exactly which technology we'd base it on and how we'd go to market.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Great. Was there one final question from the floor before we wrap up, I think? Yes. Sure. Hannes do you want to go ahead?</p><p>HANNES LEITNER, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF SOFTWARE, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hannes Leitner from UBS. And I got a couple of questions as well. So the first one is, you talked much more about front office. So Infinity Products group, it feels that this is a reflection of the market. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the trends you see, when will be the core banking coming back, how is the pipeline shaping up for [TCA] next year.</p><p>MAX CHUARD: I think we talked a lot about Infinity because it's a newer solution. I think that Transact continues to represent the largest part of our business. It continues to be growing at the double-digit. So we continue to be very excited. We discussed quite a bit about what we are doing on the microservices side as well for Transact to find ways to continuously renovate, even the largest bank. So we are doing a lot on Transact. But it's true that Infinity is very exciting because it's a huge market, and it's growing very fast. And we see clearly a very strong opportunity for us to position our solution there and also, ultimately, to cross-sell our back-end solution. So that's why, I think, probably we made more focus today on Infinity is because of being a newer solution for us.</p><p>HANNES LEITNER: And regarding the U.S. opportunity, you showed a couple of good growth rates in terms of headcount and salespeople. If I exclude the Kony contribution of that, it seems rather more that the headcount in the U.S. remained flat year-over-year. Could you talk about the opportunity there in terms of your implementation at Commerzbank, which should I think go live in Q1? And then about the pipeline and specific about the U.S.</p><p>MAX CHUARD: Listen, the -- as I said, we look at the acquisition as a way to accelerate growth. So clearly, the case of Kony was around the product side, about the talent, the people. So clearly, the fact that they had so many go-to-market people that knew the U.S. market so well as east-west coverage, that was part of the interest of the acquisition as well. So that's why I'm very pleased that we have been able to gain so many skilled people that will sustain the growth going forward in the U.S.</p><p>As I said yesterday on the call, Commerce is due to go live in H1. So that's a very major milestone. Things are going extremely well. We're in testing mode right now. So I expect everything to be in line. So no surprise on that side. And the pipeline in the U.S. continues to build very nicely, both on the Infinity side, but as well on the Transact side. On the payment side, we've got initiatives on the Multifonds side. So clearly, there is -- we've got a very large portfolio. I think as we discussed, in the U.S., we do see a focus on the distribution side, on the Infinity part. But definitely, the core and the other products, we are also structuring our sales force to be able to address all those different products.</p><p>ADAM SNYDER: Thank you, Max. Look, that just leaves me to say thank you very much for joining us today. Just a quick plug, Temenos Community Forum in Madrid at the end of April to meet clients, partners, developers, all of us again, more product people, see demos. We'd love to have you there. If you would like to join, please just let me know.

However, pricing and the number of shares to be sold have not yet been determined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Limelight expects to receive up to $140 million in proceeds, which are earmarked for capital expenditures, working capital, debt payoff and possible acquisitions, according to the filing.</p><p>Selling stockholders also would receive some of the funds, but details have not been finalized, said Limelight Chief Financial Officer Matthew Hale.</p><p>Joe Blankenship, vice president of research for Source Capital Group Inc. in Scottsdale, said the market for technology IPOs nationally is \"fair to good,\" but there has been little exper\u00adience in Arizona of late.</p><p>The last big tech offering here dates back more than five years, he said.</p><p>\"Most of the prospects for good IPOs were bought up before they could go public,\" Blankenship said.</p><p>In fact, the number of initial offerings and public companies in general has fallen in the state. The number of Arizona companies traded on major exchanges has dropped from more than 80 to about 60.</p><p>\"There is a little bit of a headwind for companies going public in U.S. markets,\" said Tom Duening, director of entrepreneurial programs at Arizona State University's Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. He points to accounting regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley as well as economic factors.</p><p>It is far more common today for up-and-coming business to court the bigger companies, he said.</p><p>\"The joke going around is that the last page of every business plan says, 'Our exit strategy is to be acquired by Google.' The reason is these companies are flush with cash,\" Duening said.</p><p>Limelight, however, is a larger company that has attracted major funding from investors, he said.</p><p>Limelight, founded in 2001, had 158 employees as of March 1. It has had numerous equity investments, the most recent being a $130 million round in July led by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.</p><p>Limelight delivers content digitally for traditional and emerging-media companies in industries from television and music to magazines, movies and software. Using Limelight's delivery network, clients provide their end-users with content, including video, music, games, software and social media.</p><p>For example, when computer users get a notice to update a software program or an Xbox user wants to download a new game or movie, the company's network makes it easier to download those big files, Hale said.</p><p>Limelight's revenue has grown from $11.2 million in 2004 to $64.3 million in 2006. Although the company posted six-figure net income in both 2004 and 2005, it reported a $3.7 million loss last year.</p><p>The loss was attributed to an increase in option and restricted stock grants coupled with an increase in the fair market value per share, according to Limelight's S-1 filing with the SEC. The company also reported litigation expenses of $3.2 million and involvement in a lawsuit with a competitor that has alleged patent infringement.</p><p>Underwriters for the offering are Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.; Morgan Stanley; Jefferies Broadview; Piper Jaffray; and Friedman Billings Ramsey.</p><p>GS Capital Partners Entities, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs, is Limelight's largest shareholder, holding a 45 percent stake.</p><p>Limelight's IPO would be the first for Arizona since First Solar Inc.'s $400 million deal in November. Prior to that, the last IPO to take effect was Kona Grill's in 2005.</p><p>Domain registrar The Go Daddy Group Inc. filed the necessary paperwork for an IPO in May 2006, but withdrew the offering in August. RSC Holdings Inc., parent to a Scottsdale-based equipment rental firm, filed for an IPO in February, and that offering still is pending.</p><h>FAST FACTS</h><p>Limelight Networks Inc.Description: Delivery network for Internet content providers Address: 2220 W. 14th St., Tempe Web: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.limelightnetworks.com\">www.limelightnetworks.com</url> CEO: Jeffrey W.

It owns some of the biggest video game franchises in the world. And after years of growth it has become one of the largest internet companies in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet on Wednesday, Tencent stumbled, missing earnings targets and posting a drop in profit growth for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As surprising as the slip up was the reason behind it: China\u2019s government.</p><p>Bureaucratic reshuffling at the top levels of China\u2019s government made it difficult for the company to get the licensing required to make money on new games, Tencent\u2019s president, Martin Lau, explained on an earnings call. In a separate case, Chinese regulators pulled another game \u2014 Monster Hunter: World \u2014 because its content was deemed too gory.</p><p>\u201cA lot of games have not been approved,\u201d said Mr. Lau, adding that the government was aware \u201cthe restructuring is now affecting the industry as a whole.\u201d</p><p>The admission was a rare acknowledgment of the outsize role China\u2019s government can play in the fortunes, and misfortunes, of its most important private companies.</p><p>Under President Xi Jinping, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/technology/china-xi-jinping-technology-innovation.html\">Beijing has sought closer control over China\u2019s largest internet companies</url>, many of which were founded and grew large in the absence of Beijing oversight. While the goal has been in part to harness the creative capabilities of the companies, many Chinese tech executives fear the yoke of the government.</p><p>Excessive bureaucracy, heavy-handed censorship and overreach into day-to-day management all come as downsides to a company having Beijing in its corner. For China\u2019s largest companies, though, there is no choice. In a famed quote, the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, warned executives to strike a balance. Love the government, he advised, but don\u2019t marry it.</p><p>An emblem of China\u2019s growing innovative prowess, Tencent, which owns the messaging and payments app WeChat, has nonetheless been a beneficiary of Beijing\u2019s policies. Government internet blocks have kept out would-be rivals like Facebook. Other plans that will bolster the company include a government initiative to turn WeChat into a form of digital national identification.</p><p>But China has been a double-edged sword.</p><p>Last year, Tencent was one of several private internet companies that had to inject funds into a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/dealbook/china-unicom-tencent-alibaba-soe-reform.html\">struggling state telecom</url>. Tencent\u2019s hugely popular mobile game, Honor of Kings, also fell victim to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/china-honor-of-kings.html\">regulations last year</url>, over concerns that teens were spending too much time on it.</p><p>Tencent\u2019s results helped push shares of some American tech companies, many of which look to China as a potential key growth market, lower on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite index fell about 1.2 percent.</p><p>\u201cOne of the prevailing assumptions, particularly around tech and tech hardware, is China equals growth,\u201d said Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management. \u201cSo when one of the leading names, the names you look for to take the pulse, comes up sick, that can shake you up a little bit.\u201d</p><p>On Thursday, Tencent\u2019s shares fell by 3 percent in Hong Kong trading. Over the past five days, they have lost more than one-tenth of their value as investors grew increasingly concerned about regulatory hurdles and rising competition. Since the middle of last week, Tencent\u2019s market value has fallen by more than $50 billion.</p><p>Holding up earnings this past quarter has been Tencent\u2019s inability to make money in China off PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battleground, or PUBG, a popular game that pits players against one another in a battle to the death on an island covered with weapons, vehicles and sniper nests. Tencent said it was working closely with regulators to get the license, which would allow it to make money on the game by, for instance, selling virtual items within the app.</p><p>Mr. Lau said that the company was working diligently to get the approvals. Ultimately the problem is a matter of the timing of the signoffs, not whether they will be acceptable, Mr. Lau added. Some have objected to the violence in PUBG, which is often played by devotees on smartphones, volume up on their phone speakers, in public places like trains and parks. The game, Monster Hunter: World, was pulled entirely for its content, though Mr. Lau said the company was working to \u201cadjust the content\u201d so it could gain approval.</p><p>\u201cThe regulatory headwind is definitely having a toll\u201d on Tencent\u2019s gaming revenue, said John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, noting that the company has not been able to monetize a key title like PUBG.</p><p>WeChat has also faced new competition from several smaller companies that make apps that allow users to share short videos.</p><p>Concerns about the competition and the increased regulatory oversight have weighed on the company\u2019s share price for months. Its stock price has fallen almost 30 percent from peaks in January.</p><p>The company\u2019s second quarter net profit fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier to $2.7 billion. Its revenue in the period rose 30 percent, to $11.1 billion.</p><p>Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter: @paulmozur.

Indeed, the lion's share of the screen's success in the period can be attributed to a single stock: Shire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only four out of the 10 long stocks picked by the screen in June outperformed the market and, of them, Shire was the only one which outperformed with any real gusto. Shire's shares were up 43 per cent in the period thanks to an agreed takeover by US drugs company AbbVie. Without the inclusion of Shire, the nine other stocks would have dropped by 1.3 per cent on aggregate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The significance to the overall performance of the screen that can be attributed to Shire helps emphasise the importance of a portfolio approach when using highly-mechanised screening processes, such as momentum. The short picks from June (shares which are meant to do badly in the coming period) failed to find a loser to rival the winner the longs found with Shire.</p><p>The worst performing short was Royal Mail which dropped 12.8 per cent as the lustre of its recovery and income story continued to fade. Unfortunately, the short portfolio did contain some major winners, including ITV which was the second best performing blue chip of the period after Shire - it rose 25 per cent. Another stand out performance from the shorts was a 12.7 per cent rise from Fresnillo, which is also among this current quarter's long picks. All in all the shorts were ahead by 4 per cent.</p><p>It is not too unusual for the shorts to outperform the market, which is the opposite of what they are meant to do. In fact, since I began monitoring the blue-chip momentum screen in June 2007, the shorts have been more likely to outperform the market than underperform it. The short portfolio has actually outperformed 55 per cent of the time compared with the longs that have outperformed 62 per cent.</p><p>But the key difference between the long and short portfolio is not down so much to how often they outperform or underperform the wider market, but rather by how much. Indeed, the Shorts can fall very sharply when things are bad, while the Longs can do extremely well when the market has latched firmly onto positive themes. As the graph below shows, over time the longs have substantially outperformed the shorts despite the potential for the portfolios to frequently move in the opposite direction to the one desired. The longs boast a cumulative gain since June 2007 (ignoring the negative effect of spreads and dealing charges and the positive effects of dividends) of 95 per cent compared with an anaemic 0.5 per cent from the index and a 12 per cent loss from the shorts.</p><p>A</p><p>Momentum</p><p>How the stocks are picked</p><p>The long and short picks listed below are based on performance between 15 June to 8 September rather than the full screening period to 15 September, in order meet for the production schedule of the magazine. I will, however, calculate future performance of the screen based on the full screening period, so the stocks in the official portfolios may differ from those listed below. Shire has been excluded from the Long portfolio given that it is at an advanced stage of an agreed takeover offer process.</p><p>THE LONGS</p><p>Takeover speculation is currently the main force driving ITV's (ITV) shares higher. Specifically, there are rumours that Liberty Global, which holds a 6 per cent stake in ITV, is trying to rally support from other shareholders for a full blown bid. Broker Panmure points out that the recently aborted bid by 21 Century Fox for Warner was pitched at 22 times earnings compared with ITV's current rating of 15 times. Meanwhile, half-year results at the end of July reported some rather disappointing trading at ITV's production company, which many regard as its growth powerhouse, although trading elsewhere was impressive.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|25.1%|GBP8.8bn|220p|16|1.7%|1.96|12.05|-GBP219m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Source: S&amp;P CapitalIQ</p><p>Last IC view: Hold, 204p, 30 Jul 2014</p><p>A</p><p>Shares in commodities trader Glencore (GLEN) were lifted during the quarter by expectation-beating half-year results which were accompanied by news of a $1bn share buyback programme.

Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg also sounded a bullish tone by declaring that the commodities super cycle is still alive and kicking but that prices have been pushed back by over supply from miners. More recently old rumours that Glencore could bid for Anglo American have begun to resurface.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ deb t(-)</p><p>|16.3%|GBP48.7bn|367p|14|2.7%|-|1.65|-$54,292m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC view: Hold, 360p, 20 Aug 2014</p><p>Equipment hire company Ashtead (AHT) just keeps on impressing. As well as its performance being highly geared to the cyclical recoveries in its main end markets (US and UK construction) the company has been winning market share and is also benefiting from a switch from equipment ownership to rental in the vast US market. The company delivered another set of exceptionally strong figures when it reported on its first quarter this month and is also aggressively pushing up capital expenditure, which is a reflection of its confidence in growth prospects. Indeed, while the residential building sector has been performing well for a while, non-residential construction looks at a very early point in its recovery.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|15.0%|GBP5.1bn|1,024p|17|1.1%|1.09|5.85|-GBP1,300m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC View: Buy, 831p, 17 Jun 2014</p><p>A</p><p>Next</p><p>Retail wonder stock Next (NXT) has been busy continuing to prove its credentials over the last three months.

Not only is the traditional growth area, the directory business, continuing to churn out fantastic numbers, but the group's high street stores have also been performing well. This could help margins this year by increasing the proportion of full-priced sales made. The company also has lofty growth targets for its fledgling international business. And, as is usual for this highly cash generative business, share buybacks remain firmly on the agenda.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|13.8%|GBP10.6bn|7,205p|18|1.8%|1.80|37.46|-GBP531m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC View: Buy, 6,715p, 30 Jul 2014</p><p>A</p><p>It looks like the momentum screen could be joining Anglo American (AAL) at a good time. The mining giant was the IC's Takeover Tip of the Year and bid rumours have just begun to emerge. The name in the frame is Glencore (see above) which has made advances in the past. If the speculation plays out and an offer is forthcoming, this could see Anglo deliver for the portfolio. In the meantime, the company is benefiting from efforts to focus on key assets and reduce capital expenditure. The group's first half figures also received a boost from the company's 85 per cent stake in De Beers dimond business.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|10.6%|GBP21.9bn|1,565p|13|3.2%|-|1.06|-$11,430m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC View: Buy, 1,623p, 28 Jul 2014</p><p>A</p><p>ARM Holdings</p><p>Investors are managing to look past a recent slowdown in royalty payments at ARM (ARM), linked to the cycle in the mobile market.

The company reported a hearty 7.6 per cent valuation uplift at the half-year stage. The jump in value was the result of the sale of a 30 per cent stake in Bluewater to Land Securities which caused valuers to reassess how much shopping mall assets are worth in the current climate. As well as a rise in the value of its underlying assets, Intu's shares have also been benefiting from a narrowing of the discount between the share price and underlying net asset value per share. There is less to go for on that front now with the discount below 5 per cent and the market sceptical about the scope for future rental growth from malls.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|9.5%|GBP4.3bn|346p|25|4.3%|-|0.96|-GBP4,232m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC View: Hold, 328p, 4 Aug 2014</p><p>A</p><p>National Grid</p><p>A move by the market into defensive stocks benefited National Grid during the summer months. Indeed, National Grid is one of the most defensive looking utilities of the moment. It is currently one year into a seven-year agreed pricing period and it continues to build on its reputation for exceeding the returns set out for it by the regulator - meaning there is more money available to pay out as dividends. One issue for National Grid is the lack of clear political guidance over investment in energy infrastructure. Until things are clearer, it will be hard for the group to lay down plans for investment in new assets which should boost capital growth.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|9.2%|GBP34.5bn|916p|17|4.6%|3.86|2.87|-GBP23,160m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC View: Buy, 838p, 13 Jun 2014</p><p>A</p><p>Persimmon</p><p>For most of this year the market has been very negative on housebuilders due to fears that a housing market downturn may be in the offing, especially in London and the South East.

But the slew of good news from the recent reporting season has put a little bit of a skip back into the sector's step and Persimmon's (PSN) results were exceptional. The company also remains committed to ploughing cash back into shareholders' pockets as a tactic to avoid over-investing ahead of any new housing bust.</p><p>&lt;xmltable&gt;</p><p>| |Mom (15 Jun - 8 Sep) |Mkt cap |P |Fwd NTM PE |DY |PEG |P/BV |Net cash/ debt (-)</p><p>|8.9%|GBP4.1bn|1,335p|10|5.2%|0.51|2.03|GBP326m|</p><p>&lt;/xmltable&gt;</p><p>Last IC View: Buy, 1,343p, 19 Aug 2014</p><p>A</p><p>Mexican gold and silver miner Fresnillo (FRES) benefited at the start of the momentum review period from a sharp run up in precious metal prices.

The market way also buoyed by news of a special dividend at the half-year stage.

What have we learnt? 1: Big business outside the US is content with Trumponomics. The President sat down with a group of business leaders, mostly from Europe, and they purred. There was little or none of the embarrassment that US business leaders have sometimes shown towards the President. 2: The tax reforms introduced by his administration are a large part of this shift of mood. Though the booming equity markets are probably also part of it, the administration is seen as being able to get things done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3: The President's challenge to free trade is now seen more as an acceptable modification of the present regime rather than a retreat into hard protectionism. If, for example, there are restrictions on Chinese imports into the US, many European business leaders would see that as a reasonable counter to Chinese restrictions on imports.</p><p>3: There is a reassessment of China's openness going on. Last year, President Xi Jinping wowed the audience: it was as though China was seeking to take on the global leadership that was being abandoned by the US. This year, the Chinese leader did not attend, whereas the US delegation arrived in force, with both the Treasury Secretary and the Secretary of State joining the President. This was the biggest US delegation ever to come to Davos and the first serving president to attend since Bill Clinton came in 2000. There was a sense of relief that the US was back, leading to the next point. 5: There is no substitute for US leadership of the world economy. No one else can provide it.</p><p>6: German business is very selfconfident and that confidence was increased by the strong likelihood that Angela Merkel will be able to form a government. But even if there had had to be new elections, the business community was pretty comfortable. The problem for German business is rising labour discontent and rising costs, not politics.</p><p>7: Big tech is worried. If most segments of the business community were reasonably relaxed about their future, the large technology companies were concerned that they were somewhat in the dog house.</p><p>Handling of private information, their treatment of employees, particularly women staff, their relations with suppliers, abuse of monopolistic power and excessive dominance of the news media were all among the areas where they now realise that they are no longer the heroes of the world. 8: There will be an acceptable Brexit deal. The fact that it is so much in the self-interest of both sides means the deal will be negotiated.</p><p>There is, however, one Brexit issue where there is more ambiguity than before: financial services.</p><p>The new information coming out of Davos is that some people in the City think it is on balance better not to have full access to the European market if it means aligning regulation to that of Brussels. Europe is a relatively small part of the City's business and is a slowgrowing market. Better to focus on the rest of the world.</p><p>9: India will be much more important over the next 30 years than I had fully appreciated. It is the fastest-growing large economy in the world and will soon be the most populous. It will want to exert that power.</p><p>10. Finally, the world economy is at an economic sweet spot. There is solid growth but as yet little or no inflation. It won't always be like this. As growth continues there is a danger that the boom will get out of hand. There were rumblings of concern about this at Davos from a number of speakers. At some stage there will be a global downturn. We just don't know when.

It took a lot of elbow grease to drag the Senate's collective attention outside of the Beltway and into the homes and businesses of the American people; but I left my office for the last time in 2019 feeling a deep sense of gratitude for all I was able to accomplish on behalf of my fellow Tennesseans.</p><p>A salute to the suffragists</p><p>As the first woman senator from the Volunteer State, I felt a renewed connection to the women suffragists who gathered in Nashville in 1920 to bring their 72-year campaign for the vote across the finish line. To honor the 100th anniversary of their stunning victory, this year I introduced the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. The bill authorized the Treasury to create $1 silver coins honoring the suffragists at zero cost to the taxpayer with all proceeds benefiting the Smithsonian Institution's Women's History Initiative.</p><p>It was a successful, symbolic effort, and a reminder that no person - man or woman, old or young - should ever be legally defined as somehow less than.</p><p>On that same note, back in January I filed my first piece of legislation in the Senate: the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act. The bill compliments the Trump Administration's pro-life agenda, and would place a statutory prohibition on funneling tax dollars to abortion providers.</p><p>Tennesseans understand that pro-life policies are important - and that the label covers more than the protection of the unborn. My bipartisan \"Rural Health Agenda,\" a package of three bills, will put federal dollars to work on behalf of Tennesseans whose access to health care has been decimated by the recent wave of rural hospital closures.</p><p>Internet access and privacy go hand in hand</p><p>I extended my focus on rural communities to include relief for Tennesseans living without access to broadband. The bipartisan Internet Exchange Act will make sure that these communities are able to build and maintain the infrastructure needed to support high speed internet connections.</p><p>A stronger broadband network will change the game for local businesses and outside investors, but as we well know, connectivity comes at a price.</p><p>Since before I came to the senate, I have supported legislation that puts control over privacy in the hands of consumers. Once passed, my bipartisan BROWSER Act will give consumers a say over how Big Tech puts personal data to work. In return for incorporating opt-in provisions into their data privacy policies, tech companies will be free to innovate and use consumer data to make their platforms profitable - provided they respect their users' decisions to keep some information private.</p><p>As head of the Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force, I have had the privilege of bringing all sides of this debate to the table for frank conversations on how to responsibly regulate Big Tech. I look forward to continuing that work in the new year.</p><p>Tech comprises just one sector of Tennessee's booming economy. This year I worked tirelessly to support and build upon the success of the Trump Administration's tax cuts and introduced amendments into the budget process that would cut wasteful spending. Bills ensuring our beloved artists and musicians are fairly compensated for their creativity rounded out a year focused on allowing individuals to flourish in spite of the government and not because of it.</p><p>Military gets a raise</p><p>Of course, all this means nothing without secure borders and a strong military. The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes funding to support our service men and women at Fort Campbell and all across the country with a 3.1% pay raise. Advanced border security initiatives will stop human traffickers and cartel mules in their tracks; and new investments in artificial intelligence and cyber security will prepare American forces for the future of modern warfare.</p><p>2019 was a good year for Tennesseans; but make no mistake: we're in for a wild ride when the Senate reconvenes in January. There is still so much more work to be done; but as the new year dawns, I will stand by the pledge I made to each and every Tennessean on election night: to defend faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity, no matter what.</p><p>Marsha Blackburn, R-Brentwood, represents Tennessee in the U.S. Senate.

Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA: Today on the show, Trump gets tough on China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We won't back down until China stops cheating our workers and stealing our jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA: And Iran. Will all this toughness benefit America in the end? I have an all-star foreign policy panel to discuss.</p><p>Then to save Facebook and the world we have to strip the social media giant apart. That is the surprising opinion of one of Facebook's co- founders, Chris Hughes. I'll ask him all about it.</p><p>And the race to dominate the Arctic. Who is winning and who is lagging far behind? Find out later.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: But first, here's \"My Take.\" It's graduation season in America and a good time to be leaving college and looking for a job. Despite this week's stock market tremors, the American economy is on solid footing. Now in its 120th month of expansion, there are few signs of bubbles about to burst. Unemployment is way down, inflation is contained, wages are finally moving up. And perhaps most significantly productivity is up. Some of these trends might prove ephemeral, but there is no denying that economic indicators are firmly positive.</p><p>These good numbers, however, are unlikely to change another set of numbers regarding the geography of growth. I was honored to be the commencement speaker at Ohio State University last weekend, and I predicted that graduates looking for a job would get one -- in a city. I cited research by Mark Muro of Brookings who's calculated that over the last decade, the 53 largest American metro areas have accounted for 71 percent of all population growth, two-thirds of all employment growth, and a staggering three quarters of all economic growth.</p><p>In fact, half of all job growth in the United States took place in just 20 cities. Meanwhile, small towns and rural America have lost residents and contributed barely anything to economic growth.</p><p>This two-track economy has of course produced a two-track culture with urbanites and rural Americans increasingly living in their own distinct worlds of news, entertainment and consumer goods. They live different lives and disagree deeply about politics, a trend that is reflective in Washington. As measured by voting records, Congress is now more polarized than previous historical highs that were in the aftermath of Reconstruction.</p><p>So why is this happening? Well, the economic trends are easier to explain having to do with the digital revolution and globalization, basically brain work is more valuable, brawn work less so. The cultural forces have to do with the rise of identity politics and a backlash against a more multi-cultural society and immigration. So we see the forces that are pulling America apart. The question we should be focused on is, what can we do to bring the country together? Surely this has become the question of our times.</p><p>One answer that I've been increasingly drawn to is national service. I was heartened to see two Democratic presidential candidates, Pete Buttigieg and John Delaney endorsed it. And there are many ways to design a national service program, a voluntarily system will probably work better with strong incentives like loan forgiveness and tuition support at its core. A 2013 study argued that current programs could feasibly be scaled up to one million volunteers without taking jobs from existing workers, yielding societal benefits worth more than four times the cost of the program.</p><p>And the programs that already operate in the space like AmeriCorps do good work and have stunningly high approval ratings from their alumni, 94 percent say they gained a better understanding of differing communities; 80 percent say the program helped their careers.</p><p>As Mickey Kaus noted in a prescient 1992 book, John F. Kennedy, the rich graduate of Choate and Harvard, famously served in World War II on a PT boat alongside men who held jobs like mechanic, factory worker, truck driver and fisherman. Imagine if in today's America the sons and daughters of hedge-fund managers, tech millionaires and bankers spent a year with the children of coal miners and farmers, working in public schools or national parks or the armed forces.</p><p>[10:05:08] National service will not solve all of America's problems. But it might just help bring us together as a nation. And that is the crucial first step forward.</p><p>For more go to CNN.com/fareed and read my \"Washington Post\" column this week. And let's get started.</p><p>There's lots of foreign policy news this week and I have the perfect panel to talk about it, all former top officials at the State Department.</p><p>William Burns had a 33-year diplomatic career that culminated in a sting as the deputy secretary of State under President Obama. During his time in that post he led the then secret negotiations with Iran. His new book is \"The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy and the Case for Its Renewal.\"</p><p>Richard Haass was the State Department's director of policy planning under George W. Bush. Today he is president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Paula Dobriansky also worked under Bush 43. She as undersecretary of State for global affairs. She's a senior fellow at the Future of Diplomacy Project at Harvard's Kennedy School.</p><p>Welcome all.</p><p>Bill, let me ask you how should we view the Trump administration's new sanctions on Iran, all of which seems really designed to squeeze the country to what end?</p><p>WILL BURNS, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA: I mean, I think the Trump administration it seems to me is making a very risky bet and that is that you can employ a form of coercive diplomacy which is all about coercion and not at all about diplomacy at least so far. In other words, you can bring maximum pressure to bear on the Iranian regime untethered to realistic games or any active diplomatic channel.</p><p>You know, the president himself says that what he's interested in is a better deal but the facts suggest something else, that his administration is aiming at either the implosion or the capitulation of this regime, neither of which, I think, a realistic games that carries with it I think real dangers of escalation where the Trump administration and hardliners in the Iranian regime, of which there's no shortage, become kind of mutual enablers climbing up an escalatory ladder.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Paula, it's fair to say, though, that the -- that the sanctions have bitten. I mean, the Iranian economy is reeling.</p><p>PAULA DOBRIANSKY, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS: Absolutely. In fact, I think that's what is the underlining success here is that they are showing results, not only the primary sanctions, the secondary sanctions but now the new sanctions that are focused on the metal industry, which is also an important source of revenue for Iran. But you take a look at it, what are the results you have, foreign companies that have left Iran, foreign revenues dropped, oil exports have dropped from 2.5 million barrels a day to under one million.</p><p>In terms of also just Iran's own ability to exercise and engage in it terrorist network and support its terrorist network it has also been severely constrained. But I think that these sanctions combined with diplomacy, which is what the administration is seeking to do, I think is what is going to push it in the right direction and achieve that maximum pressure in order to get results.</p><p>ZAKARIA: What are the results, Richard, that they are looking for, though?</p><p>RICHARD HAASS, PRESIDENT, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: The only results they're looking for, if you listen to the secretary of State, are such fundamental policy changes that it's tantamount to regime change. So I think Bill is closer to the truth here than Paula. It more coercion than diplomacy. Now it'd be another thing if the administration came out and said, OK, we would be prepared to relieve you on sanctions, to some extent. We'd even be prepared to enter a modified Iran nuclear deal if, for example, or expand it to include missiles, and if, for example, we extended some of the so-called sunset provisions, these limits on Iran that are scheduled to expire.</p><p>And if you put together that kind of a diplomatic package, my sense is the Europeans would sign on to it and then you could have something that looks like diplomacy. But at the moment what you simply have is the administration trying to grind Iran down. They are achieving some economic results but this regime isn't going anywhere and this regime we shouldn't forget has any number of ways to push back.</p><p>They are already talking about getting out of the nuclear deal. They could get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. They could go after American troops in Iraq. They could escalate in Syria. Iran has a lot of tools -- cyber, terrorism, military, diplomatic. We should not underestimate them.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Bill, the thing that I worry about is the use of this American unilateral part, certainly the use of the dollar. No other country has joined in this set of sanctions.</p><p>[10:10:04] They are all abiding by the Iran nuclear deal but it turns out it doesn't matter because the dollar is so powerful that -- if all international transactions have to in a sense go through the New York Fed and -- because the Americans have sanctions. But that's leading people in Europe and China and Russia to say, should we have an alternative to the dollar?</p><p>BURNS: No, I think there's a lot of collateral damage in this approach to Iran. I mean, part of it is just about a kind of retreat from a series of agreements, not just the Iran nuclear agreement, the Paris climate agreement, a series of others. Part of it is deepening the fisher between us and our closest European allies, in a sense to include in there Putin's work forum. But a third factor is just what you said, Fareed, and that is over time, and this won't happen overnight, eroding the utility of sanctions as an instrument of American diplomacy.</p><p>We haven't always used it wisely in the past. But it's sometimes been a very effective tool. We're going to wake up a few years from now and find that not only the Russians and Chinese but our European allies have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability of the American financial system.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Paula, last word on this?</p><p>DOBRIANSKY: Well, as we know, the deal before had its significant flaws. Ballistic missile deployment, the -- that area was not addressed and then no less, the kind of aggressive behavior that the Iranians have pursued through their proxies. So these kinds of things have to be accounted for but it seems to me the recent steps that are taken by Secretary Pompeo, in particular, he was in Europe, he was meeting with the Brits, he's going to Moscow. I think that there is active diplomacy taking place here and then no less with the countries of the Middle East who are very gravely concerned about Iran's actions. I think the bottom line here is let's try to go forward with an agreement that really is going to correct some of the egregious actions undertaken by the Iranians. If they're not corrected, they will persist.</p><p>ZAKARIA: All right. Don't go away. When we come back, China. Is there any other option other than a conflict between these two super powers? We'll discuss it when we come back.</p><p>[10:15:53] ZAKARIA: And we are back with William Burns, Richard Haass, and Paula Dobriansky.</p><p>Richard, China, a lot of people who don't support Donald Trump on many things think he's right to get tough with China. That the Chinese have been cheating on trade. Is this the right approach?</p><p>HAASS: I think it's fair to say that he's right to call China out on trade. China was gaming essentially its participation in the World Trade Organization over the last nearly two decades. What I think is questionable are some of our specific goals, some of them are overly ambitious, there's zero chance we're going to get China to remake it's economic model, for example to stop state subsidies of these large state-owned enterprises. That's not going to happen.</p><p>We can get them to probably do more purchases of American exports. We can get them to drop some of the tariff and non-tariff barriers on technology. The biggest problem will be implementation. They will agree not to steal American technology but the fact is at times they will. Either by what they learn through students and investments in this country or the fact that certain things will be carried over the internet and the Chinese will figure ways of getting it out.</p><p>So the choice for us, I think, is whether we're willing to take half a loaf here and there is a pattern here, Fareed. We're just talking about Iran. We could talk about North Korea and other things. This administration has to decide whether it is going to demand that other countries capitulate and give us 100 percent of what we want or whether we're prepared to make some compromises. So essentially whether they are willing to embrace diplomacy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Paula, let me ask you as a conservative Republican, I thought that the Republican Party was in favor of free trade, that it believed tariffs are another form of taxes, that consumers have to pay mightily for these and if you look at the numbers, it's absolutely clear there are huge prices to pay for this. Is it worth it?</p><p>DOBRIANSKY: You were quite right in saying that in terms of tariffs, I think that traditionally Republicans have favored, of course, you know, not imposing a tariff. So here I think the issue is this was used and I think the administration was right to use this as a tool to get the negotiators back to the table to have a corrected course and I also think what's being used here is to try to get Chinese compliance. As we know from administration to administration, it's been very frustrating and there is strong bipartisan support as you suggested to correct this course once and for all.</p><p>So actually, by having tariffs in place, you can make the case that it can provide some strong compliance by the Chinese side and an incentive for them to comply. But finally, I'll just say that for the longer term, no, tariffs I would think that one would not -- would want to not have tariffs in place. That's -- they should be reduced if not eliminated but they are a tool that are being used for negotiation at this time.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Well, let me ask you, because I don't -- I want to make sure we get to this, North Korea. North Korea is now testing missiles again. Have the negotiations with North Korea fail? Were they doomed to fail now that the Russians and North Koreans seem to be talking?</p><p>BURNS: I think Kim Jong-un has now made clear that he has no intention in the foreseeable future of fully denuclearizing. So the practical question is, what can we do to reduce the dangers while preserving the aspirational goal of full denuclearization. And here, if you can set aside the rich irony of what I'm about to say, it's worth taking a look at our experience in the Iran nuclear negotiations.</p><p>You know, after the secret talks through all of 2013 with our international partners, we reached an interim agreement which froze the Iranian nuclear program, rolled it back in some significant respects, imposed some quite tight verification and monitoring procedures, all in return for very limited sanctions relief, preserving the bulk of that leverage for the later comprehensive talks. The two situations are obviously not perfectly analogous.</p><p>[10:20:02] The Iran didn't end, doesn't today with nuclear weapons, the North Koreans have dozens and are expanding their capacity to make more. But I think that logic of trying to make a tangible achievement through diplomacy backed up by real economic leverage is a practical goal. But that would mean setting aside first, you know, love letters and an almost exclusive focus on summitry, kind of diplomacy is an exercise in narcissism, and enabling your negotiators as well.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Richard, it is fair, isn't it, that this was a kind of exercise in narcissism? Trump decided this was his path, the Noble Peace Prize. This is why he first hyped up the threat. We were on the verge of war which we were not, and then hoped to say and I alone was able to bring us back from the brink. None of that has panned out.</p><p>HAASS: There is a pattern here. In every one of these cases we're talking about as well as in several others, the president articulates incredibly expansive goals to get rid of this government, to get rid of nuclear weapons all together, to change an economic model. The means are almost always the same. Rhetoric and sanctions. Some version of tariffs or sanctions. We put economic pressure.</p><p>Interestingly enough what's missing from some of these situations is any real desire to use military force. I'm not advocating it. But we're asking way too much of economic instruments and we're aiming for things that are simply too ambitious. What's missing is a serious use of diplomacy, essentially we'll give something in order to get something. You don't solve problems that way but you put a cap on them and you manage them, and in many cases, that's preferable to drift.</p><p>ZAKARIA: All right. Fascinating conversation. We could go on but we have to leave.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Next on GPS my next guest says Mark Zuckerberg's influence is beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or government, and this guest should know. Chris Hughes co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg and Hughes says Facebook must be split up.</p><p>[10:25:27] ZAKARIA: My next guest says that Facebook is too big. Mark Zuckerberg is too powerful, the company needs to be split up. You might expect such sentiments from, say, Elizabeth Warren who has been railing against the power of tech companies. You probably would not expect such ideas from the co-founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes. But that is what Hughes put forth in a \"New York Times\" opinion piece entitled, \"It's Time to Break Up Facebook.\" And Chris Hughes, who was Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard, joins me now.</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: Thanks for having me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: That was an explosive piece. Let's get right to the chase. The biggest argument against your position is that Facebook provides services for free to people. And when people choose to use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, they are voluntarily ceding that privacy. They know that Facebook is using it and they are accepting the idea that they get an incredible free service that they like, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, in return for allowing Facebook to use their data. What's wrong with that? That's the free market.</p><p>HUGHES: Well, I don't think that's quite right for two reasons. First off, I think that users do pay quite a bit to use Facebook. They don't pay with dollars but they pay with their data and with their attention. You know, the average user is on the site, on Facebook, for an hour a day, on Instagram for 53 minutes, and we are providing immense amounts of data, not just on those apps but as we move around the Web that gets consolidated into our Facebook profile.</p><p>So there is a lot of data and attention going into it, and I think it's also not true because the space is so locked down. Facebook has become such a strong monopoly that there's no alternative. It's not like there is a choice that people could go elsewhere and pay to use another social network that doesn't collect as much data on them or doesn't provide them targeted advertising.</p><p>Facebook is all of social networking because it owns Facebook.com, Instagram, and WhatsApp. So without any kind of competition, there is no accountability. ZAKARIA: But again, what the defenders will say is, yes, but, you know, you wouldn't have had WhatsApp, which is free messaging for large parts of the world, without -- you know, Facebook can afford to take, extend the reach of these programs because it has this dominant position. Again, this is the market at work, people are choosing it.</p><p>HUGHES: Well, if there are other things to choose from then that would be true. But I don't think there are in the social networking space. I think WhatsApp is a good example of a company that serves I think billions of people now and still has somewhat small staff and, you know, the founder of WhatsApp, too, has left the company and Brian has called to delete Facebook, as well.</p><p>The founders of Instagram have also left the company and have not spoken out yet. But I think that there is a sense across the board that Facebook has acquired these companies, is pulling them into the mother ship, and is stifling competition everywhere it can.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So in a way your approach to antitrust, the government theory or government that breaks up monopolies, is a little different from the way we've been operating for the last 30 or 40 years. Ever since Robert Bork famously wrote a book in the 1970s, people have said as long as the consumer benefits from a lower priced product, any degree of consolidated power is OK and you're saying no.</p><p>HUGHES: Well, the long history of antitrust is that it's a way of holding businesses that have gotten too big and too powerful accountable. So it's built on the same principle of checks and balances that our founders outlined in the Constitution for the different branches of government but for the private sector as well. So starting in the 1890s and really all the way up until the 1970s, antitrust was practiced in this country as a check was a check on the large powerful companies that had effectively frozen markets that were preventing competition from doing its thing.</p><p>Now that took a different direction in the 1980s because of the Bork revolution to a more narrow standard. The consumer welfare standard where we focus often really intensely on price gouging and I think that clouds judgment because what we want, if we take a step back is capitalism to work. We want markets to be dynamic, competitive and fair, and sometimes government has to step in when a single company gets too big and too powerful. And I should say America has to step in whether a company is too big and powerful.</p><p>And I should say, this is not just a Facebook problem.</p><p>[10:30:00]</p><p>You know, three quarters of American industries have become more concentrated over the past 20 years. It's rental cars, it's beer, it's pharmaceuticals, it's airlines, we can go through the list. Facebook is one that, you know, just about everybody is familiar with because they use it, but it's not only Facebook.</p><p>FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Your biggest concern you're saying in the piece is the degree to which Mark Zuckerberg has almost total control over what information we all read about access.</p><p>HUGHES: Yes. He -- you know, the way that Facebook is structured as a company, Mark is the CEO, there is a board, but because he owns 60 percent of the voting shares, he's not accountable, really, to that board. It works more like a board of advisors than anything else. He's not really accountable to ysers and thus far, he's not been accountable to government.</p><p>So one thing I don't spend time on in the piece but I think is really important is that we can approach corporate government differently. There is a lot of folks who call for thinking about making sure that boards have a responsibility not just to the bottom line but customers, to suppliers, to the environment, to kind of global responsibility, which, again, was what it was like in the 50s and 60s before the revolution over the past few years.</p><p>So I think that kind of thinking when applied to Facebook would immediately bring accountability to the company, or if the FTC broke up the company or if there were meaningful privacy regulation, that too would bring accountability. But the world that we're in right now is one where I do think Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, near unilateral power.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Now, this is not just a professional argument for you, this is personal, in fact, you begin the piece by pointing out that you last saw Zuckerberg, your college roommate in 2017, and what you describe as a meeting among old friends, kind of a reunion. Has he contacted you since the piece was out?</p><p>HUGHES: No, I haven't spoken to him.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you suspect this is the -- do you think this is the end of your friendship?</p><p>HUGHES: You know, in thinking about writing the piece, I had to come to terms with the likelihood that it is. I hold no ill will towards him personally as an individual, as I say in the piece. I think he's trying his hardest. He's human. You're human. We're all human. We all have our -- we all make mistakes. But I think that in his case, it is different because there is no accountability for those mistakes.</p><p>So in writing the piece, I came to a place where I said, you know, I will probably lose a friend or maybe more over it, but in this case, it's worth it. I think this argument is too important. Facebook is too big and it's something that 2.4 billion people use.</p><p>So now, that said, you know, there are some friendships where you can disagree about things, important things and maybe we have one of those. I don't know. Only time will tell.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Chris Hughes, pleasure to have you on.</p><p>HUGHES: Thanks for having me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Next on GPS, the arctic gold rush. There is oil and gas out there, there are trade routes to open up, so there is a race for the spoils. It will tell you who the winners and losers are when we come back.</p><p>[10:35:00]</p><p>ZAKARIA: Now, for the What the in the World segment. It was once primarily the domain of polar bears and intrepid researchers. But suddenly, the Arctic, that massive expansive frigid water and ice is attracting a lot more attention because the ice is vanishing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passage ways and new opportunities for trade.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZAKARIA: That was Mike Pompeo at a meeting this week in Finland of the Arctic Counsel, a body of eight arctic nations. Pompeo is right, of course. He just refused to mention the culprit, climate change.</p><p>Several outlets also reported that the Trump administration blocked the group from mentioning climate change in its joint declaration, a charge the State Department denied. Nevertheless, whether the administration acknowledges it or not, global warming is raising temperatures around the Polar north twice as fast as the rest of the earth and that is decimating the icecap.</p><p>Arctic ice is melting by an average of nearly 13 percent a decade since 1979. From 1980 to 2018, the size of the icecap shrank by 42 percent. Mike Sfraga, the Head of the Wilson Center's Polar Institute, puts it this way. Climate change is literally opening up a new ocean. Let me be clear here, unlike Secretary Pompeo, global warming is disastrous for our planet.</p><p>But since the ice is already melting, it produces opportunities. The great thaw is creating maritime highways, including the Northern Sea root which extends north of Russia from Europe to Asia. According to the Financial Times, that route would be about 40 percent faster than going through the Suez Canal. And as the story notes, this has spurred a new competition as the world's powers race for domination.</p><p>The Danish shipping company, Maersk, conducted a maiden trial voyage last summer and Chinese ships have also plied the route. Last year, China published a whitepaper in which it stressed the importance of the, quote, Polar silk road, unquote.</p><p>Now, we're still a long way from the Northern Sea route replacing the Suez Canal. But if the sea route did become economically viable, the biggest beneficiary could be the country that controls its waters, and that is Russia.</p><p>Of all the Arctic countries, Russia is the one with the most at stake in the region. One-fifth of its land mass lies inside the Arctic Circle. According to the economist, 30 percent of its GDP comes from the Arctic, much of it from the wealth of natural gas there. And for years, Russia has pouring money into its northern waters.</p><p>Russia has the largest fleet of Arctic ice breakers in the world, more than 40, including the world's only fleet of nuclear ice breakers. These vessels are essential to navigating the ocean there. And President Putin has vowed to build even more in the coming years. As the FT notes, Russia has built or upgraded seven army bases in the Arctic since 2013.</p><p>And how is the United States fairing in this race? Sadly, it has long failed to act on this trend. It has just two ageing ice breakers. Though in February, Congress approved funding to build a new one after years of delay.</p><p>[10:40:03]</p><p>It will be ready in 2024 and represents a fraction of what the U.S. actually needs. Maybe Pompeo's comments signal that the government is finally looking seriously at the Arctic.</p><p>One does wonder whether the refusal to acknowledge global warming has also led to a delay in reacting to opportunities presented by that reality.</p><p>Next on GPS, the man that predicted the 2008 financial crisis and predicted what would cause it. When does Raghu Rajan think the next crisis hit?</p><p>ZAKARIA: Raghu Rahan has held a series of top jobs in the field of economics. He's been the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, India's Fed Chair, Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund. But he's probably best known around the world for a prediction he made while at the IMF.</p><p>In 2005, he presented a paper that foretold the coming financial crisis and reasons for it. He said the complexities of the modern financial system created the risk of a catastrophic meltdown. Few on Wall Street or in Washington chose to believe it. Well, we should listen to him now and read the latest book, The Third Pillar, How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind.</p><p>Raghuram Rajan, a pleasure to have you on.</p><p>RAGHURAM RAJAN, PROFESSOR OF FINANCE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So, first, you have to tell us as the man who very famously predicted the crisis of '07 and '08, the global financial crisis, when everyone else was celebrating the stability of the system.</p><p>[10:45:00]</p><p>Do you worry now it's been a long time, interest rates have been very low, people say there are -- you know, as result, things like stocks have gone up perhaps too much. Do you worry that there is another crisis coming?</p><p>RAJAN: Well, there will be a crisis coming. The question is when. Clearly, what's happened after the global financial crisis is we've built up an enormous amount of debt, not in the same places earlier, in different places.</p><p>ZAKARIA: This time, it's government. It used to be corporations, now, it's government.</p><p>RAJAN: It's now government. But, actually, it also move from households in the U.S. to corporations. Some other countries, for example, China, it's corporations and local government entities. But across the world, we build it up.</p><p>Now, when growth slows, there will be a price to pay. Now, is that price going to be as much as we paid the last time? Probably not. But, you know, the jury is out. It's not in the same place so we won't probably have a banking crisis. The banks are much better calculated (ph) today than before, but it could be elsewhere.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Your book, which I find fascinating, you talk about a hidden dimension, a forgotten dimension. You talk about the market and the state. And you say the market has been allowed to do a lot of work. The state has been allowed to do a lot of work in society. But one thing got left behind, what is it?</p><p>RAJAN: It is the community. That's the third pillar I talk about in my book. What you see over the last 30 years is we've had a tremendous technological revolution. Markets have grown across the world. And, interestingly, the state has gone along with it.</p><p>Most people think that governments and markets are opposed, no, they feed on each other. So we have bigger and bigger government to govern the bigger and bigger market and increasingly more and more powers have moved out of the community into the national level and from the national level to the international level.</p><p>Now, what that does is it disempowers the community. But that is also particularly problematic at this time because the forces of trade, of technological change are hitting different areas very differently. New York doing fantastically, San Francisco doing very well, because they are servicing a global market. However, steel city Illinois, not doing so well because its main manufacturing firms have gone out of business, there's very little employment. We need to figure out how to get employment there. That's a community issue.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So what I love about what you're describing is it really captures that reality that you look at a town in Ohio or Illinois and the jobs that steel mills went away because of the market. It was more efficient to make this stuff in South Korea or in China or because of technology. Government came in and there is -- you know, because of unemployment insurance or because of government workers, so there is -- you know, the only employment often in these communities tends to be hospitals or government employment.</p><p>But what went away with the little shops, the Mom and Pops that maybe Amazon got it rid of, in one hand, the steel factories, and so the community has withered.</p><p>RAJAN: It has withered, but also the change now. I mean, that's -- change has always been taking place. The big difference now is that people feared not only that they don't have opportunity in this new world but their children don't have opportunity. Because what technological change demands is higher and higher skills from people, which means you need a really good school.</p><p>Who provides the school? The community provides a strong school. You need that school in order to get to university. Otherwise, you'll spend many years in remedial education, building up university debt and you end up not actually passing out of -- graduating from the university because you simply are not prepared for it, how to start at the beginning.</p><p>ZAKARIA: How do you strengthen a community? It sounds so intuitive but it must be hard. There's a reason these communities have collapsed.</p><p>RAJAN: I talked about a community, Pilsen in Chicago, the big problem was crime. The murder rate was higher than the death rate of German soldiers in World War 2. In the 1980s, what they did was they decided we need to fix crime first before we get economic activity. Whenever a crime happened, the residence flood out on the streets, so they crowd out the crime. So, you know, the visibility, the transparency of having people around stopped the criminals.</p><p>And then, over time, they started building up more economic activity. Now, it's a place that many people want to move into because it's so flourishing. Their problem now is the rents are going up because a lot of new people are flooding in but it's a better problem to have than -- you know, I don't want to venture out into the streets because I might get shot.</p><p>ZAKARIA: A terrific book. A Pleasure to have you on.</p><p>RAJAN: Thank you very much.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And we will be back.</p><p>[10:50:00]</p><p>ZAKARIA: Between the birth of the Royal Baby in the U.K., the abdication of Emperor Akihito in Japan and King Rama the 10th's coronation in Bangkok, monarchs have been in the headlines recently. It brings me to my question. Which sitting dynasty reigned the longest? Britain's House of Windsor, the Imperial House of Japan, Thailand's Chakri Dynasty or Bhutan's House of Wangchuck? Stay tuned and we'll tell you the correct answer.</p><p>My book of the week is World Without Mind, The Existential Threat of Big Tech by Franklin Foer. The topic is hot in the news today, but this sharply written polemic sounded the alarm a few years ago, sharply written, sharply argued. This book will make you think even when you disagree with it.</p><p>And now, for the last look. I began the show today with advice for students about to graduate. Let me close by remembering the students who never will, like Kendrick Castillo, a senior just three days from graduation who was killed this week when he confronted a shooter at a STEM school in Colorado. The school is seven miles from Columbine High School where, 20 years ago, two teen gunmen massacred 13 people. That shooting shook America to its core. But to this day, little has been done about this uniquely American problem.</p><p>[10:55:02]</p><p>A CNN study published last year found that since 2009, the U.S. has experienced 57 times as many school shootings as six other major industrial nations combined. This academic year alone, there have been 23 shootings at least.</p><p>Of course, it's not just schools. From churches to night clubs, America has a mass shooting problem. And, sadly, those incidents are just a tiny fraction of U.S. gun deaths. Every day, on average, more than 100 people in America are killed or take their own lives with a gun.</p><p>What makes America different? Other countries have mental health problems, they have violent entertainment but only we have absurdly lax gun laws. I've said before that it is a government's first duty to keep it citizens, especially its children, safe. We know how to fulfill this basic mandate and it is well past the time to do just that.</p><p>The answer to my GPS challenge this week is B. The Imperial House of Japan has reigned over archipelago uninterrupted for over 1,400 years. The longest reigning individual monarch alive today is Queen Elizabeth the 2nd, who ascended to the throne 67 years ago. She took the record from Rama the 10th's father when he passed after reigning Thailand for seven decades. In fact, his was one of the longest reigns ever recorded in world history. All this makes FDR's 12 years in power look like the blink of an eye.</p><p>Thanks to all of you for being part of my program this week. I will see you next week.</p><p>[11:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019051201CNV18</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3S-G341-JB20-G008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 12, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Personal flying transportation</p><p>Over the course of the last year a number of jetpack and personal flying machines were developed and successfully flown by engineers from across the world.</p><p>French inventor Franky Zapata said he had only a \"50% chance of success\" when he attempted to <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.sky.com/story/franky-zapata-french-hoverboard-inventor-successfully-crosses-channel-for-the-first-time-11777090\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cross the Channel on his flyboard</emphasis></url>.

The futuristic vehicles are intended to be in action this year.</p><p>9. Living homes as our own personal factories</p><p>Professor Rachel Armstrong is a professor of experimental architecture at Newcastle University, and co-ordinator of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flivingarchitecture-h2020.eu&amp;data=02%7C01%7Caj.martin%40sky.uk%7C3dd34cb1df5445b3ff1508d778d65464%7C68b865d5cf184b2b82a4a4eddb9c5237%7C0%7C0%7C637110734250821622&amp;sdata=7EK7%2B3084hTrwv1xyDyftUckWV06DF6BVy%2F%2F%2FKcOTA4%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">living architecture</emphasis></url> project. She said:</p><p>\"By the year 2030 houses are more self-sufficient in terms of energy and resources to the point where we are weaned off fossil fuel-based domestic systems.</p><p>\"Using the incredible processing power of microbes, the tiny organisms that make our soils fertile and whose ancient ancestors are contained within fossil fuels, each home will have a \"digester\" that, provides an ideal home for microbes, which feed on our liquid waste.</p><p>\"As they feed on our waste fluids, they turn them into clean water, low power 12V electricity supply and a range of organic compounds that can be used for a range of things like fertiliser.</p><p>\"Cleaned water will be recycled back into our bathrooms and kitchens, reducing our overall water consumption.</p><p>\"Organic matter will be used to feed our pot plants, window boxes and gardens, so we won't need to buy fertilisers to make them greener.</p><p>\"The low-power electricity supply will not only be able to charge our mobile phones and lighting but also perform a range of automated tasks using robots around our home.</p><p>\"Fitted with an artificial intelligence that \"knows\" just how much energy and resource you, your plants and microbes need to have a healthy home, these \"cyborg\" systems will become a \"living\" system that looks after us.</p><p>\"Different kinds of microbes can make different useful products, like heat and now that we've learned how to engineer them using synthetic biology techniques, new regulations will enable them to be installed in homes under specific conditions where they make high value products like vitamins, medicines, food and even remove pollutants.</p><p>\"People living in these homes are no longer just consumers of resource but are producers of valuable substances that can be used to trade, or give to others in need, forming the basis of a new kind of \"off-grid\" domestic \"economics\".</p><p>8. What won't change - the nature of humanity</p><p>Professor Genevieve Bell has a PhD in cultural anthropology and after a long career at tech giant Intel now heads the 3A Institute in Australia, examining the human impact of AI. She told Sky News:</p><p>\"When asked about the future, I often look at the past. It might not give us the answers, but it always helps me frame better questions and points of view.</p><p>\"I think that is because the things that make us human change very slowly, certainly nowhere near as fast as technology changes.\"</p><p>She added: \"Back in 2003, science fiction writer William Gibson said: 'The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.' I believe there are parts of the future that are all around us, we just need to look for them.</p><p>\"The proliferation of smart devices, be it smartphones, robot vacuum cleaners or smart speakers in the home, are part of a long wave of automation of domestic tasks, and of using digital technologies where once things were analogue, mechanical and physical.</p><p>\"These new devices do more than just the tasks at hand, though, they also enable masses of data to be collected. Where that data goes, who uses it and for what, are new questions and raise new challenges.</p><p>\"Are our devices gossiping and judging us? Are they sharing our secrets and not-so secrets and with whom? What does it mean to talk about safety, privacy, security or even trust? Yet the technology won't make a different future, we will.\"</p><p>Professor Bell added: \"In 2016, Klaus Schwab, director of the World Economic Forum, wrote that we have entered into the fourth wave of industrialisation, one where we'll see the emergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS).</p><p>\"Think: drones, autonomous vehicles, manufacturing robots and smart lifts. CPS represents a significant shift in the application of AI, from discrete, computer-based automation to embedded in a range of physical, often mobile, objects.</p><p>\"And as these systems emerge, as robots and humans interact, as more data is produced and algorithms make sense of this data, we need to make sure we are asking the right questions.\"</p><p>7. AI will augment, not replace humans </p><p>Dr Nicola J Millard is a BT principal innovation partner. She isn't a technologist but combines psychology with futurology to try to anticipate what might be lying around the corner. She said:</p><p>\"Although artificial intelligence has yet to reach the sophistication of R2D2 or C3PO, there is no doubt that automation will impact us all in the future.</p><p>\"Augmented Intelligence, where humans and machines exploit each other's strengths, is likely to become an increasingly common way of working.\"</p><p>She added: \"Looking into the next decade, playing games, interpreting the stock market, writing articles about football, spotting patterns in large, messy data sets, and performing activities in highly structured and predictable environments are all relatively easy for machines to learn to do.</p><p>\"But by 2030 we'll also start to see AI taking a much more sophisticated shape as humans will start to trust machines to fly planes, diagnose illnesses and manage financial affairs unsupervised.</p><p>\"We'll also see artificial intelligence start to impact transport in a big way with smart cities and smart cars being the new norm.</p><p>\"But with AI comes moral dilemmas of many of these advancements.</p><p>\"Think for example of the self-driving car. Should the car swerve to avoid a pedestrian if it thinks that there is a high likelihood that its actions will injure the driver. And who is responsible?</p><p>\"This is a legal grey area that will need to be addressed in the future.\"</p><p>6. The abolition of ageing</p><p>\"Death, thou shalt die,\" wrote the 17th century metaphysical poet and Church of England cleric John Donne. His point was spiritual, but for David Wood, the co-leader Transhumanism UK, the \"abolition of ageing\" is a real goal to pursue.</p><p>He spoke to Sky News for <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.sky.com/story/off-limits-can-we-live-forever-11744787\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a fascinating episode of Off Limits</emphasis></url> earlier this year, alongside Dr Ian Pearson, a futurologist who has researched different ways to extend human life and pointed to advances in genetic studies.</p><p>Dr Pearson said: \"We're looking at the genetic modification side of things already, and we're looking at technologies in biotech that will allow us to play with telomeres [cells linked with the ageing process] on the end of the DNA strands.\"</p><p>He added: \"The technologies for life extension that IT offers are probably around the 2040, 2050, 2060 time frame, when we'll have the IT that will allow us to live pretty much forever, or at least until the IT stops working.</p><p>\"We will make direct links to the brain, and make replicas of your brain, or make an extension of your brain outside in the computer world.</p><p>\"Therefore your mind will carry on migrating into that computer area, and at some point in your distant future, 99% of your mind is living in the computer, so if your body dies you lose 1% of your mind.</p><p>\"The rest of it carries on as if nothing had happened. You buy an android, use that as your body from now on, and you carry on living.\"</p><p>5. Will the UK become a surveillance state? </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Silkie Carlo is the director of Big Brother Watch</emphasis></url>, a civil liberties NGO which campaigns against state surveillance in the UK. She told Sky News:</p><p>\"2020 will be a turning point for the future of surveillance in the UK.</p><p>\"We'll have a definitive judgment from the highest court in Europe on whether mass surveillance breaches human rights.</p><p>\"We'll also have pivotal fights against state and corporate uses of facial recognition, social media monitoring, encryption backdoors, automated decision making and predictive analytics.</p><p>\"In 10 years from now, we could be a mature surveillance state with a population that's watched, listened to, recorded and tracked more pervasively than ever before - and indeed, a population that records and tracks itself.</p><p>\"It could be a data-driven nation of ambient surveillance and constant quantification. Implants and biometrics would be part of everyday life and surveillance would lace the \"smart\" homes and cities we'd live in.</p><p>\"But it all depends on the choices we make in the next year or so.</p><p>\"If we make the right ones, we'll look back on this as the dark decade of surveillance - and the future will be one where technologies make us more free, not less.</p><p>4. Data becomes more honest</p><p>Renate Samson is a senior policy adviser at the Open Data Institute. Her vision of the future is one in which the value of data is collectively and collaboratively realised. She said:</p><p>\"Data is a new form of infrastructure for us and for society as a whole.</p><p>\"In 2030 the world of data will probably look much like it does today, but we will have a more nuanced approach to how we live our digital lives, though the opportunities for true control will likely remain weak and the consent model may be broken beyond repair.</p><p>\"The love affair with big data will have soured. Good, accurate, authoritative data will be the hot desire.</p><p>\"Rather than holding all the data all the time just in case, organisations will realise that using accurate data to address a specific problem will bring real value. Data collaboration by people rather than just business may also begin to be the norm.</p><p>\"Community will become more meaningful, people will seek to share and engage in smaller groups rather than long for the world to know everything.</p><p>\"This will partly be inspired by an exhaustion with fake news and falsehoods on social media, and the need for accurate, truthful information.</p><p>\"Individuals will have a greater sense of what data about them is and where their comfort with sharing lies.</p><p>\"We will become more attuned to the misuse of behavioural data about us. Privacy will continue to matter but it won't be a one size fits all. Concepts of ownership of data will persist amongst the few, but the majority will act collectively to challenge organisations who are unethical.</p><p>3. Recapturing human identity</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkofx.net\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Orlowski is director of the research network Think of X</emphasis></url>. He predicts that marketing-driven ideas about human identity which have been adopted by Facebook and Google will begin to recede. He said:</p><p>\"The public keeps delivering up shocks to our experts, who now seem to live in a perpetual state of surprise.</p><p>\"And for that you can blame the pop psychologist Malcolm Gladwell, the bestselling Canadian and the master of the quirky counter-intuitive pop science McNugget.</p><p>\"Following his success, psychologists and neuroscientists began crafting their work to appeal to this new audience.</p><p>\"Both wanted to make their accounts of how we behave to be 'scientific' - but their programs had fatal flaws. Psychologists became convinced that we were always wrong, and neuroscientists with extinguishing the idea of free will.</p><p>\"Instead of being complex Enlightenment-era individuals, we were really either rats, or badly flawed robots.</p><p>\"These ideas spread from marketing to our intelligentsia and captivated our policy makers.</p><p>\"So we've been nudged and \"game-ified\" in encounters where the manipulator hopes we don't notice the manipulation.</p><p>\"Google and Facebook promised the increasingly out-of-touch political class that they could not only understand our behaviour, but shape it too.</p><p>\"But the result was that by erasing what makes us human, the boffins had painted all the walls white and now couldn't find the door.</p><p>\"The explanations were useless. When everything was quirky and counter-intuitive, no intuition could be understood or predicted.</p><p>\"It doesn't help that both fields are now beset by crises: what is useful is not reproducible, and what's reproducible is not useful.</p><p>\"So my bet is that these fads have had their day. The 'why we do things' - the acknowledgement of human agency - will return to explanations of 'what we do'. It must, for who wants to be surprised all the time?</p><p> 2. The battle to regulate Big Tech</p><p>Rowland Manthorpe is the technology correspondent at Sky News. He found a serious issue in European efforts to tackle competition issues posed by the Silicon Valley giants. This is his analysis.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.sky.com/story/eu-competition-chief-struggles-to-tame-dark-side-of-big-tech-despite-record-fines-11893440\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a wide-ranging interview</emphasis></url> at the start of her second term as European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager acknowledged reforms demanded from firms such as Google don't \"necessarily change anything\" because the companies had \"already won the market\".</p><p>She cast doubt on the effectiveness of future changes to Google's Android mobile operating system, saying she was \"not holding my breath\".</p><p>Ms Vestager fined Google a record (EURO)4.3bn (\u00a33.9bn) in July 2018 for using Android to illegally \"cement its dominant position\" in search and forced it to make changes to restore competition to the marketplace.</p><p>But although Ms Vestager said Google would be introducing a \"preference menu\", offering users a choice of different browsers in the new year, she admitted she was not sure whether it would work.</p><p>She told Sky News: \"One of the very impressive competencies of Google as a company is their competence of making people make choices.\"</p><p>Asked if she meant that Google would drive users towards its own products, she replied: \"This is why it will be very interesting to see, how will such a menu of different options - how would that actually work?\"</p><p>Ms Vestager is beginning a second term as European commissioner for competition, with an expanded role that has seen her labelled the 'most powerful regulator of big tech on the planet'</p><p>In her first term, she levied record-breaking fines against Google and forced Amazon and Apple to pay huge sums in unpaid tax, drawing the ire of US President Donald Trump who said she must \"hate the US\".</p><p>Yet although she said she had been able to stop companies breaking European competition law, and punish past misconduct, she acknowledged that \"recovery of the markets\" was a \"work in progress\".</p><p> 1.

The following 10 trends will dominate blockchain technology in 2020: 1. Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)By Big Tech CompaniesOne of the promising blockchain trends in 2020 is BaaS, short for Blockchain As A Service. It is a new blockchain trend that is currently integrated with a number of startups as well as enterprises. BaaS is a cloud-based service that enables users to develop their own digital products by working with blockchain. These digital products may be smart contracts, decentralized applications (Dapps), or even other services that can work without any setup requirements of the complete blockchain-based infrastructure. </p><p>Some of the companies developing a blockchain that provide BaaS service are Microsoft and Amazon, consequently shaping the future of blockchain applications[2]. 2. Federated Blockchain Moves to The Center Stage Blockchain networks can be classified as: Private, Public, Federated or Hybrid. The term Federated Blockchain can be referred to as one of the best blockchain latest trends in the industry. It is merely an upgraded form of the basic blockchain model, which makes it more ideal for many specific use cases. In this type of blockchain, instead of one organization, multiple authorities can control the pre-selected nodes of blockchain. Now, this selected group of various nodes will validate the block so that the transactions can be processed further. In 2020, there will be a rise in the usage of federated blockchain as it provides private blockchain networks, a more customizable outlook.[3] 3. Stablecoins Will Be More VisibleUsing Bitcoin as an example of cryptocurrencies its highly volatile in nature. To avoid that volatility stablecoin came to the picture strongly with stable value associate with each coin. As of now, stablecoins are in their initial phase and it is predicted that 2020 will be the year when blockchain stablecoins[4] will achieve their all-time high. One driving force for using stablecoin is the introduction of Facebook's cryptocurrency 'Libra[5]' in 2020 even with all the challenges facing this new cryptocurrency proposed by Facebook and the shrinking circle of partners[6] in libra.org. 4. Social Networking Problems Meet Blockchain Solution; There are around 2.77 Billion social media users around the globe in 2019. The introduction of blockchain in social media will be able to solve the problems related to notorious scandals, privacy violations, data control, and content relevance. Therefore, the blockchain blend in the social media domain is another emerging technology trend in 2020. With the implementation of blockchain, it can be ensured that all the social media published data remain untraceable and cannot be duplicated, even after its deletion. Moreover, users will get to store data more securely and maintain their ownership. Blockchain also ensures that the power of content relevance lies in the hands of those who created it, instead of the platform owners. This makes the user feel more secure as they can control what they want to see. One daunting task is to convince social media platforms to implemented it, this can be on a voluntary base or as a results of privacy laws similar to GDPR[7]. 5. Interoperability and Blockchain Networks Blockchain interoperability is the ability to share data and other information across multiple blockchain systems as well as networks. This function makes it simple for the public to see and access the data across different blockchain networks. For example, you can send your data from one Ethereum blockchain to another specific blockchain network. Interoperability is a challenge but the benefits are vast[8]. 6. Economy and Finance Will Lead Blockchain Applications Unlike other traditional businesses, the banking and finance industries don't need to introduce radical transformation to their processes for adopting blockchain technology. After it was successfully applied for the cryptocurrency, financial institutions begin seriously considering blockchain adoption for traditional banking operations. PWC report, 77 percent of financial institutions are expected to adopt blockchain technology as part of an in-production system or process by 2020. Blockchain technology will allow banks to reduce excessive bureaucracy, conduct faster transactions at lower costs, and improve its secrecy. One of the blockchain predictions made by Gartner is that the banking industry will derive 1 billion dollars of business value from the use of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies by 2020. Moreover, blockchain can be used for launching new cryptocurrencies that will be regulated or influenced by monetary policy. In this way, banks want to reduce the competitive advantage of standalone cryptocurrencies and achieve greater control over their monetary policy[9]. 7. Blockchain Integration into Government Agencies The idea of the distributed ledger is also very attractive to government authorities that have to administrate very large quantities of data. Currently, each agency has its separate database, so they have to constantly require information about residents from each other. However, the implementation of blockchain technologies for effective data management will improve the functioning of such agencies. According to Gartner, by 2022, more than a billion people will have some data about them stored on a blockchain, but they may not be aware of it. Also, national cryptocurrencies will appear, it's inevitable that governments will have to recognize the benefits of blockchain-derived currencies. Digital money is the future[10] and nothing will stop. 8. Blockchain Combines with IoT The IoT tech market will see a renewed focus on security as complex safety challenges crop up. These complexities stem from the diverse and distributed nature of the technology. The number of Internet-connected devices has breached the 26 billion mark. Device and IoT network hacking will become commonplace in 2020. It is up to network operators to stop intruders from doing their business. The current centralized architecture of IoT is one of the main reasons for the vulnerability of IoT networks. With billions of devices connected and more to be added, IoT is a big target for cyber-attacks, which makes security extremely important. Blockchain[11]offers new hope for IoT security for several reasons. First, blockchain is public, everyone participating in the network of nodes of the blockchain network can see the blocks and the transactions stored and approves them, although users can still have private keys to control transactions. Second, blockchain is decentralized, so there is no single authority that can approve the transactions eliminating Single Point of Failure (SPOF) weakness. Third and most importantly, it's secure\u2014the database can only be extended and previous records cannot be changed[12]. Many IoT based companies adopts blockchain technology for their business solutions.The International Data Corporation (IDC) is expecting that 20 percent of IoT deployments will enable blockchain services by 2020[13]. 9. Blockchain with AI With theintegration of AI[14](Artificial Intelligence) with blockchain technology will make for a better development. This integration will show a level of improvement in blockchain technology with adequate amount of applications. The International Data Corporation (IDC) suggests that global spending on AI will reach $57.6 billion by 2020 and 51% of businesses will be making the transition to AI with blockchain integration. Additionally, blockchain can also make AI more coherent and understandable, and we can trace and determine why decisions are made in machine learning. Blockchain and its ledger can record all data and variables that go through a decision made under machine learning. Moreover, AI can boost blockchain efficiency far better than humans, or even standard computing can. A look at the way in which blockchains are currently run on standard computers proves this with a lot of processing power needed to perform even basic tasks Examples of applications of AI in Blockchain[15]: Smart Computing Power, Creating Diverse Data Sets, Data Protection, Data Monetization, Trusting AI Decision Making.10. Demand for Blockchain ExpertsBlockchain is a new technology and there are only few percent of individuals who are skilled in this technology. As blockchain technology becominga fast-increasing and wide-spreading technology, that creates a situation for many to develop skills and experience about blockchain technology. Even though the number of experts in blockchain fields is increasing, on the other hand the implementation of this technology has a rapid growth which will create a situation for the demand of Blockchain experts by 2020[16]. It's worth saying that there are genuine efforts by universities and colleges to catch up with this need, but the rate of graduating students with enough skills to deal with blockchain technology is not enough to fill the gap. Also, Companies are taking steps to build on their existing talents by adding training programs for developing and managing blockchain networks.

Buoyed by taxpayer-financed bailouts, banks recovered and business at most institutions stabilized. But if there is one lingering casualty of that era, it is the erosion of public trust in the financial sector. Ten years after the crisis began, Main Street still has little faith in Wall Street. A similar crisis of confidence plagues the technology industry today. As executives at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica rationalize their companies' use and abuse of personal data, trust in technology firms is approaching a tipping point. \"Big Tech\" can still salvage its reputation, but its most powerful companies will need to change fundamentally how they operate. And to do that, they must avoid the mistakes that nearly crippled the financial sector a decade ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Five key lessons from the financial crisis should guide decision-making in the tech sector today. First, consumer illiteracy can be costly. Shortly before the housing bubble burst, many investors realized they had no understanding of the products they were buying; some didn't even know they were buying anything. Financial journalism contributed to this atmosphere of ignorance by focusing only on the potential gains, and ignoring the risks.</p><p>People engage with technology in similar ways. Companies, governments, and businesses happily plug their entire operations into platforms they cannot control. Doubt, if it does arise, is usually subdued, because the technology is too convenient to abandon.</p><p>But, just like perilous financial products, the only way to mitigate the risks of new technologies is to be fully educated about what could go wrong.</p><p>The second lesson is that hidden costs add up. Before the financial crisis, many customers were sold products with undisclosed fees and financial add-ons that became massive liabilities. Today, more investors recognize that higher returns imply higher risk, but in the technology business, hidden costs continue to entrap unsuspecting consumers. Some of these costs are social \u2013 like being pressured by advertisers to buy products. And others are more tangible, like giving away personal data in exchange for access to a service.</p><p>Third, inequitable pay and incentive structures are bad for business. Much has been written about the extraordinary bonuses paid to investment bankers during the height of the financial crisis. But the CEOs of Silicon Valley are no Robin Hoods, either. Tech entrepreneurs might tell their investors they want to change the world, but many are intoxicated by the idea that the world will be better when they sell their business to the highest bidder.</p><p>Fourth, businesses that are male-dominated take more unnecessary risks. When the history of the financial crisis was being written, many argued that greater gender diversity would have mitigated the damage. In 2010, two years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Christine Lagarde, then-France's finance minister, quipped that the crisis would have been less painful if \"Lehman Sisters\" had been managing the store. The same logic applies to the tech sector today.</p><p>Finally, as we learned a decade ago, the global economy is deeply interconnected; no bank was too big to fail or to be rescued.</p><p>This is true for the largest technology companies as well. The collapse of Amazon or Google \u2013 however invulnerable they may seem \u2013 would have devastating ripple effects.</p><p>While many argue that it would be unwise to regulate technology firms with a view to concerns over censorship and access to knowledge, these companies, like their financial-sector counterparts, have grown too big to be left to their own devices.</p><p>In the decade since the financial crisis erupted, structural changes have helped stabilize the banking and financial-services industry. Regulations have increased transparency and improved consumer awareness. But the old dynamics, power structures, and bloated pay scales have largely survived. As a result, the sector's reputation remains in tatters.</p><p>For the technology industry to avoid a similar fate, its leaders must increase consumers' literacy about the products they offer \u2013 and the potential dangers they hold. CEOs must support regulation, increase workplace diversity, and make compensation and incentive structures more equitable. Above all, tech leaders should avoid the mistakes made by other industries navigating crisis. And no industry offers a more relevant case study than the one that almost took down the global economy.</p><p>Alexandra Borchardt is director of Strategic Development at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.

You have everything to lose, including lower prices, faster service, instant information, economic freedom, more products and the knowledge that the world is increasingly at your beck and iPhone call. All this is potentially at risk if the latest Big Government movements against the world's tech companies continue to escalate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The targets of these growing calls for government action - in Europe and North America - are leading technology companies whose names are household brands, including Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft. In Washington this week, lawyers for the three dominant social media players - Google, Twitter and Facebook - will appear before a Senate committee looking into foreign intervention in the U.S. electoral process.</p><p>But election politics is just the latest red flag of interventionist convenience flapping over the major internet companies. For several years, politicians and ideological activists have been intensifying their claims that the tech giants are a threat to democracy, that too much economic and political power has been accumulating in the hands of a small group of executives who control corporations that are slowly coming to dominate economic activity.</p><p>The economic rumblings increased last week when Google's parent (Alphabet Inc.), Amazon.com Inc., and Microsoft Corp.reported more big sales figures. All that income is said to be an indication of excessive market power and fresh evidence the companies are getting too big. It is time, say the crusaders, to bring in anti-trust laws to at least curb the growth of the Amazons and Googles of the world.</p><p>A typical handwringing came from the Financial Times editorial board: \"We are a long way from having reason to break up the tech giants,\" it said. \"It is clear, though, that they are using acquisitions to head off competition and leverage their dominance in new markets.\" Therefore, \"it is time for antitrust regulators to start blocking deals,\" like Amazon's recent takeover of Whole Foods.</p><p>Others want full-on trust busting, with calls for action coming from political actors on the left and right. Increasing numbers of conservatives such as William Kristol and Democrats such as <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>say the tech companies are engaging in \"monopolistic behaviour\" and need to be broken up. \"Concentration of power is a problem even if there's no immediate cost paid by consumers,\" Kristol has said.</p><p>This is where consumers should begin rising up. There is zero evidence that these companies are hurting consumers or that they ever will. On the contrary, by the current standard measures of anti-trust theory, the tech giants are giving consumers more of what they want and at prices they are more than happy to pay. That's why the companies are growing, contrary to the claims of alarmist anti-market critics and the contents of semi-populist books that portray the tech companies as manifestations of \"monopoly capitalism.\"</p><p>One such book, Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy, captures the key threads of the argument. In it, author Jonathan Taplin blames the rise of these supposed tech monopolies on Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman and a wild cabal of free-market theorists - including former U.S. judge and legal scholar Robert Bork, who allegedly singlehandedly sold policy-makers the idea that consumer benefit is the main criteria for assessing whether companies are engaging in destructive anti-competitive activities.</p><p>Consumer benefit is certainly the main test proposed by Bork in his classic 1978 book, The Anti-Trust Paradox. If successful companies, no matter how large, produce lower prices, greater efficiency and more and better products for consumers, claims of destructive monopoly and oligopolistic behaviour are unsustainable.</p><p>Bork's arguments, widely adopted over the years, were also a lot more complicated than merely positing consumer benefit as the sole test. He opposed price fixing and cartels, and insisted on evidence of the continued existence of competition, among other things.</p><p>What Taplin and many others want is to kill Bork's first idea - putting consumer welfare first - and reinstating the old trust-busting beliefs and theories from the early half of the 20(th) century: If it's big, it must be bad, even if it benefits consumers.</p><p>The economic arguments of the tech trust-busters are a regression to the idea that economic activity needs to be protected from the mauling aggression of big corporations. The route to competition is to protect smaller and existing companies. The claim is that the anti-trust focus on \"consumer welfare\" misses the problems created by the modern internet economy.</p><p>One anti-tech-trust activist - Lina M. Khan - wrote in the Yale Law Review last January that the full menace of Amazon cannot be grasped \"if we measure competition primarily through price and output.\" She said current doctrine that ignores the modern tech economy \"underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive.\"</p><p>Forget prices and output, forget consumer benefit, and concentrate instead on structure and bigness.</p><p>Not that Taplin and others of similar view think very much of consumers. Taplin ends Move Fast and Break Things with misty-eyed nostalgia for John Kenneth Galbraith's takedown of the affluent society and E.F. Schumacher's 1973 book, Small is Beautiful. Schumacher opposed raising the consumer's \"standard of living\" and the pursuit of higher levels of individual consumption, none of which would make humans happy, he said. Taplin says he wondered \"whether our smartphones were liberating us or just addicting us to more consumption.\"</p><p>The tech giants, says Taplin, are \"all built around the assumption that they hold the secret formula to continually arousing our desires. This may not be good for America, but it's good for Google, Amazon, and Facebook.\"</p><p>Anti-tech-trust warriors, like climate warriors, are just another gang of anti-consumer utopians. It's the same old anti-capitalist, anti-materialist, quasi-religious moralizing that dates back centuries. Consumers beware - and unite. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.
